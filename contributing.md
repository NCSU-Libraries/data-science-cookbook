## Contributing

To add a new "recipe," create a new git branch off the `main` branch. Then, create a new markdown (`.md`) file in the directory for that language, such as in `python/`.  

Each recipe should have a clear title, a short description of what it does, a list of necessary libraries, code blocks, and explanatory comments. You can find more information on Github's markdown [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax), with more detail on code blocks [here](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/writing-on-github/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks).

You can find a template for a new recipe in the `templates/` directory. 

To submit the new recipe for review, submit a PR against the `main` branch from your fork of the repository.
