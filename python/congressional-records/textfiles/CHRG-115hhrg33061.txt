BUSINESS MEETING: MARKUP OF COMMITTEE RESOLUTION 115-19
----------
TUESDAY, JUNE 26, 2018
House of Representatives,
Committee on House Administration,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 11:06 a.m., in Room
1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Gregg Harper
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Harper, Davis, Walker, Smith,
Loudermilk, and Brady.
Staff Present: Sean Moran, Staff Director; Kim Betz, Deputy
Staff Director/Policy and Oversight; Steven Wall, Deputy
General Counsel; Dan Jarrell, Legislative Clerk; Amanda Anger,
Professional Staff Member; Matt Field, Director of Oversight;
Erin McCracken, Communications Director; Jamie Fleet, Minority
Staff Director; Khalil Abboud, Minority Deputy Staff Director;

The Chairman. I now call to order the Committee on House
Administration for today's Committee meeting. A quorum is
present, so we may proceed.
The meeting record will remain open for 5 legislative days
so that Members may submit any materials that they wish to be
included therein.
There is one item on our docket today, Committee Resolution
115-19, a resolution to disburse $200,000 from the Committee's
Reserve Fund to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. This
disbursement is in response to a request the Committee received
from the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Committee on
Veterans' Affairs.
The disbursement will provide resources for the Committee
on Veterans' Affairs to establish a new Technology
Modernization Subcommittee. This new subcommittee will focus
its oversight efforts on the VA's $15.8 billion Electronic
Health Record Modernization Program, by far the largest
electronic health record transition ever attempted as well as
one of the Federal Government's biggest IT projects.
I would now like to recognize my colleague and the
Committee's Ranking Member, Mr. Brady, for the purpose of
providing an opening statement.
Mr. Brady. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, I support the funding request for the
Veterans' Committee. And I have received assurances from the
Ranking Member that he will have access to one-third of the
funds, consistent with their tradition of how money is spent on
a committee--for a committee is handled.
With that assurance, I support the request and urge my
colleagues to do the same.
And I yield back.
The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.
Does any other Member wish to be recognized for the purpose
of an opening statement?
I now call up and lay before the Committee Committee
Resolution 115-19. Without objection, the first reading is
dispensed with, and the resolution is considered read and open
for amendment.
[The information follows:]

The Chairman. Would any Member like to make a statement or
offer an amendment?
Seeing none, I move the Committee adopt Committee
Resolution 115-19.
The question is on the motion.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
All those opposed, signify by saying nay.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the
motion is agreed to.
Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon
the table.
Does any Member wish to submit supplemental or minority
views?
Seeing none, for all the matters considered here today, I
would ask unanimous consent that the staff be authorized to
make technical and conforming changes if necessary.
Without objection, so ordered.
That concludes today's markup. Without objection, the
markup is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:09 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
