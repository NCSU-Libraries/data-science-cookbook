TUESDAY, APRIL 10, 2018
U.S. Senate,
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, AND
Committee on the Judiciary,

Chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary, presiding.
Present from the Committee on Commerce, Science, and
Transportation: Senators Thune, Wicker, Blunt, Cruz, Fischer,
Moran, Sullivan, Heller, Inhofe, Johnson, Capito, Gardner,
Young, Nelson, Cantwell, Klobuchar, Blumenthal, Schatz, Markey,

Whitehouse, Klobuchar, Coons, Blumenthal, Hirono, Booker, and
Harris.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHUCK GRASSLEY,
U.S. SENATOR FROM IOWA
Chairman Grassley. The committees on the Judiciary and
Commerce, Science, and Transportation will come to order.
We welcome everyone to today's hearing on ``Facebook,
Social Media Privacy, and the Use and Abuse of Data.'' Although
not unprecedented, this is a unique hearing. The issues we will
consider range from data privacy and security to consumer
protection and the Federal Trade Commission enforcement,
touching on jurisdictions of these two committees.
We have 44 members between our two committees. That may not
seem like a large group by Facebook standards, but it is
significant here for a hearing in the United States Senate. We
will do our best to keep things moving efficiently, given our
circumstances.
We will begin with opening statements from the chairmen and
ranking members of each committee, starting with Chairman
Thune, and then proceed with Mr. Zuckerberg's opening
statement. We will then move on to questioning. Each member
will have 5 minutes to question witnesses.
I would like to remind the members of both committees that
time limits will be and must be strictly enforced given the
numbers that we have here today. If you are over your time,
Chairman Thune and I will make sure to let you know. There will
not be a second round as well. Of course, there will be the
usual follow-up written questions through the record.
Questioning will alternate between majority and minority and
between committees. We will proceed in order based on
respective committee seniority.
We will anticipate a couple short breaks later in the
afternoon, and so it is my pleasure to recognize the Chairman
of the Commerce Committee, Chairman Thune, for his opening
statement.
STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE,
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Chairman Grassley.
Today's hearing is extraordinary. It is extraordinary to
hold a joint committee hearing. It is even more extraordinary
to have a single CEO testify before nearly half of the U.S.
Senate. But then Facebook is pretty extraordinary. More than 2
billion people use Facebook every month. One point four billion
people use it every day, more than the population of any
country on Earth except China and more than four times the
population of the United States. It is also more than 1,500
times the population of my home state of South Dakota. Plus,
roughly 45 percent of American adults report getting at least
some of their news from Facebook.
In many respects, Facebook's incredible reach is why we are
here today. We are here because of what you, Mr. Zuckerberg,
have described as a breach of trust. A quiz app used by
approximately 300,000 people led to information about 87
million Facebook users being obtained by the company Cambridge
Analytica. There are plenty of questions about the behavior of
Cambridge Analytica, and we expect to hold a future hearing on
Cambridge and similar firms.
But as you have said, this is not likely to be an isolated
incident, a fact demonstrated by Facebook's suspension of
another firm just this past weekend. You have promised that
when Facebook discovers other apps that access to large amounts
of user data, you will ban them and tell those affected. And
that is appropriate. But it is unlikely to be enough for the 2
billion Facebook users.
One reason that so many people are worried about this
incident is what it says about how Facebook works. The idea
that for every person who decided to try an app, information
about nearly 300 other people was scraped from your services,
to put it mildly, disturbing. And the fact that those 87
million people may have technically consented to making their
data available does not make most people feel any better.
The recent revelation that malicious actors were able to
utilize Facebook's default privacy settings to match e-mail
addresses and phone numbers found on the so-called dark web to
public Facebook profiles, potentially affecting all Facebook
users, only adds fuel to the fire.
What binds these two incidents is that they do not appear
to be caused by the kind of negligence that allows typical data
breaches to happen. Instead, they both appear to be the result
of people exploiting the very tools that you have created to
manipulate users' information.
I know Facebook has taken several steps and intends to take
more to address these issues. Nevertheless, some have warned
that the actions Facebook is taking to ensure that third
parties do not obtain data from unsuspecting users, while
necessary, will actually serve to enhance Facebook's own
ability to market such data exclusively.
Most of us understand that, whether you are using Facebook
or Google or some other online services, we are trading certain
information about ourselves for free or low-cost services. But
for this model to persist, both sides of the bargain need to
know the stakes that are involved. Right now, I am not
convinced that Facebook users have the information that they
need to make meaningful choices.
In the past, many of my colleagues on both sides of the
aisle have been willing to defer to tech companies' efforts to
regulate themselves, but this may be changing. Just last month,
in overwhelming bipartisan fashion, Congress voted to make it
easier for prosecutors and victims to go after websites that
knowingly facilitate sex trafficking. This should be a wake-up
call for the tech community. We want to hear more without delay
about what Facebook and other companies plan to do to take
greater responsibility for what happens on their platforms. How
will you protect users' data? How will you inform users about
the changes that you are making? And how do you intend to
proactively stop harmful conduct instead of being forced to
respond to it months or years later?
Mr. Zuckerberg, in many ways, you and the company that you
have created, the story that you have created represent the
American dream. Many are incredibly inspired by what you have
done. At the same time, you have an obligation and it is up to
you to ensure that that dream does not become a privacy
nightmare for the scores of people who use Facebook.
This hearing is an opportunity to speak to those who
believe in Facebook and to those who are deeply skeptical about
it. We are listening, America is listening, and quite possibly,
the world is listening, too.
Chairman Grassley. Thank you. And now, Ranking Member
Feinstein.
STATEMENT OF HON. DIANNE FEINSTEIN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA
Senator Feinstein. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Grassley, Chairman Thune, thank you both for holding
this hearing.
Mr. Zuckerberg, thank you for being here. You have a real
opportunity this afternoon to lead the industry and demonstrate
a meaningful commitment to protecting individual privacy.
We have learned over the past few months, and we have
learned a great deal that is alarming. We have seen how foreign
actors are abusing social media platforms like Facebook to
interfere in elections and take millions of Americans' personal
information without their knowledge in order to manipulate
public opinion and target individual voters.
Specifically, on February 16, Special Counsel Mueller
issued an indictment against the Russia-based Internet Research
Agency and 13 of its employees for interfering with operations
targeting the United States. Through this 37-page indictment,
we learned that the IRA ran a coordinated campaign through 470
Facebook accounts and pages. The campaign included ads and
false information to create discord and harm Secretary
Clinton's campaign. And the content was seen by an estimated
157 million Americans.
A month later, on March 17, news broke that Cambridge
Analytica exploited the personal information of approximately
50 million Facebook users without their knowledge or
permission. And last week, we learned that number was even
higher, 87 million Facebook users who had their private
information taken without their consent. Specifically, using a
personality quiz he created, Professor Kogan collected the
personal information of 300,000 Facebook users and then
collected data on millions of their friends. It appears the
information collected included everything these individuals had
on their Facebook pages and, according to some reports, even
included private direct messages between users.
Professor Kogan is said to have taken data from over 70
million Americans. It has also been reported that he sold this
data to Cambridge Analytica for $800,000. Cambridge Analytica
then took this data and created a psychological welfare tool to
influence United States elections. In fact, the CEO Alexander
Nix declared that Cambridge Analytica ran all the digital
campaign, the television campaign, and its data informed all
the strategy for the Trump campaign. The reporting has also
speculated that Cambridge Analytica worked with the Internet
Research Agency to help Russia identify which American voters
to target with its propaganda.
I am concerned that press reports indicate Facebook learned
about this breach in 2015 but appears not to have taken
significant steps to address it until this year.
So this hearing is important, and I appreciate the
conversation we had yesterday. And I believe that Facebook,
through your presence here today and the words you are about to
tell us, will indicate how strongly your industry will regulate
and/or reform the platforms that they control. I believe this
is extraordinarily important. You lead a big company with
27,000 employees, and we very much look forward to your
comments.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Grassley. Thank you, Senator Feinstein.
The history and growth of Facebook mirrors that of many of
our technological giants. Founded by Mr. Zuckerberg in 2004,
Facebook has exploded over the past 14 years. Facebook
currently has over 2.13 billion monthly active users across the
world, over than 25,000 employees, and offices in 13 U.S.
cities and various other countries.
Like their expanding user base, the data collected on
Facebook users has also skyrocketed. They have moved on from
schools, likes, and relationship statuses. Today, Facebook has
access to dozens of data points, ranging from ads that you have
clicked on, events you have attended, and your location based
upon your mobile device.
It is no secret that Facebook makes money off this data
through advertising revenue, although many seem confused by, or
altogether unaware, of this fact. Facebook generated $40
billion in revenue in 2017, with about 98 percent coming from
advertising across Facebook and Instagram.
Significant data collection is also occurring at Google,
Twitter, Apple, and Amazon. An ever-expanding portfolio of
products and services offered by these companies grant endless
opportunities to collect increasing amounts of information on
their customers. As we get more free or extremely low-cost
services, the tradeoff for the American consumer is to provide
more personal data. The potential for further growth and
innovation based on collection of data is limitless. However,
the potential for abuse is also significant.
While the contours of the Cambridge Analytica situation are
still coming to light, there was clearly a breach of consumer
trust and a likely improper transfer of data. The Judiciary
Committee will hold a separate hearing exploring Cambridge and
other data privacy issues. More importantly though, these
events have ignited a larger discussion on consumers'
expectations and the future of data privacy in our society. It
has exposed that consumers may not fully understand or
appreciate the extent to which their data is collected,
protected, transferred, used, and misused.
Data has been used in advertising and political campaigns
for decades. The amount and type of data obtained, however, has
seen a very dramatic change. Campaigns, including Presidents
Bush, Obama, and Trump, all used these increasing amounts of
data to focus on micro-targeting and personalization over
numerous social media platforms, and especially Facebook.
In fact, President Obama's campaign developed an app
utilizing the same Facebook feature as Cambridge Analytica to
capture the information of not just the apps users, but
millions of their friends. The digital director for that
campaign for 2012 described the data-scraping app as something
that would, ``wind up being the most groundbreaking piece of
technology developed for this campaign.''
So the effectiveness of these social media tactics can be
debated, but their use over the past years across the political
spectrum and their increased significance cannot be ignored.
Our policy toward data privacy and security must keep pace with
these changes. Data privacy should be tethered to consumer
needs and expectations.
Now, at a minimum, consumers must have the transparency
necessary to make an informed decision about whether to share
their data and how it can be used. Consumers ought to have
clear information, not opaque policies and complex click-
through consent pages. The tech industry has an obligation to
respond to widespread and growing concerns over data privacy
and security and to restore the public's trust. The status quo
no longer works.
Moreover, Congress must determine if and how we need to
strengthen privacy standards to ensure transparency and
understanding for the billions of consumers who utilize these
products.

STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON,
U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA
Senator Nelson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg, good afternoon.
Let me just cut to the chase. If you and other social media
companies do not get your act in order, none of us are going to
have any privacy anymore. That is what we are facing. We are
talking about personally identifiable information that, if not
kept by the social media companies from theft, we will not have
our personal privacy anymore, a value that we have in America.
It is the advent of technology, and of course all of us are
part of it. From the moment that we wake up in the morning
until we go to bed, we are on those handheld tablets, and
online companies like Facebook are tracking our activities and
collecting information. Facebook has a responsibility to
protect this personal information.
We had a good discussion yesterday. We went over all of
this. You told me that the company had failed to protect
privacy. It is not the first time that Facebook has mishandled
its users' information. The FTC found that Facebook's privacy
policies had deceived users in the past. And in the present
case, we recognize that Cambridge Analytica and an app
developer lied to consumers and lied to you, lied to Facebook,
but did Facebook watch over the operations? We want to know
that. And why did Facebook not notify 87 million users that
their personally identifiable information had been taken? And
why were they not informed that it was also being used for
unauthorized political purposes?
So only now--and I appreciate our conversation. Only now,
Facebook has pledged to inform those consumers whose accounts
were compromised. I think you are genuine. I got that sense in
conversing with you. You want to do the right thing. You want
to enact reforms. We want to know if it is going to be enough.
And I hope that will be in the answers today.
Now, since we still do not know what Cambridge Analytica
has done with this data, you heard Chairman Thune say, as we
have discussed, we want to haul Cambridge Analytica in to
answer these questions at a separate hearing.
I want to thank Chairman Thune for working with all of us
on scheduling a hearing. There is obviously a great deal of
interest in this subject. I hope we can get to the bottom of
this. And if Facebook and other online companies will not or
cannot fix the privacy invasions, then we are going to have to,
we, the Congress. How can American consumers trust folks like
your company to be caretakers of their most personal and
identifiable information? And that is the question. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Senator Nelson follows:]
Prepared Statement of Hon. Bill Nelson, U.S. Senator from Florida
Let me get to the point, one that I made to Mr. Zuckerberg
yesterday during our lengthy conversation in my office. If Facebook and
other social media and online companies don't do a better job as
stewards of our personal information, American consumers are no longer
going to have any privacy to protect.
From the minute consumers wake up to the minute they put down their
smartphone at the end of the day, online companies like Facebook are
tracking their activities and collecting information. Facebook has a
responsibility to protect this personal information.
Unfortunately, I believe that the company failed to do so. This is
not the first time that Facebook has mishandled its users' information.
The Federal Trade Commission found that Facebook's privacy policies had
deceived users in the past.
In the present case, I recognize that Cambridge Analytica and an
app developer lied to consumers and lied to Facebook. But did Facebook
watch over their operations? And why didn't Facebook notify eighty-
seven million users when it discovered that Cambridge Analytica had
inappropriately gotten hold of their sensitive information and was
using it for unauthorized political purposes?
Only now has Facebook pledged to inform those consumers whose
accounts were compromised. I know Mr. Zuckerberg wants to do the right
thing and enact reforms, but will it be enough? I hope to get some
answers today.
Lastly, we still don't know exactly what Cambridge Analytica has
done with this data. That's why I have asked Chairman Thune to haul
Cambridge Analytica in to answer these questions at a separate hearing.
I want to thank the chairman for working with me on scheduling a
hearing in the near future.
There is obviously a great deal of interest in this subject, and I
hope that we can get to the bottom line. That is, if Facebook and other
online companies will not or cannot fix these privacy invasions, then
we will. How can American consumers trust them to be caretakers of
their most personal and identifiable information?
Chairman Grassley. Thank you, my colleagues, and Senator
Nelson.
Our witness today is Mark Zuckerberg, Founder, Chairman,
Chief Executive Officer of Facebook. Mr. Zuckerberg launched
Facebook February 4, 2004, at the age of 19. And at that time
he was a student at Harvard University. As I mentioned
previously, his company now has over $40 billion of annual
revenue and over 2 billion monthly active users. Mr.
Zuckerberg, along with his wife, also established the Chan
Zuckerberg Initiative to further philanthropic causes.
I now turn to you. Welcome to the Committee. And whatever
your statement is orally, if you have a longer one, it will be
included in the record. So, proceed, sir.
STATEMENT OF MARK ZUCKERBERG, CHAIRMAN
AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FACEBOOK
Mr. Zuckerberg. Chairman Grassley, Chairman Thune, Ranking
Member Feinstein, and Ranking Member Nelson and members of the
Committee, we face a number of important issues around privacy,
safety, and democracy, and you will rightfully have some hard
questions for me to answer. Before I talk about the steps we
are taking to address them, I want to talk about how we got
here.
Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company. For most
of our existence, we focused on all of the good that connecting
people can do. And as Facebook has grown, people everywhere
have gotten a powerful new tool for staying connected to the
people they love, for making their voices heard, and for
building communities and businesses. Just recently, we have
seen the #metoo movement and the March for Our Lives organized,
at least in part, on Facebook. After Hurricane Harvey, people
came together to raise more than $20 million for relief. And
more than 70 million small businesses use Facebook to create
jobs and grow.
But it is clear now that we did not do enough to prevent
these tools for being used for harm as well, and that goes for
fake news, for foreign interference in elections, and hate
speech, as well as developers and data privacy. We did not take
a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big
mistake. And it was my mistake, and I am sorry. I started
Facebook, I run it, and I am responsible for what happens here.
So now, we have to go through all of our relationship with
people and make sure that we are taking a broad enough view of
our responsibility. It is not enough to just connect people; we
have to make sure that those connections are positive. It is
not enough to just give people a voice; we need to make sure
that people are not using it to harm other people or to spread
misinformation. And it is not enough to just give people
control over their information; we need to make sure that the
developers they share it with protect their information, too.
Across the board, we have a responsibility to not just build
tools but to make sure that they are used for good.
It will take some time to work through all the changes we
need to make across the company, but I am committed to getting
this right. This includes the basic responsibility of
protecting people's information, which we failed to do with
Cambridge Analytica. So here are a few things that we are doing
to address this and to prevent it from happening again.
First, we are getting to the bottom of exactly what
Cambridge Analytica did and telling everyone affected. What we
know now is that Cambridge Analytica improperly accessed some
information about millions of Facebook members by buying it
from an app developer. This was information that people
generally shared publicly on their Facebook pages like names
and their profile picture and the pages they follow.
When we first contacted Cambridge Analytica, they told us
that they had deleted the data. About a month ago, we heard new
reports that suggested that was not true. And now, we are
working with governments in the U.S., the U.K., and around the
world to do a full audit of what they have done and to make
sure that they get rid of any data they may still have.
Second, to make sure no other app developers out there are
misusing data, we are now investigating every single app that
had access to a large amount of information in the past. And if
we find that someone improperly used data, we are going to ban
them from Facebook and tell everyone affected.
Third, to prevent this from ever happening again going
forward, we are making sure that developers cannot access as
much information now. The good news here is that we already
made big changes to our platform in 2014 that would have
prevented this specific situation with Cambridge Analytica from
occurring again today. But there is more to do, and you can
find more details on the steps we are taking in my written
statement.
My top priority has always been our social mission of
connecting people, building community, and bringing the world
closer together. Advertisers and developers will never take
priority over that as long as I am running Facebook.
I started Facebook when I was in college. We have come a
long way since then. We now serve more than 2 billion people
around the world, and every day, people use our services to
stay connected with the people that matter to them most. I
believe deeply in what we are doing, and I know that when we
address these challenges, we will look back and view helping
people connect and giving more people a voice is a positive
force in the world.
I realize the issues we are talking about today are not
just issues for Facebook and our community; they are issues and
challenges for all of us as Americans.
Thank you for having me here today, and I am ready to take
your questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Zuckerberg follows:]
Prepared Statement of Mark Zuckerberg, Chairman
and Chief Executive Officer, Facebook
I. Introduction
Chairman Grassley, Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Feinstein,
Ranking Member Nelson, and Members of the Committees,
We face a number of important issues around privacy, safety, and
democracy, and you will rightfully have some hard questions for me to
answer. Before I talk about the steps we're taking to address them, I
want to talk about how we got here.
Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company. For most of our
existence, we focused on all the good that connecting people can bring.
As Facebook has grown, people everywhere have gotten a powerful new
tool to stay connected to the people they love, make their voices
heard, and build communities and businesses. Just recently, we've seen
the #metoo movement and the March for Our Lives, organized, at least in
part, on Facebook. After Hurricane Harvey, people raised more than $20
million for relief. And more than 70 million small businesses now use
Facebook to grow and create jobs.
But it's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools
from being used for harm as well. That goes for fake news, foreign
interference in elections, and hate speech, as well as developers and
data privacy. We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility,
and that was a big mistake. It was my mistake, and I'm sorry. I started
Facebook, I run it, and I'm responsible for what happens here.
So now we have to go through every part of our relationship with
people and make sure we're taking a broad enough view of our
responsibility.
It's not enough to just connect people, we have to make sure those
connections are positive. It's not enough to just give people a voice,
we have to make sure people aren't using it to hurt people or spread
misinformation. It's not enough to give people control of their
information, we have to make sure developers they've given it to are
protecting it too. Across the board, we have a responsibility to not
just build tools, but to make sure those tools are used for good.
It will take some time to work through all of the changes we need
to make, but I'm committed to getting it right.
That includes improving the way we protect people's information and
safeguard elections around the world. Here are a few key things we're
doing:
II. Cambridge Analytica
Over the past few weeks, we've been working to understand exactly
what happened with Cambridge Analytica and taking steps to make sure
this doesn't happen again. We took important actions to prevent this
from happening again today four years ago, but we also made mistakes,
there's more to do, and we need to step up and do it.
A. What Happened
In 2007, we launched the Facebook Platform with the vision that
more apps should be social. Your calendar should be able to show your
friends' birthdays, your maps should show where your friends live, and
your address book should show their pictures. To do this, we enabled
people to log into apps and share who their friends were and some
information about them.
In 2013, a Cambridge University researcher named Aleksandr Kogan
created a personality quiz app. It was installed by around 300,000
people who agreed to share some of their Facebook information as well
as some information from their friends whose privacy settings allowed
it. Given the way our platform worked at the time this meant Kogan was
able to access some information about tens of millions of their
friends.
In 2014, to prevent abusive apps, we announced that we were
changing the entire platform to dramatically limit the Facebook
information apps could access. Most importantly, apps like Kogan's
could no longer ask for information about a person's friends unless
their friends had also authorized the app. We also required developers
to get approval from Facebook before they could request any data beyond
a user's public profile, friend list, and e-mail address. These actions
would prevent any app like Kogan's from being able to access as much
Facebook data today.
In 2015, we learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had
shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica. It is against our
policies for developers to share data without people's consent, so we
immediately banned Kogan's app from our platform, and demanded that
Kogan and other entities he gave the data to, including Cambridge
Analytica, formally certify that they had deleted all improperly
acquired data--which they ultimately did.
Last month, we learned from The Guardian, The New York Times and
Channel 4 that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted the data as
they had certified. We immediately banned them from using any of our
services. Cambridge Analytica claims they have already deleted the data
and has agreed to a forensic audit by a firm we hired to investigate
this. We're also working with the U.K. Information Commissioner's
Office, which has jurisdiction over Cambridge Analytica, as it
completes its investigation into what happened.
B. What We Are Doing
We have a responsibility to make sure what happened with Kogan and
Cambridge Analytica doesn't happen again. Here are some of the steps
we're taking:
Safeguarding our platform. We need to make sure that
developers like Kogan who got access to a lot of information in
the past can't get access to as much information going forward.
We made some big changes to the Facebook platform in
2014 to dramatically restrict the amount of data that
developers can access and to proactively review the apps on
our platform. This makes it so a developer today can't do
what Kogan did years ago.
But there's more we can do here to limit the
information developers can access and put more safeguards
in place to prevent abuse.
We're removing developers' access to your data if you
haven't used their app in three months.
We're reducing the data you give an app when you
approve it to only your name, profile photo, and e-mail
address. That's a lot less than apps can get on any other
major app platform.
We're requiring developers to not only get approval
but also to sign a contract that imposes strict
requirements in order to ask anyone for access to their
posts or other private data.
We're restricting more APIs like groups and events.
You should be able to sign into apps and share your public
information easily, but anything that might also share
other people's information--like other posts in groups
you're in or other people going to events you're going to--
will be much more restricted.
Two weeks ago, we found out that a feature that lets
you look someone up by their phone number and e-mail was
abused. This feature is useful in cases where people have
the same name, but it was abused to link people's public
Facebook information to a phone number they already had.
When we found out about the abuse, we shut this feature
down.
Investigating other apps. We're in the process of
investigating every app that had access to a large amount of
information before we locked down our platform in 2014. If we
detect suspicious activity, we'll do a full forensic audit. And
if we find that someone is improperly using data, we'll ban
them and tell everyone affected.
Building better controls. Finally, we're making it easier to
understand which apps you've allowed to access your data. This
week we started showing everyone a list of the apps you've used
and an easy way to revoke their permissions to your data. You
can already do this in your privacy settings, but we're going
to put it at the top of News Feed to make sure everyone sees
it. And we also told everyone whose Facebook information may
have been shared with Cambridge Analytica.
Beyond the steps we had already taken in 2014, I believe these are
the next steps we must take to continue to secure our platform.
III. Russian Election Interference
Facebook's mission is about giving people a voice and bringing
people closer together. Those are deeply democratic values and we're
proud of them. I don't want anyone to use our tools to undermine
democracy. That's not what we stand for.
We were too slow to spot and respond to Russian interference, and
we're working hard to get better. Our sophistication in handling these
threats is growing and improving quickly. We will continue working with
the government to understand the full extent of Russian interference,
and we will do our part not only to ensure the integrity of free and
fair elections around the world, but also to give everyone a voice and
to be a force for good in democracy everywhere.
A. What Happened
Elections have always been especially sensitive times for our
security team, and the 2016 U.S. presidential election was no
exception.
Our security team has been aware of traditional Russian cyber
threats--like hacking and malware--for years. Leading up to Election
Day in November 2016, we detected and dealt with several threats with
ties to Russia. This included activity by a group called APT28, that
the U.S. Government has publicly linked to Russian military
intelligence services.
But while our primary focus was on traditional threats, we also saw
some new behavior in the summer of 2016 when APT28-related accounts,
under the banner of DC Leaks, created fake personas that were used to
seed stolen information to journalists. We shut these accounts down for
violating our policies.
After the election, we continued to investigate and learn more
about these new threats. What we found was that bad actors had used
coordinated networks of fake accounts to interfere in the election:
promoting or attacking specific candidates and causes, creating
distrust in political institutions, or simply spreading confusion. Some
of these bad actors also used our ads tools.
We also learned about a disinformation campaign run by the Internet
Research Agency (IRA)--a Russian agency that has repeatedly acted
deceptively and tried to manipulate people in the U.S., Europe, and
Russia. We found about 470 accounts and pages linked to the IRA, which
generated around 80,000 Facebook posts over about a two-year period.
Our best estimate is that approximately 126 million people may have
been served content from a Facebook Page associated with the IRA at
some point during that period. On Instagram, where our data on reach is
not as complete, we found about 120,000 pieces of content, and estimate
that an additional 20 million people were likely served it.
Over the same period, the IRA also spent approximately $100,000 on
more than 3,000 ads on Facebook and Instagram, which were seen by an
estimated 11 million people in the United States. We shut down these
IRA accounts in August 2017.
B. What We Are Doing
There's no question that we should have spotted Russian
interference earlier, and we're working hard to make sure it doesn't
happen again. Our actions include:
Building new technology to prevent abuse. Since 2016, we
have improved our techniques to prevent nation states from
interfering in foreign elections, and we've built more advanced
AI tools to remove fake accounts more generally. There have
been a number of important elections since then where these new
tools have been successfully deployed. For example:
In France, leading up to the presidential election in
2017, we found and took down 30,000 fake accounts.
In Germany, before the 2017 elections, we worked
directly with the election commission to learn from them
about the threats they saw and to share information.
In the U.S. Senate Alabama special election last year,
we deployed new AI tools that proactively detected and
removed fake accounts from Macedonia trying to spread
misinformation.
We have disabled thousands of accounts tied to
organized, financially motivated fake news spammers. These
investigations have been used to improve our automated
systems that find fake accounts.
Last week, we took down more than 270 additional pages
and accounts operated by the IRA and used to target people
in Russia and Russian speakers in countries like
Azerbaijan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. Some of the pages we
removed belong to Russian news organizations that we
determined were controlled by the IRA.
Significantly increasing our investment in security. We now
have about 15,000 people working on security and content
review. We'll have more than 20,000 by the end of this year.
I've directed our teams to invest so much in
security--on top of the other investments we're making--
that it will significantly impact our profitability going
forward. But I want to be clear about what our priority is:
protecting our community is more important than maximizing
our profits.
Strengthening our advertising policies. We know some Members
of Congress are exploring ways to increase transparency around
political or issue advertising, and we're happy to keep working
with Congress on that. But we aren't waiting for legislation to
act.
From now on, every advertiser who wants to run
political or issue ads will need to be authorized. To get
authorized, advertisers will need to confirm their identity
and location. Any advertiser who doesn't pass will be
prohibited from running political or issue ads. We will
also label them and advertisers will have to show you who
paid for them. We're starting this in the U.S. and
expanding to the rest of the world in the coming months.
For even greater political ads transparency, we have
also built a tool that lets anyone see all of the ads a
page is running. We're testing this in Canada now and we'll
launch it globally this summer. We're also creating a
searchable archive of past political ads.
We will also require people who manage large pages to
be verified as well. This will make it much harder for
people to run pages using fake accounts, or to grow virally
and spread misinformation or divisive content that way.
In order to require verification for all of these
pages and advertisers, we will hire thousands of more
people. We're committed to getting this done in time for
the critical months before the 2018 elections in the U.S.
as well as elections in Mexico, Brazil, India, Pakistan and
elsewhere in the next year.
These steps by themselves won't stop all people trying
to game the system. But they will make it a lot harder for
anyone to do what the Russians did during the 2016 election
and use fake accounts and pages to run ads. Election
interference is a problem that's bigger than any one
platform, and that's why we support the Honest Ads Act.
This will help raise the bar for all political advertising
online.
Sharing information. We've been working with other
technology companies to share information about threats, and
we're also cooperating with the U.S. and foreign governments on
election integrity.
At the same time, it's also important not to lose sight of the more
straightforward and larger ways Facebook plays a role in elections.
In 2016, people had billions of interactions and open discussions
on Facebook that may never have happened offline. Candidates had direct
channels to communicate with tens of millions of citizens. Campaigns
spent tens of millions of dollars organizing and advertising online to
get their messages out further. And we organized ``get out the vote''
efforts that helped more than 2 million people register to vote who
might not have voted otherwise.
Security--including around elections--isn't a problem you ever
fully solve. Organizations like the IRA are sophisticated adversaries
who are constantly evolving, but we'll keep improving our techniques to
stay ahead. And we'll also keep building tools to help more people make
their voices heard in the democratic process.
IV. Conclusion
My top priority has always been our social mission of connecting
people, building community and bringing the world closer together.
Advertisers and developers will never take priority over that as long
as I'm running Facebook.
I started Facebook when I was in college. We've come a long way
since then. We now serve more than 2 billion people around the world,
and every day, people use our services to stay connected with the
people that matter to them most. I believe deeply in what we're doing.
And when we address these challenges, I know we'll look back and view
helping people connect and giving more people a voice as a positive
force in the world.
I realize the issues we're talking about today aren't just issues
for Facebook and our community--they're challenges for all of us as
Americans. Thank you for having me here today, and I'm ready to take
your questions.
Chairman Grassley. I will remind members that maybe were
not here when I had my opening comments that we are operating
under the five-minute rule, and that applies to the----
[Laughter.]
Chairman Grassley. The five-minute rule, and that applies
to those of us who are chairing the Committee as well.
I will start with you. Facebook handles extensive amounts
of personal data for billions of users. A significant amount of
that data is shared with third-party developers who utilize
your platform. As of early this year, you did not actively
monitor whether that data was transferred by such developers to
other parties. Moreover, your policies only prohibit transfers
by developers to parties seeking to profit from such data.
Number one, besides Professor Kogan's transfer and now
potentially Cubeyou, do you know of any instances where user
data was improperly transferred to a third party in breach of
Facebook's terms? If so, how many times has that happened, and
was Facebook only made aware of that transfer by some third
party?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Chairman, thank you. As I mentioned, we
are now conducting a full investigation into every single app
that had access to a large amount of information before we
locked down platform to prevent developers from accessing this
information around 2014. We believe that we are going to be
investigating many apps, tens of thousands of apps, and if we
find any suspicious activity, we are going to conduct a full
audit of those apps to understand how they are using their data
and if they are doing anything improper. And if we find it they
are doing anything improper, we will ban them from Facebook and
we will tell everyone affected.
As for past activity, I do not have all the examples of
apps that we have banned here, but if you would like, I can
have my team follow up with you after this.
Chairman Grassley. OK. Have you ever required an audit to
ensure the deletion of improperly transferred data, and if so,
how many times?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Chairman, yes, we have. I do not have
the exact figure on how many times we have, but overall, the
way we have enforced our platform policies in the past is we
have looked at patterns of how apps have used our APIs and
accessed information, as well as looked into reports that
people have made to us about apps that might be doing sketchy
things.
Going forward, we are going to take a more proactive
position on this and do much more regular spot-checks and other
reviews of apps, as well as increasing the amount of audits
that we do. And again, I can make sure that our team follows up
with you on anything about the specific past stats that would
be interesting.
Chairman Grassley. I was going to assume that sitting here
today you have no idea, and if I am wrong on that, if you are
able--you are telling me I think that you are able to supply
those figures to us at least as of this point.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Chairman, I will have my team follow up
with you on what information we have.
[The information referred to follows:]
Do you know of any instances where user data was improperly
transferred to a third party in breach of Facebook's terms? If so, how
many times has that happened, and was Facebook only made aware of that
transfer by some third party?
Facebook's policies regarding third-party usage of its platform
technologies have prohibited--and continue to prohibit--those third-
party app developers from selling or licensing user data obtained from
Facebook and from sharing any user data obtained from Facebook with any
ad network, data broker, or other advertising or monetization-related
service. We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts
of information before we changed our platform in 2014 to reduce data
access, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with suspicious
activity.
Have you ever required an audit to ensure the deletion of
improperly transferred data? And if so, how many times?
We use a variety of tools to enforce Facebook policies against
violating parties, including developers. We review tens of thousands of
apps per year and regularly disapprove noncompliant apps as part of our
proactive review process. We also use tools like cease and desist
letters, account suspensions, letter agreements, and civil litigation.
For example, since 2006, Facebook has sent over 1,150 cease-and-desist
letters to over 1,600 targets. In 2017, we took action against about
370,000 apps, ranging from imposing certain restrictions to removal of
the app from the platform. Moreover, we have required parties who have
procured our data without authorization to delete that data. We have
invested significant resources in these efforts. Facebook is presently
investigating apps that had access to large amounts of information
before we changed our platform policies in 2014 to significantly reduce
the data apps could access. To date around 200 apps (from a handful of
developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You, the Cambridge Psychometrics Center,
myPersonality, and AIQ) have been suspended--pending a thorough
investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data.
Additionally, we have suspended an additional 14 apps, which were
installed by around one thousand people. They were all created after
2014, after we made changes to more tightly restrict our platform APIs
to prevent abuse. However, these apps appear to be linked to AIQ, which
was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica. So, we have suspended them
while we investigate further. Any app that refuses to take part in or
fails our audit will be banned.
Chairman Grassley. OK. Right now, you have no certainty of
whether or not--how much of that is going on, right? OK.
Facebook collects massive amounts of data from consumers,
including content, networks, contact lists, device information,
location, and information from third parties, yet your data
policy is only a few pages long and provides consumers with
only a few examples of what is collected and how it might be
used. The examples given emphasize benign uses such as
connecting with friends, but your policy does not give any
indication for more controversial issues of such data.
My question: Why does Facebook not disclose to its users
all the ways the data might be used by Facebook and other third
parties, and what is Facebook's responsibility to inform users
about that information?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Mr. Chairman, I believe it is important to
tell people exactly how the information that they share on
Facebook is going to be used. That is why every single time you
go to share something on Facebook, whether it is a photo in
Facebook or a message in Messenger or WhatsApp, every single
time, there is a control right there about who you are going to
be sharing it with, whether it is your friends or public or a
specific group, and you can change that and control that in
line.
To your broader point about the privacy policy, this gets
into an issue that I think we and others in the tech industry
have found challenging, which is that long privacy policies are
very confusing. And if you make it long and spell out all the
detail, then you are probably going to reduce the percent of
people who read it and make it accessible to them. So one of
the things that we have struggled with over time is to make
something that is as simple as possible so people can
understand it, as well as giving them controls in line in the
product in the context of when they are trying to actually use
them, taking into account that we do not expect that most
people will want to go through and read a full legal document.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Nelson.
Senator Nelson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Yesterday, when we talked, I gave the relatively harmless
example that I am communicating with my friends on Facebook and
indicate that I love a certain kind of chocolate, and all of a
sudden, I start receiving advertisements for chocolate. What if
I do not want to receive those commercial advertisements? So
your Chief Operating Officer, Ms. Sandberg, suggested on the
NBC Today show that Facebook users who do not want their
personal information used for advertising might have to pay for
that protection, pay for it. Are you actually considering
having Facebook users pay for you not to use that information?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, people have a control over how
their information is used in ads in the product today, so if
you want to have an experience where your ads are not targeted
using all the information that we have available, you can turn
off third-party information. What we have found is that even
though some people do not like ads, people really do not like
ads that are not relevant. And while there is some discomfort
for sure with using information in making ads more relevant,
the overwhelming feedback that we get from our community is
that people would rather have us show relevant content there
than not.
So we offer this control that you are referencing. Some
people use it. It is not the majority of people on Facebook.
And I think that that is a good level of control to offer. I
think what Sheryl was saying was that in order to not run ads
at all, we would still need some sort of business model.
Senator Nelson. And that is your business model. And I use
the harmless example of chocolate, but if it got into a more
personal thing, communicating with friends, and I want to cut
it off, I am going to have to pay you in order not to send me,
using my personal information, something that I do not want.
That in essence is what I understood Ms. Sandberg to say. Is
that correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator. Although, to be clear, we do
not offer an option today for people to pay to not show ads. We
think offering an ad-supported service is the most aligned with
our mission of trying to help connect everyone in the world
because we want to offer a free service that everyone can
afford.
Senator Nelson. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg. That is the only way that we can reach
billions of people.
Senator Nelson. So, therefore, you consider my personally
identifiable data the company's data, not my data, is that it?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No, Senator. Actually, the first line of
our terms of service say that you control and own the
information and content that you put on Facebook.
Senator Nelson. Well, the recent scandal is obviously
frustrating not only because it affected 87 million but because
it seems to be part of a pattern of lax data practices by the
company going back years. So back in 2011 it was a settlement
with the FTC and now we discover yet another instance where the
data failed to be protected. When you discovered the Cambridge
Analytica that had fraudulently obtained all this information,
why did you not inform those 87 million?
Mr. Zuckerberg. When we learned in 2015 that Cambridge
Analytica had bought data from an app developer on Facebook
that people had shared it with, we did take action. We took
down the app, and we demanded that both the app developer and
Cambridge Analytica delete and stop using any data that they
had. They told us that they did this. In retrospect, it was
clearly a mistake to believe them.
Senator Nelson. Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg. We should have followed up and done a full
audit then, and that is not a mistake that we will make again.
Senator Nelson. Yes, you did that, and you apologized for
it, but you did not notify them. And do you think that you have
an ethical obligation to notify 87 million Facebook users?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, when we heard back from Cambridge
Analytica that they had told us that they were not using the
data and they had deleted it, we considered it a closed case.
In retrospect, that was clearly a mistake. We should not have
taken their word for it, and we have updated our policies and
how we are going to operate the company to make sure that we do
not make that mistake again.
Senator Nelson. Did anybody notify the FTC?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No, Senator, for the same reason, that we
had considered it a closed case.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Thune.
Chairman Thune. And, Mr. Zuckerberg, would you do that
differently today presumably, in response to Senator Nelson's
question?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Chairman Thune. This may be your first appearance before
Congress, but it is not the first time that Facebook has faced
tough questions about its privacy policies. Wired magazine
recently noted that you have a 14-year history of apologizing
for ill-advised decisions regarding user privacy, not unlike
the one that you made just now in your opening statement. After
more than a decade of promises to do better, how is today's
apology different, and why should we trust Facebook to make the
necessary changes to ensure user privacy and give people a
clearer picture of your privacy policies?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. So we have made a
lot of mistakes in running the company. I think it is pretty
much impossible, I believe, to start a company in your dorm
room and then grow it to be the scale we are at now without
making some mistakes. And because our service is about helping
people connect and information, those mistakes have been
different in how we try not to make the same mistake multiple
times, but in general, a lot of the mistakes are around how
people connect to each other just because of the nature of the
service.
Overall, I would say that we are going through a broader
philosophical shift in how we approach our responsibility as a
company. For the first 10 or 12 years of the company, I viewed
our responsibility as primarily building tools, that if we
could put those tools in people's hands, then that would
empower people to do good things.
What I think we have learned now across a number of issues,
not just data privacy but also fake news and foreign
interference in elections, is that we need to take a more
proactive role and a broader view of our responsibility. It is
not enough to just build tools; we need to make sure that they
are used for good. And that means that we need to now take a
more active view in policing the ecosystem and in watching and
kind of looking out and making sure that all of the members in
our community are using these tools in a way that is going to
be good and healthy.
So, at the end of the day, this is going to be something
where people will measure us by our results on this. It is not
that I expect that anything I say here today to necessarily
change people's view, but I am committed to getting this right,
and I believe that over the coming years, once we fully work
all these solutions through, people will see real differences.
Chairman Thune. OK. I am glad that you all have gotten that
message.
As we discussed in my office yesterday, the line between
legitimate political discourse and hate speech can sometimes be
hard to identify, and especially when you are relying on
artificial intelligence and other technologies for the initial
discovery. Can you discuss the steps that Facebook currently
takes when making these evaluations, the challenges that you
face, and any examples of where you may draw the line between
what is and what is not hate speech?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Mr. Chairman. I will speak to hate
speech, and then I will talk about enforcing our content
policies more broadly. Actually, maybe if you are OK with it, I
will go in the other order.
So, from the beginning of the company in 2004, I started in
my dorm room. It was me and my roommate. We did not have AI
technology that could look at the content that people were
sharing, so we basically had to enforce our content policies
reactively. People could share what they wanted, and then if
someone in the community found it to be offensive or against
our policies, they would flag it for us and we would look at it
reactively.
Now, increasingly, we are developing AI tools that can
identify certain classes of bad activity proactively and flag
it for our team at Facebook. By the end of this year, by the
way, we are going to have more than 20,000 people working on
security and content review working across all these things, so
when content gets flagged to us, we have those people look at
it, and if it violates our policies, then we take it down.
Some problems lend themselves more easily to AI solutions
than others, so hate speech is one of the hardest because
determining if something is hate speech is very linguistically
nuanced, right? You need to understand, you know, what a slur
is and whether something is hateful not just in English, but
the majority of people on Facebook use it in languages that are
different across the world.
Contrast that, for example, with an area like finding
terrorist propaganda, which we have actually been very
successful at deploying AI tools on already. Today, as we sit
here, 99 percent of the ISIS and al-Qaida content that we take
down on Facebook our AI systems flag before any human sees it,
so that is a success in terms of rolling out AI tools that can
proactively police and enforce safety across the community.
Hate speech, I am optimistic that over a 5- to 10-year
period we will have AI tools that can get into some of the
nuances, the linguistic nuances of different types of content
to be more accurate in flagging things for our system, but
today, we are just not there on that. So a lot of this is still
reactive. People flag it to us. We have people look at it. We
have policies to try to make it as not subjective as possible,
but until we get it more automated, there is a higher error
rate than I am happy with.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Feinstein.
Senator Feinstein. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg, what is Facebook doing to prevent foreign
actors from interfering in U.S. elections?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Thank you, Senator. This is one of my top
priorities in 2018 is to get this right. One of my greatest
regrets in running the company is that we were slow in
identifying the Russian information operations in 2016. We
expected them to do a number of more traditional cyber attacks,
which we did identify and notify the campaigns, that they were
trying to hack into them, but we were slow to identifying the
type of new information operations.
Senator Feinstein. When did you identify new operations?
Mr. Zuckerberg. It was right around the time of the 2016
election itself. So since then, we--2018 is an incredibly
important year for elections, not just with the U.S. midterms
but around the world. There are important elections in India,
in Brazil, in Mexico and Pakistan and in Hungary, that we want
to make sure that we do everything we can to protect the
integrity of those elections.
Now, I have more confidence that we are going to get this
right because since the 2016 election, there have been several
important elections around the world where we have had a better
record. There is the French Presidential election, there is the
German election, there was the U.S. Senate Alabama special
election last year.
Senator Feinstein. Explain what is better about the record.
Mr. Zuckerberg. So we have deployed new AI tools that do a
better job of identifying fake accounts that may be trying to
interfere in elections or spread misinformation. And between
those three elections, we were able to proactively remove tens
of thousands of accounts before they could contribute
significant harm. And the nature of these attacks, though, is
that, you know, there are people in Russia whose job it is to
try to exploit our systems and other Internet systems and other
systems as well, so this is an arms race, right? I mean, they
are going to keep getting better at this, and we need to invest
and keep getting better at this, too, which is why one of the
things I mentioned before is we are going to have more than
20,000 people by the end of this year working on security and
content review across the company.
Senator Feinstein. Speak for a moment about automated bots
that spread disinformation. What are you doing to punish those
who exploit your platform in that regard?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, you are not allowed to have a fake
account on Facebook. Your content has to be authentic. So we
build technical tools to try to identify when people are
creating fake accounts, especially large networks of fake
accounts like the Russians have, in order to remove all of that
content.
After the 2016 election, our top priority was protecting
the integrity of other elections around the world, but at the
same time, we had a parallel effort to trace back to Russia the
IRA activity, the Internet Research Agency activity that was
part of the Russian Government that did this activity in 2016.
And just last week, we were able to determine that a number of
Russian media organizations that were sanctioned by the Russian
regulator were operated and controlled by this Internet
Research Agency. So we took the step last week that was a
pretty big step for us of taking down sanctioned news
organizations in Russia as part of an operation to remove 270
fake accounts and pages, part of their broader network in
Russia that was actually not targeting international
interference as much as--I am sorry, let me correct that. It
was primarily targeting spreading misinformation in Russia
itself, as well as certain Russian-speaking neighboring
countries.
Senator Feinstein. How many accounts of this type have you
taken down?
Mr. Zuckerberg. In the IRA specifically, the ones that we
have pegged back to the IRA, we can identify the 470 in the
American elections and the 270 that we specifically went after
in Russia last week. There were many others that our systems
catch, which are more difficult to attribute specifically to
Russian intelligence, but the number would be in the tens of
thousands of fake accounts that we remove, and I am happy to
have my team follow up with you on more information if that
would be helpful.
Senator Feinstein. Would you, please? I think this is very
important.
[The information referred to follows:]
How many accounts of this type [Russian IRA/fake accounts] have you
taken down?
After the 2016 election, we learned from press accounts and
statements by congressional leaders that Russian actors might have
tried to interfere in the election by exploiting Facebook's ad tools.
This is not something we had seen before, and so we started an
investigation. We found that about 470 fake accounts associated with
the IRA spent approximately $100,000 on around 3,500 Facebook and
Instagram ads between June 2015 and August 2017. Our analysis also
showed that these accounts used these ads to promote the roughly 120
Facebook Pages they had set up, which in turn posted more than 80,000
pieces of content between January 2015 and August 2017. More recently,
we took down more than 270 Pages and accounts controlled by the IRA
that primarily targeted either people living in Russia or Russian
speakers around the world, including from countries neighboring Russia.
We are committed to finding and removing fake accounts. We
continually update our technical systems to identify, checkpoint, and
remove inauthentic accounts. We block millions of attempts to register
fake accounts every day. These systems examine thousands of detailed
account attributes and prioritize signals that are more difficult for
bad actors to disguise, such as their connections to others on our
platform. We do not share detailed descriptions of how our tools work
in order to avoid providing a road map to bad actors who are trying to
avoid detection. When we suspect that an account is inauthentic, we
typically enroll the account in a checkpoint that requires the account
holder to provide additional information or verification. We view
disabling an account as a severe sanction, and we want to ensure that
we are highly confident that the account violates our policies before
we take permanent action. When we have confirmed that an account
violates our policies, we remove the account.
Senator Feinstein. If you knew in 2015 that Cambridge
Analytica was using the information of Professor Kogan, why did
Facebook not ban Cambridge in 2015? Why did you wait in other
words?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, that is a great question.
Cambridge Analytica was not using our services in 2015 as far
as we can tell, so this is clearly one of the questions I asked
our team as soon as I learned about this is why did we wait
until we found out about the reports last month to ban them? It
is because, as of the time that we learned about their activity
in 2015, they were not an advertiser, they were not running
pages, so we actually had nothing to ban.
Senator Feinstein. Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Grassley. Yes, thank you, Senator Feinstein.
Now, Senator Hatch.
STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN HATCH,
U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH
Senator Hatch. Well, this is the most intense public
scrutiny I have seen for a tech-related hearing since the
Microsoft hearing that I chaired back in the late 1990s. The
recent stories about Cambridge Analytica and data mining on
social media raise serious concerns about consumer privacy, and
naturally, I know you understand that.
At the same time, these stories touch on the very
foundation of the Internet economy and the way the websites
that drive our Internet economy make money. Some have professed
themselves shocked, shocked that companies like Facebook and
Google share user data with advertisers. Did any of these
individuals ever stop to ask themselves why Facebook and Google
do not charge for access? Nothing in life is free. Everything
involves tradeoffs. If you want something without having to pay
money for it, you are going to have to pay for it in some other
way it seems to me, and that is what we are seeing here.
And these great websites that do not charge for access,
they extract value in some other way, and there is nothing
wrong with that, as long as they are upfront about what they
are doing. In my mind the issue here is transparency. It is
consumer choice. Do users understand what they are agreeing to
when they access the website or agree to terms of service? Are
websites upfront about how they extract value from users, or do
they hide the ball? Do consumers have the information they need
to make an informed choice regarding whether or not to visit a
particular website? To my mind, these are questions that we
should ask or be focusing on.
Now, Mr. Zuckerberg, I remember well your first visit to
Capitol Hill back in 2010. You spoke to the Senate Republican
High-Tech Task Force, which I chair. You said back then that
Facebook would always be free. Is that still your objective?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes. There will always be a
version of Facebook that is free. It is our mission to try to
help connect everyone around the world and to bring the world
closer together. In order to do that, we believe that we need
to offer a service that everyone can afford, and we are
committed to doing that.
Senator Hatch. Well, if so, how do you sustain a business
model in which users do not pay for your service?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we run ads.
Senator Hatch. I see. That is great. Whenever a controversy
like this arises, there is always a danger that Congress'
response will be to step in and overregulate. Now, that has
been the experience that I have had in my 42 years here. In
your view, what sorts of legislative changes would help to
solve the problems the Cambridge Analytica story has revealed,
and what sorts of legislative changes would not help to solve
this issue?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think that there are few
categories of legislation that make sense to consider. Around
privacy specifically, there are few principles that I think it
would be useful to discuss and potentially codify into law. One
is around having a simple and practical set of ways that you
explain what you are doing with data. And we talked a little
bit earlier around the complexity of laying out this long
privacy policy. It is hard to say that people, you know, fully
understand something when it is only written out in a long
legal document. The stuff needs to be implemented in a way
where people can actually understand it, where consumers can
understand it but that can also capture all the nuances of how
these services work in a way that is not overly restrictive on
providing the services. That is one.
The second is around giving people complete control. This
is the most important principle for Facebook. Every piece of
content that you share on Facebook you own, and you have
complete control over who sees it and how you share it. And you
can remove it at any time. That is why every day, about 100
billion times a day, people come to one of our services and
either post a photo or send a message to someone because they
know that they have that control and that who they say it is
going to is who sees the content. And I think that that control
is something that is important that I think should apply to
every service. And----
Senator Hatch. Go ahead.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--the third point is just around enabling
innovation because some of these use cases that are very
sensitive like face recognition, for example--and I think that
there is a balance that is extremely important to strike here
where you obtain special consent for sensitive features like
face recognition, but we still need to make it so that American
companies can innovate in those areas or else we are going to
fall behind Chinese competitors and others around the world who
have different regimes for different new features like that.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Cantwell.
STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL,
U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON
Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Welcome, Mr. Zuckerberg. Do you know who Palantir is?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do.
Senator Cantwell. Some people have referred to them as a
Stanford Analytica. Do you agree?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I have not heard that.
Senator Cantwell. OK. Do you think Palantir taught
Cambridge Analytica--press reports are saying--how to do these
tactics?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not know.
Senator Cantwell. Do you think that Palantir has ever
scraped data from Facebook?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am not aware of that.
Senator Cantwell. OK. Do you think that during the 2016
campaign, as Cambridge Analytica was providing support to the
Trump campaign under Project Alamo, were there any Facebook
people involved in that sharing of technique and information?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we provided support to the Trump
campaign similar to what we provide to any advertiser or
campaign who asks for it.
Senator Cantwell. So that was a yes? Is that a yes?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, can you repeat the specific
question? I just want to make sure I get----
Senator Cantwell. Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--specifically what you are asking.
Senator Cantwell. During the 2016 campaign, Cambridge
Analytica worked with the Trump campaign to refine tactics, and
were Facebook employees involved in that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not know that our employees
were involved with Cambridge Analytica, although I know that we
did help out with the Trump campaign overall in sales support
in the same way that we do with other campaigns.
Senator Cantwell. So they may have been involved and all
working together during that time period? Maybe that is
something your investigation will find out?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I can certainly have my team get
back to you on any specifics there that I do not know sitting
here today.
Senator Cantwell. Have you heard of Total Information
Awareness? Do you know what I am talking about?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No, I do not.
Senator Cantwell. OK. Total Information Awareness was 2003,
John Ashcroft and others trying to do similar things to what I
think is behind all of this, geopolitical forces trying to get
data and information to influence a process. So when I look at
Palantir and what they are doing and I look at WhatsApp, which
is another acquisition, and I look at where you are from the
2011 Consent Decree and where you are today, I am thinking is
this guy outfoxing the foxes, or is he going along with what is
a major trend in an information age to try to harvest
information for political forces?
And so my question to you is do you see that those
applications, that those companies Palantir and even WhatsApp
are going to fall into the same situation that you have just
fallen into over the last several years?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am not sure specifically.
Overall, I do think that these issues around information access
are challenging. To the specifics about those apps, I am not
really that familiar with what Palantir does. WhatsApp collects
very little information and I think is less likely to have the
kind of issues because of the way that the service is
architected, but certainly, I think that these are broad issues
across the tech industry.
Senator Cantwell. Well, I guess, given the track record
where Facebook is and why you are here today, I guess people
would say that they did not act boldly enough. And the fact
that people like John Bolton basically was an investor--in a
New York Times article earlier--I guess it was actually last
month that the Bolton PAC was obsessed with how America was
becoming limp-wristed and spineless and it wanted research and
messaging for national security issues.
So the fact that, you know, there are a lot of people who
are interested in this larger effort, and what I think my
constituents want to know is was this discussed at your Board
meetings, and what are the applications and interests that are
being discussed without putting real teeth into this? We do not
want to come back to this situation again. I believe you have
all the talent. My question is whether you have all the will to
help us solve this problem?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator. So data privacy and foreign
interference in elections are certainly topics that we have
discussed at the Board meeting. These are some of the biggest
issues that the company has faced, and we feel a huge
responsibility to get these right.
Senator Cantwell. Do you believe the European regulations
should be applied here in the U.S.?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think everyone in the world
deserves good privacy protection, and regardless of whether we
implement the exact same regulation--I would guess that it
would be somewhat different because we have somewhat different
sensibilities in the U.S. as to other countries--we are
committed to rolling out the controls and the affirmative
consent and the special controls around sensitive types of
technology like face recognition that are required in GDP are.
We are doing that around the world. So I think it is certainly
worth discussing whether we should have something similar in
the U.S., but what I would like to say today is that we are
going to go forward and implement that, regardless of what the
regulatory outcome is.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Wicker. Senator Thune will chair
next. Senator Wicker.
STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER WICKER,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI
Senator Wicker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And, Mr. Zuckerberg, thank you for being with us. My
question is going to be sort of a follow-up on what Senator
Hatch was talking about. And let me agree with his advice that
we do not want to overregulate to the point where we are
stifling innovation and investment.
I understand with regard to suggested rules or suggested
legislation for internet privacy there are at least two schools
of thought out there. One would be the ISPs, the internet
service providers, who are advocating for privacy protections
for consumers that apply to all online entities equally across
the entire Internet ecosystem. Now, Facebook is an edge
provider on the other hand. It is my understanding that many
edge providers such as Facebook may not support that effort
because edge providers have different business models than the
ISPs and should not be considered like services.
So do you think we need consistent privacy protections for
consumers across the entire Internet ecosystem that are based
on the type of consumer information being collected, used, or
shared, regardless of the entity doing the collecting, using,
or sharing?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, this is an important question. I
would differentiate between ISPs, which I consider to be the
pipes of the internet, and the platforms like Facebook or
Google or Twitter, YouTube that are the apps or platforms on
top of that. I think in general, the expectations that people
have of the pipes are somewhat different from the platforms, so
there might be areas where there needs to be more regulation in
one and less on the other, but then I think there are going to
be other places where there needs to be more regulation of the
other type.
Specifically, though, on the pipes, one of the important
issues that I think we face and have debated is----
Senator Wicker. When you say pipes, you mean?
Mr. Zuckerberg. ISPs.
Senator Wicker. The ISPs.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes. And I know net neutrality has been a
hotly debated topic, and one of the reasons why I have been out
there saying that I think that that should be the case is
because, you know, I look at my own story of when I was getting
started building Facebook at Harvard, you know, I only had one
option for an ISP to use, and if I had to pay extra in order to
make it so that my app could potentially be seen or used by
other people, then we probably would not be here today.
Senator Wicker. OK, but we are talking about privacy
concerns. And let me just say we will have to follow up on
this, but I think you and I agree this is going to be one of
the major items of debate if we have to go forward and address
internet privacy from a governmental standpoint.
Let me move on to another couple of items. Is it true, as
was recently publicized, that Facebook collects the call and
text histories of its users that use android phones?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we have an app called Messenger
for sending messages to your Facebook friends, and that app
offers people an option to sync their text messages into the
messaging app and to make it so that--basically, so you can
have one app where it has both your texts and your Facebook
messages in one place. We also allow people the option----
Senator Wicker. You can opt in or out of that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Wicker. Is it easy to opt out?
Mr. Zuckerberg. It is opt-in. You have to affirmatively say
that you want to sync that information before we get access to
it.
Senator Wicker. Unless you opt in, you do not collect that
call and text history?
Mr. Zuckerberg. That is correct.
Senator Wicker. And is this practice done at all with
minors or do you make an exception there for persons aged 13 to
17?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do not know. We can follow up on that.
Senator Wicker. OK. Do that. And let us know.
[The information referred to follows:]
Does Facebook allow minors (13-17) to opt in to share their call
and text history?
Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature that
lets people import contact information to help them connect with people
they know on Facebook and Messenger. We introduced the call and text
history component of this feature for Android users several years ago,
and currently offer it in Messenger and Facebook Lite, a lightweight
version of Facebook, on Android.
We've reviewed this feature to confirm that Facebook does not
collect the content of messages--and will delete all logs older than
one year. In the future, the client will only upload to our servers the
information needed to offer this feature--not broader data such as the
time of calls. We do allow people from 13 to 17 to opt into this
service. However, we do take other steps to protect teens on Facebook
and Messenger:
We provide education before allowing teens to post publicly.
We don't show search results based on specific profile data
(high school, birthday/age, and hometown, or current city) of
teens to unconnected adults when the adults search on Facebook.
Unconnected adults can't message minors who are 13-17.
We have age limits for advertisements. For example, ads for
dating sites, financial services and other products or services
are gated to users under 18.
We've also helped many teenagers with information about
bullying prevention campaigns and online safety tips.
Senator Wicker. And one other thing. There have been
reports that Facebook can track a user's Internet browsing
activity even after that user has logged off of the Facebook
platform. Can you confirm whether or not this is true?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I want to make sure I get this
accurate so it would probably be better to have my team follow
up afterwards.
Senator Wicker. So you do not know?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I know that people use cookies on the
internet and that you can probably correlate activity between
sessions. We do that for a number of reasons, including
security and including measuring ads to make sure that the ad
experiences are the most effective, which, of course, people
can opt out of. But I want to make sure that I am precise in my
answer so----
Senator Wicker. Well, when you get----
Mr. Zuckerberg. --let me follow up with you after.
Senator Wicker.--back to me, sir, would you also let us
know how Facebook discloses to its users that it is engaging in
this type of tracking, if Facebook is in fact tracking users
after they have logged off the platform?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
[The information referred to follows:]
There have been reports that Facebook can track users' Internet
browsing activity even after that user has logged off of the Facebook
platform. Can you confirm whether or not this is true? Would you also
let us know how Facebook discloses to its users that engaging in this
type of tracking gives us that result of tracking between devices?
When people visit apps or websites that feature our technologies--
like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers automatically log
(i) standard browser or app records of the fact that a particular
device or user visited the website or app (this connection to
Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a website
or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button, and is an
inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any additional
information the publisher of the app or website chooses to share with
Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as the fact
that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard feature of
the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same information
with multiple different third-parties whenever people visit their
website or app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's website
shares information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick and with
the analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a person visits
the Committee's website, it sends browser information about their visit
to each one of those third parties. More information about how this
works is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-
facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for this
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us--
described above--in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First,
these logs are critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to
detecting or preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser
has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign
the device might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a
potentially inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to
register for an account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide
summaries and insights to websites and apps about how many people visit
or use their product or use specific features like our Like button--but
without providing any information about a specific person. We do not
create profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use browser and app
logs for non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from our advertisers
to them or otherwise seek to personalize the content they see. However,
we may take the opportunity to show a general ad that is unrelated to
the attributes of the person or an ad encouraging the non-user to sign
up for Facebook.
When the individual is a Facebook user, we are also able to use
this information to personalize their experiences on Facebook, whether
or not they are logged out, but we will not target ads to users relying
on this information unless the user allows this in their privacy
settings. We do not sell or share this information with third-parties.
Senator Wicker. And thank you very much.
Chairman Thune [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Wicker.
Senator Leahy is up next.
STATEMENT OF HON. PATRICK LEAHY,
U.S. SENATOR FROM VERMONT
Senator Leahy. Thank you.
Mr. Zuckerberg, I assume Facebook has been served subpoenas
from Special Counsel Mueller's office. Is that correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Leahy. Have you or anyone at Facebook been
interviewed by the Special Counsel's office?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Leahy. Have you been interviewed?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I have not. I have not.
Senator Leahy. Others have?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I believe so. And I want to be careful here
because our work with the Special Counsel is confidential, and
I want to make sure that in an open session I am not revealing
something that is confidential.
Senator Leahy. I understand. I just want to make clear that
you have been contacted, and you have had subpoenas.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Actually, let me clarify that. I actually
am not aware of a subpoena. I believe that there may be, but I
know we are working with them.
Senator Leahy. Thank you. Six months ago, your General
Counsel promised us that you were taking steps to prevent
Facebook from serving, as it is called, as an unwitting co-
conspirator in Russian interference. But these unverified
divisive pages are on Facebook today. They look a lot like the
anonymous groups the Russian agencies used to spread propaganda
during the 2016 election. Are you able to confirm whether they
are Russian-created groups? Yes or no?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, are you asking about those
specifically?
Senator Leahy. Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, last week, we actually announced a
major change to our ads-and-pages policies that we will be
verifying the identity of every single----
Senator Leahy. I am asking about----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--advertiser----
Senator Leahy.--specific ones. Do you know whether they
are?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I am not familiar with those pieces of
content specifically.
Senator Leahy. But if you decided this policy a week ago,
you would be able to verify them?
Mr. Zuckerberg. We are working on that now. What we are
doing is we are going to verify the identity of any advertiser
who is running a political- or issue-related ad. This is
basically what the Honest Ads Act is proposing, and we are
following that, and we are also going to do that for pages so--
--
Senator Leahy. But you cannot answer on these?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I am not familiar with those specific
cases.
Senator Leahy. Will you find out the answer and get back to
me?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I will have my team get back to you.
[The information referred to follows:]
Six months ago, your general counsel promised us you were taking
steps to prevent Facebook from serving what I call unwitting conspiracy
Russian interference. But these unverified, divisive pages are on
Facebook today. They look a lot like Russian agents used to spread
propaganda during the 2016 election. Are you able to confirm whether
they are Russian groups, yes or no?
In general, we take aggressive investigative steps to identify and
disable groups that conduct coordinated inauthentic activities on the
platform, but it is extremely challenging to definitively attribute
online activity to particular threat actors. We often rely on
information from others, like information from the government, to
identify actors behind abuse that we observe and to better understand
these issues. We would need more information in order to review the
specific Pages referenced at the hearing.
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do think it is worth adding, though, that
we are going to do the same verification of the identity and
location of admins who are running large pages, so that way
even if they are not going to be buying ads on our system, that
will make it significantly harder for Russian interference
efforts or other inauthentic efforts----
Senator Leahy. Well, some----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--to try to spread information through the
network.
Senator Leahy. And it has been going on for some time, so
you might say that it is about time. You know, six months ago,
I asked your general counsel about Facebook's role as a
breeding ground for hate speech against Rohingya refugees.
Recently, U.N. investigators blamed Facebook for playing a role
in inciting the possible genocide in Myanmar, and there has
been genocide there. Now, you say you used AI to find this.
This is the type of content I am referring to. It calls for the
death of a Muslim journalist. Now, that threat went straight
through your detection system, it spread very quickly, and
then, it took attempt after attempt after attempt and the
involvement of civil society groups to get you to remove it.
Why could it not be removed within 24 hours?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, what is happening in Myanmar is a
terrible tragedy, and we need to do more.
Senator Leahy. We all agree with that.
Mr. Zuckerberg. OK.
Senator Leahy. But U.N. investigators have blamed you,
blamed Facebook for playing a role in the genocide. We all
agree it is terrible. How can you dedicate and will you
dedicate resources to make sure such hate speech is taken down
within 24 hours?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, we are working on this. And there are
three specific things that we are doing. One is we are hiring
dozens of more Burmese language content reviewers because hate
speech is very language-specific. It is hard to do it without
people who speak the local language, and we need to ramp up our
effort there dramatically.
Second is we are working with civil society in Myanmar to
identify specific hate figures so we can take down their
accounts rather than specific pieces of content.
And third is we are standing up a product team to do
specific product changes in Myanmar and other countries that
may have similar issues in the future to prevent this from
happening.
Senator Leahy. Senator Cruz and I sent a letter to Apple
asking what they are going to do about Chinese censorship. My
question, I will place it for the record.
Chairman Thune. That would be great. Thank you, Senator
Leahy.
Senator Leahy. At least for the record I want to know what
you will do about Chinese censorship when they come to you.
[The information referred to follows:]
I want to know what you'll do about Chinese censorship when they
come to you.
Because Facebook has been blocked in China since 2009, we are not
in a position to know exactly how the government would seek to apply
its laws and regulations on content were we permitted to offer our
service to Chinese users. Since 2013, Facebook has been a member of the
Global Network Initiative (GNI), a multi-stakeholder digital rights
initiative. As part of our membership, Facebook has committed to the
freedom of expression and privacy standards set out in the GNI
Principles--which are in turn based on the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights--and we are independently assessed on our compliance with
these standards on a biennial basis.
When something on Facebook or Instagram is reported to us as
violating local law, but doesn't go against our Community Standards, we
may restrict the content's availability only in the country where it is
alleged to be illegal after careful legal review. We receive reports
from governments and courts, as well from non-government entities such
as members of the Facebook community and NGOs.
More information is available here: https://
transparency.facebook.com/content-restrictions.
Chairman Thune. Senator Graham is up next.
STATEMENT OF HON. LINDSEY GRAHAM,
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH CAROLINA
Senator Graham. Thank you.
Are you familiar with Andrew Bosworth?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator, I am.
Senator Graham. He said, ``So we connect more people, maybe
someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools.
The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so
deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more
often is de facto good.'' Do you agree with that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No, Senator, I do not, and as context, Bos
wrote that--Bos is what we call him internally--he wrote that
as an internal note. We had a lot of discussion internally. I
disagreed with it at the time that he wrote it. If you looked
at the comments on the internal discussion, the vast majority--
--
Senator Graham. Would you say----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--of people internally did, too.
Senator Graham.--that you did a poor job as a CEO
communicating your displeasure with such thoughts because if he
had understood where you were, he never would have said it to
begin with?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, we try to run our company in
a way where people can express different opinions internally.
Senator Graham. Well, this is an opinion that really
disturbs me. And if somebody worked for me that said this, I
would fire them.
Who is your biggest competitor?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we have a lot of competitors.
Senator Graham. Who is your biggest?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I think the categories of--did you want
just one? I am not sure I can give one, but can I give a bunch?
Senator Graham. Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg. So there are three categories I would focus
on. One are the other tech platforms so Google, Apple, Amazon,
Microsoft. We overlap with them in different ways.
Senator Graham. Do they provide the same service you
provide?
Mr. Zuckerberg. In different ways, different parts of it,
yes.
Senator Graham. Let me put it this way. If I buy a Ford and
it does not work well and I do not like it, I can buy a Chevy.
If I am upset with Facebook, what is the equivalent product
that I can go sign up for?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, the second category that I was going
to talk about are specific----
Senator Graham. I am not talking about categories. I am
talking about is there real competition you face? Because car
companies face a lot of competition. If they make a defective
car, it gets out in the world, people stop buying that car or
they buy another one. Is there an alternative to Facebook in
the private sector?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator. The average American uses
eight different apps----
Senator Graham. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--to communicate with their friends and stay
in touch with people----
Senator Graham. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--ranging from texting apps----
Senator Graham. Which is the----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--to e-mail to----
Senator Graham.--same service you provide? Is----
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, we provide a number of different
services.
Senator Graham. Is Twitter the same as what you do?
Mr. Zuckerberg. It overlaps with a portion of what we do.
Senator Graham. You do not think you have a monopoly?
Mr. Zuckerberg. It certainly does not feel like that to me.
[Laughter.]
Senator Graham. OK. So it does not. So Instagram, you
bought Instagram. Why did you buy Instagram?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Because they were very talented app
developers who were making good use of our platform and
understood our values.
Senator Graham. It was a good business decision. My point
is that one way to regulate a company is through competition,
through government regulation. Here is the question that all of
us got an answer. What we tell our constituents, given what has
happened here, why we should let you self-regulate? What would
you tell people in South Carolina that, given all the things we
have just discovered here, it is a good idea for us to rely
upon you to regulate your own business practices?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, my position is not that
there should be no regulation.
Senator Graham. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg. I think the Internet has increased the
importance----
Senator Graham. Do you embrace regulation?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I think the real question, as the internet
becomes more important in people's lives, is what is the right
regulation, not whether there should be regulation.
Senator Graham. But you as a company welcome regulation?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I think if it is the right regulation, then
yes.
Senator Graham. Do you think the Europeans have it right?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I think that they get things right.
Senator Graham. Have you ever submitted----
[Laughter.]
Senator Graham. That is true. So would you work with us in
terms of what regulations you think are necessary in your
industry?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Absolutely.
Senator Graham. OK. Would you submit to us some proposed
regulations?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, and I will have my team follow up with
you, so that way we can have this discussion across the
different categories where I think that this discussion needs
to happen.
Senator Graham. I look forward to it.
[The information referred to follows:]
Would you submit to us some proposed regulations?
Facebook is generally not opposed to regulation but wants to ensure
it is the right regulation. The issues facing the industry are complex,
multi-faceted, and affect an important part of peoples' lives. As such,
Facebook is absolutely committed to working with regulators, like
Congress, to craft the right regulations. Facebook would be happy to
review any proposed legislation and provide comments.
Senator Graham. When you sign up for Facebook, you sign up
for terms of service. Are you familiar with that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Graham. OK. It says, ``The terms govern your use of
Facebook and the products, features, apps, services,
technologies, software we offer (the Facebook products or
products), except where we expressly state that separate terms
(and not these) apply.'' I am a lawyer and I have no idea what
that means. But when you look at terms of service, this is what
you get. Do you think the average consumer understands what
they are signing up for?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do not think that the average person
likely reads that whole document.
Senator Graham. Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg. But I think that there are different ways
that we can communicate that and have a responsibility to do
so.
Senator Graham. Do you agree with me that you better come
up with different ways because this is not working?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, I think in certain areas
that is true, and I think in other areas like the core part of
what we do--right, if you think about just at the most basic
level, people come to Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger
about 100 billion times a day to share a piece of content or a
message with a specific set of people. And I think that that
basic functionality people understand because we have the
controls in line every time. And given the volume of the
activity and the value that people tell us that they are
getting from that, I think that that control in line does seem
to be working fairly well.
Now, we can always do better, and there are other services
that are complex and there is more to it than just, you know,
you go and you push the photo, so I agree that in many places
we could do better. But I think for the core of the service, it
actually is quite clear.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Graham.
Senator Klobuchar.
STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA
Senator Klobuchar. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg, I think we all agree that what happened
here was bad. You acknowledged it was a breach of trust. And
the way I explained it to my constituents is that if someone
breaks into my apartment with a crowbar and they take my stuff,
it is just like if the manager gave them the keys or if they
did not have any locks on the doors. It is still a breach. It
is still a break-in. And I believe we need to have laws and
rules that are as sophisticated as the brilliant products that
you have developed here, and we just have not done that yet.
And one of the areas that I have focused on is the
election, and I appreciate the support that you and Facebook
and now Twitter actually have given to the Honest Ads Act, a
bill that you mentioned that I am leading with Senator McCain
and Senator Warner. And I just want to be clear, as we work to
pass this law so that we have the same rules in place to
disclose political ads and issue ads as we do for TV and radio,
as well as disclaimers, that you are going to take early
action--as soon as June I heard--before this election so that
people can view these ads, including issue ads, is that
correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. That is correct, Senator, and I just want
to take a moment before I go into this in more detail to thank
you for your leadership on this. This I think is an important
area for the whole industry to move on.
The two specific things that we are doing are, one is
around transparency, so now, you are going to be able to go and
click on any advertiser or any page on Facebook and see all of
the ads that they are running, so that actually brings
advertising online on Facebook to an even higher standard than
what you would have on TV or print media because there is
nowhere where you can see all of the TV ads that someone is
running, for example, where as you will be able to see now on
Facebook whether this campaign or third party is saying
different messages to different types of people. And I think
that is a really important element of transparency. And the
other really important piece is around verifying every single
advertiser who is going to be running political or issue ads.
Senator Klobuchar. I appreciate that. And Senator Warner
and I have also called on Google and the other platforms to do
the same, so memo to the rest of you, we have to get this done
or we are going to have a patchwork of ads. And I hope that you
will be working with us to pass this bill. Is that right?
Mr. Zuckerberg. We will.
Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you.
Now, on the subject of Cambridge Analytica, were these
people, the 87 million people, users, concentrated in certain
states? Are you able to figure out where they are from?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do not have that information with me----
Senator Klobuchar. But you could get it?
Mr. Zuckerberg.--but we can follow up with your office.
Senator Klobuchar. OK. Because, as we know, the election
was close, and it was only thousands of votes in certain
states.
You have also estimated that roughly 126 million people may
have been shown content from a Facebook page associated with
the Internet Research Agency. Have you determined whether any
of those people were the same Facebook users whose data was
shared with Cambridge Analytica? Are you able to make that
determination?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we are investigating that now. We
believe that it is entirely possible that there will be a
connection there.
Senator Klobuchar. OK. That seems like a big deal as we
look back at that last election.
Former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wiley has
said that the data that it improperly obtained, that Cambridge
Analytica improperly obtained from Facebook users could be
stored in Russia. Do you agree that that is a possibility?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Sorry, are you asking if Cambridge
Analytica's data could be stored in Russia?
Senator Klobuchar. That is what he said this weekend on a
Sunday show.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not have any specific
knowledge that would suggest that, but one of the steps that we
need to take now is go do a full audit of all of Cambridge
Analytica's systems, understand what they are doing, whether
they still have any data, to make sure that they remove all the
data. If they do not, we are going to take legal action against
them to do so.
That audit we have temporarily ceded that in order to let
the U.K. Government complete their government investigation
first because of course a government investigation takes
precedence over a company doing that. But we are committed to
completing this full audit and getting to the bottom of what is
going on here so that way we can have more answers to this.
Senator Klobuchar. OK. You earlier stated publicly and here
that you would support some privacy rules so that everyone is
playing by the same rules here. And you also said here that you
should have notified customers earlier. Would you support a
rule that would require you to notify your users of a breach
within 72 hours?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, that makes sense to me, and I
think we should have our team follow up with yours to discuss
the details around that more.
[The information referred to follows:]
Can you provide a breakdown of users affected by Cambridge
Analytica by state?
See the state breakdown here: https://
fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/state-by-state-breakdown.pdf.
Do you support a rule that would require you to notify your users
of a breach within 72 hours?
Facebook is generally open to the idea of breach notification
requirements, particularly legislation that would centralize reporting
and ensure a consistent approach across the United States. For example,
in Europe, the GDPR requires notification to a lead supervisory
authority, rather than individual member states, in cases of a data
breach. In the United States, however, there is no centralized
notification scheme, and instead, reporting obligations vary widely
across all 50 states. This complexity makes it harder to respond
appropriately and swiftly to protect people in the event of a data
breach. We believe this is an important issue and an area that is ripe
for thoughtful regulation.
Senator Klobuchar. Thank you. I just think part of this was
when people do not even know that their data has been breached,
that is a huge problem, and I also think we get to solutions
faster when we get that information out there.
Thank you, and we look forward to passing this bill. We
would love to pass it before the election on the Honest Ads and
looking forward to better disclosure this election. Thank you.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Klobuchar.
Senator Blunt is up next.
STATEMENT OF HON. ROY BLUNT,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSOURI
Senator Blunt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg, nice to see you. I saw you not too long
after I entered the Senate in 2011. I told you when I sent my
business cards down to be printed, they came back from the
Senate printshop with the message that they were the first
business card they had ever printed a Facebook address on.
There are days when I have regretted that but more days when we
get lots of information that we need to get. There are days
when I wonder if the term ``Facebook friends'' is a little
misstated. It does not seem like I have those every single day.
But, you know, the platform you have created is really
important.
Now, my son Charlie, who is 13, is dedicated to Instagram,
so he would want to be sure I mentioned him while I was here
with you.
[Laughter.]
Senator Blunt. I have not printed that on my card yet, I
will say that, but I think we have that account as well. A lot
of ways to connect people. And the information obviously is an
important commodity, and it is what makes your business work. I
get that. However, I wonder about some of the collection
efforts, and maybe we can go through largely just even yes or
no and then we will get back to more expansive discussion of
this.
But do you collect user data through cross-device tracking?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I believe we do link people's
accounts between devices in order to make sure that their
Facebook and Instagram and their other experiences can be
synced between their devices.
Senator Blunt. And that would also include off-line data,
data that is tracking that is not necessarily linked to
Facebook but linked to some device they went through Facebook
on, is that right?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I want to make sure we get this
right, so I want to have my team follow up with you on that
afterwards.
Senator Blunt. Well, now, that does not seem that
complicated to me. Now, you understand this better than I do,
but maybe you can explain to me why that is complicated. Do you
track devices that an individual who uses Facebook has that is
connected to the device that they use for their Facebook
connection but not necessarily connected to Facebook?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I am not sure the answer to that question.
Senator Blunt. Really?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes. There may be some data that is
necessary to provide the service that we do, but I do not have
that sitting here today, so that is something I would want to
follow up with you on.
[The information referred to follows:]
Do you track non-Facebook data from devices on which they have used
Facebook, even if they are logged off of Facebook or the device is
offline? So you don't have bundled permissions for how I can agree to
what devices I may use that you may have contact with? Do you bundle
that permission, or am I able to individually say what I'm willing for
you to watch and what I don't want you to watch?
When people visit apps or websites that feature our technologies--
like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers automatically log
(i) standard browser or app records of the fact that a particular
device or user visited the website or app (this connection to
Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a website
or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button, and is an
inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any additional
information the publisher of the app or website chooses to share with
Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as the fact
that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard feature of
the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same information
with multiple different third-parties whenever people visit their
website or app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's website
shares information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick and with
the analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a person visits
the Committee's website, it sends browser information about their visit
to each one of those third parties. More information about how this
works is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-
facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for this
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us--
described above--in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First,
these logs are critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to
detecting or preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser
has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign
the device might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a
potentially inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to
register for an account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide
summaries and insights to websites and apps about how many people visit
or use their product or use specific features like our Like button--but
without providing any information about a specific person. We do not
create profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use browser and app
logs for non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from our advertisers
to them or otherwise seek to personalize the content they see. However,
we may take the opportunity to show a general ad that is unrelated to
the attributes of the person or an ad encouraging the non-user to sign
up for Facebook.
When the individual is a Facebook user, we are also able to use
this information to personalize their experiences on Facebook, whether
or not they are logged out, but we will not target ads to users relying
on this information unless the user allows this in their privacy
settings. We do not sell or share this information with third-parties.
Senator Blunt. Now, the FTC last year flagged cross-device
tracking as one of their concerns generally that people are
tracking devices that the users of something like Facebook do
not know they are being tracked. How do you disclose your
collection methods? Is that all in this document that I would
see and agree to before I entered into a Facebook partnership?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator. So there are two ways that we
do this. One is we try to be exhaustive in the legal documents
around the terms of service and privacy policies. But more
importantly, we try to provide in-line controls that are in
plain English that people can understand. They can either go to
settings or we can show them at the top of the app periodically
so that people understand all the controls and settings they
have and can configure their experience the way that they want.
Senator Blunt. So do people now give you permission to
track specific devices in their contract? And if they do, is
that a relatively new addition to what you do?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am sorry I do not have the----
Senator Blunt. Am I able to opt out? Am I able to say it is
OK for you to track what I am saying on Facebook, but I do not
want you to track what I am texting to somebody else off
Facebook on an android phone?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Oh, OK. Yes, Senator. In general, Facebook
is not collecting data from other apps that you use. There may
be some specific things about the device that you are using
that Facebook needs to understand in order to offer the
service, but if you are using Google or you are using some
texting app, unless you specifically opt in that you want to
share the texting app information, Facebook would not see that.
Senator Blunt. Has it always been that way or is that a
recent addition to how you deal with those other ways that I
might communicate?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, my understanding is that that is
how the mobile operating systems are architected.
Senator Blunt. So you do not have bundled permissions for
how I can agree to what devices I may use that you may have
contact with? Do you bundle that permission or am I able to
individually say what I am willing for you to watch and what I
do not want you to watch? I think we may have to take that for
the record based on everybody else's time.
[The information referred to follows:]
Do you track devices that an individual who uses Facebook has that
is connected to the device that they use for their Facebook connection
but not necessarily connected to Facebook?
Yes, Facebook's Data Policy specifically discloses that we
associate information across different devices that people use to
provide a consistent experience wherever they use Facebook.
Facebook's services inherently operate on a cross-device basis:
understanding when people use our services across multiple devices
helps us provide the same personalized experience wherever people use
Facebook--for example, to ensure that a person's News Feed or profile
contains the same content whether they access our services on their
mobile phone or in a desktop computer's web browser.
In support of those and other purposes, we collect information from
and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected
devices our users use that integrate with our Products, and we combine
this information across a user's different devices. For example, we use
information collected about a person's use of our Products on their
phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or features
they see when they use our Products on another device, such as their
laptop or tablet, or to measure whether they took an action in response
to an ad we showed them on their phone or on a different device.
Information we obtain from these devices includes:
Device attributes: information such as the operating system,
hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength,
available storage space, browser type, app and file names and
types, and plugins.
Device operations: information about operations and
behaviors performed on the device, such as whether a window is
foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can
help distinguish humans from bots).
Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other
identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts people use,
and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to Facebook
Company Products associated with the same device or account).
Device signals: Bluetooth signals, and information about
nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers.
Data from device settings: information a user allows us to
receive through device settings they turn on, such as access to
their GPS location, camera or photos.
Network and connections: information such as the name of a
user's mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile
phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases,
information about other devices that are nearby or on their
network, so we can do things like help them stream a video from
their phone to their TV.
Cookie data: data from cookies stored on a user's device,
including cookie IDs and settings. More information is
available at https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/ and
https://help.instagram.com/1896641480634370?ref=ig.
Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information
through Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins
(such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the
Facebook pixel. These partners provide information about a person's
activities off Facebook--including information about their device,
websites they visit, purchases they make, the ads they see, and how
they use their services--whether or not they have a Facebook account or
are logged into Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our
API to tell us what games a person plays, or a business could tell us
about a purchase a person made in its store. We also receive
information about a person's online and offline actions and purchases
from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide us with
that person's information.
We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including
to personalize features and content (including a person's News Feed,
Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories and ads) and make suggestions for a
user (such as groups or events they may be interested in or topics they
may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized
Products that are unique and relevant to them, we use their
connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data we
collect and learn from them and others (including any data with special
protections they choose to provide); how they use and interact with our
Products; and the people, places, or things they're connected to and
interested in on and off our Products.
For example, if people have shared their device locations with
Facebook or checked into a specific restaurant, we can show them ads
from an advertiser that wants to promote its services in their area or
from the restaurant. We use location-related information--such as a
person's current location, where they live, the places they like to go,
and the businesses and people they're near--to provide, personalize and
improve our Products, including ads, for them and others. Location-
related information can be based on things like precise device location
(if a user has allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information
from their and others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or
events they attend). We store data until it is no longer necessary to
provide our services and Facebook Products, or until a person's account
is deleted--whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination
that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected
and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. We
provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their
ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information
that personally identifies someone (information such as a person's name
or e-mail address that by itself can be used to contact them or
identifies who they are) unless they give us permission. For example,
we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers
(for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and
34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them
better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads
led users to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Blunt.
Next up, Senator Durbin.
STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD DURBIN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM ILLINOIS
Senator Durbin. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us
the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No.
[Laughter.]
Senator Durbin. If you messaged anybody this week, would
you share with us the names of the people you have messaged?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, no. I would probably not choose to
do that publicly here.
Senator Durbin. I think that may be what this is all about,
your right to privacy, the limits of your right to privacy, and
how much you give away in modern America in the name of, quote,
``connecting people around the world,'' a question basically of
what information Facebook is collecting, who they are sending
it to, and whether they ever asked me in advance my permission
to do that. Is that a fair thing for a user of Facebook to
expect?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator. I think everyone should have
control over how their information is used. And as we have
talked about in some of the other questions, I think that that
is laid out in some of the documents, but more importantly, you
want to give people control in the product itself. So the most
import way that this happens across our services is that every
day people come to our services to choose to share photos or
send messages, and every single time they choose to share
something, they have a control right there about who they want
to share it with. But that----
Senator Durbin. They certainly----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--level of control is extremely important.
Senator Durbin. They certainly know within the Facebook
pages who their friends are, but they may not know, as has
happened--and you have conceded this point in the past--that
sometimes that information is going way beyond their friends,
and sometimes, people have made money off of sharing that
information, correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, you are referring I think to our
developer platform, and it may be useful for me to give some
background on how we set that up if that is useful.
Senator Durbin. I have 3 minutes left, so maybe you can do
that for the record because I have a couple other questions
that I would like to ask.
[The information referred to follows:]
They certainly know within the Facebook pages who their friends
are, but they may not know, as has happened, and you've conceded this
point in the past, that sometimes that information is going way beyond
their friends and sometimes people have made money off of sharing that
information, correct?
Our Download Your Information or ``DYI'' tool is Facebook's data
portability tool and was launched many years ago to let people access
and download many types of information that we maintain about them. The
data in DYI and in our Ads Preferences tool contain each of the
interest categories that are used to show people ads, along with
information about the advertisers are currently running ads based on
their use of an advertiser's website or app. People also can choose not
to see ads from those advertisers. We recently announced expansions to
Download Your Information, which, among other things, will make it
easier for people to see their data, delete it, and easily download and
export it. More information is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/
news/2018/04/new-privacy-protections.
Responding to feedback that we should do more to provide
information about websites and apps that send us information when
people use them, we also announced plans to build Clear History. This
new feature will enable users to see the websites and apps that send us
information when they use them, delete this information from their
account, and turn off Facebook's ability to store it associated with
their account going forward.
We have also introduced Access Your Information. This feature
provides a new way for people to access and manage their information.
Users can go here to delete anything from their timeline or profile
that they no longer want on Facebook. They can also see their ad
interests, as well as information about ads they've clicked on and
advertisers who have provided us with information about them that
influence the ads they see. From here, they can go to their ad settings
to manage how this data is used to show them ads.
Facebook allows people to view, manage, and remove the apps that
they have logged into with Facebook through the App Dashboard. We
recently prompted everyone to review their App Dashboard as a part of a
Privacy Checkup, and we also provided an educational notice on Facebook
to encourage people to review their settings. More information about
how users can manage their app settings is available at https://
www.facebook.com/help/218345114850283?helpref=about_content.
The categories of information that an app can access are clearly
disclosed before the user consents to use an app on the Facebook
Platform. Users can view and edit the categories of information that
apps they have used have access to through the App Dashboard.
Senator Durbin. You have recently announced something that
is called Messenger Kids. Facebook created an app allowing kids
between the ages of 6 and 12 to send video and text messages
through Facebook as an extension of their parent's account.
They have cartoon-like stickers and other features designed to
appeal to little kids, first-graders, kindergartners. On
January 30, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and lots
of other child development organizations warned Facebook. They
pointed to a wealth of research demonstrating that excessive
use of digital devices and social media is harmful to kids. It
argued that young children simply are not ready to handle
social media accounts at age six.
In addition, there are concerns about data that is being
gathered about these kids. Now, there are certain limits in the
law, we know. There is Children's Online Privacy Protection
Act. What guarantees can you give us that no data from
Messenger Kids is or will be collected or shared with those
that might violate that law?
Mr. Zuckerberg. All right. Senator, so a number of things I
think are important here. The background on Messenger Kids is
we heard feedback from thousands of parents that they want to
be able to stay in touch with their kids and call them, use
apps like FaceTime when they are working late or not around and
want to communicate with their kids, but they want to have
complete control over that. So I think we can all agree that
when your kid is six or seven, even if they have access to a
phone, you want to be able to control everyone who they can
contact. And there was not an app out there that did that, so
we built this service to do that.
The app collects a minimum amount of information that is
necessary to operate the service, so, for example, the messages
that people send is something that we collect in order to
operate the service. But in general, that data is not going to
be shared with third parties. It is not connected to the
broader Facebook experience----
Senator Durbin. Excuse me. As a lawyer, I picked up on that
word ``in general,'' that phrase ``in general.'' It seems to
suggest that in some circumstances it will be shared with third
parties.
Mr. Zuckerberg. No, it will not.
Senator Durbin. All right. Would you be open to the idea
that someone having reached adult age having grown up with
Messenger Kids should be allowed to delete the data you have
collected?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes. As a matter of fact, when you
become 13, which is our legal limit--we do not allow people
under the age of 13 to use Facebook--you do not automatically
go from having a Messenger Kids account to a Facebook account.
You have to start over and get a Facebook account. So I think
it is a good idea to consider making sure that all that
information is deleted, and in general, people are going to be
starting over when they get their Facebook or other accounts.
Senator Durbin. I will close because I just have a few
seconds. Illinois has a Biometric Information Privacy Act, our
state does, which is to regulate the commercial use of facial,
voice, finger, and iris scans and the like. We are now in a
fulsome debate on that, and I am afraid Facebook has come down
with the position of trying to carve out exceptions to that. I
hope you will fill me in on how that is consistent with
protecting privacy. Thank you.
[The information referred to follows:]
Illinois has a biometric information privacy act, our state does,
which is to regulate the commercial use of facial, voice, finger and
iris scans and the like. We're now in a fulsome debate on that and
Facebook has come down on a position trying to carve out exceptions and
I hope you'll fill me in on how that is consistent with protecting
privacy.
We are aware of several pending measures to amend the Illinois
Biometric Information Privacy Act to foster the use of technology to
enhance privacy and data security and combat threats like fraud,
identity theft, and impersonation. Facebook has not supported these
measures or requested any organization or chamber of commerce to do so.
In 2016, Senator Terry Link, the author of the Illinois Biometric
Information Privacy Act, introduced a measure (HB 6074) clarifying that
the original law (1) does not apply to information derived from
physical or digital photographs and (2) uses the term ``scan'' to mean
information that is obtained from an in-person process. These
clarifying amendments were consistent with industry's longstanding
interpretation of the law and Facebook publicly supported them.
Facebook's advocacy is consistent with our commitment to protecting
privacy. As the findings of the Illinois General Assembly confirm, when
people raise privacy concerns about facial recognition, they are
generally about specific uses of facial recognition. In enacting the
Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, the General Assembly
explained that its concern was ``new applications of biometric-
facilitated financial transactions, including finger-scan technologies
at grocery stores, gas stations, and school cafeterias.'' 740 ILCS 14/
5.
Facebook's use of facial recognition in our products, on the other
hand, is very different. Facebook uses facial-recognition technology
with users to provide Facebook users--who choose to join Facebook for
the purpose of connecting with and sharing information about themselves
with others, and affirmatively agree to Facebook's Terms of Service and
Data Policy--with products and features that protect their identities
and enhance their online experiences while giving them control over the
technology. For example, Facebook uses facial-recognition technology to
protect users against impersonators by notifying users when someone
else has uploaded a photo of them for use as a profile photo and to
enable features on the service to people who are visually impaired.
Facebook also uses facial-recognition technology to suggest that people
who upload photos or videos tag the people who appear in the photos or
videos. When someone is tagged in a photo or video, Facebook
automatically notifies that person that he or she has been tagged,
which in turn enables that person to take action if he or she does not
like the content--such as removing the tag or requesting that the
content be removed entirely. Facebook users have always had the ability
to change their settings to prevent Facebook from using facial
recognition to recognize them.
Given the very different uses of facial-recognition technology that
exist, we believe that a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation of
facial-recognition technology is not in the public's best interest, and
we believe that clarification that the Illinois Biometric Information
Privacy Act was not intended to apply to all uses of facial recognition
is consistent with Facebook's commitment to protecting privacy.
Furthermore, our commitment to support meaningful, thoughtfully drafted
privacy legislation means that we can and do oppose measures that
create confusion, interfere with legitimate law enforcement action,
create unnecessary risk of frivolous litigation, or place undue burdens
on people's ability to do business online.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Durbin.
Senator Cornyn.
STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN CORNYN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS
Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for being here.
I note that up until 2014 the mantra or motto of Facebook
was ``move fast and break things.'' Is that correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do not know when we changed it, but the
mantra is currently ``move fast with stable infrastructure,''
which is a much less sexy mantra.
Senator Cornyn. It sounds much more boring, but my question
is during the time that it was Facebook's mantra or motto to
move fast and break things, do you think some of the
misjudgments, perhaps mistakes that you have admitted to here
were as a result of that culture or that attitude, particularly
as regards to personal privacy, the information of your
subscribers?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do think that we made mistakes
because of that, but the broadest mistakes that we made here
are not taking a broad enough view of our responsibility. And
while that was not a matter--the ``move fast'' cultural value
is more tactical around whether engineers can ship things and
different ways that we operate, but I think the big mistake
that we have made looking back on this is viewing our
responsibility as just building tools rather than viewing our
whole responsibility as making sure that those tools are used
for good.
Senator Cornyn. Well, and I appreciate that because
previously or in the past we have been told that platforms like
Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and the like are neutral
platforms and the people who own and run those for profit--and
I am not criticizing doing something for profit in this
country--but they bore no responsibility for the content. You
agree now that Facebook and other social media platforms are
not neutral platforms but bear some responsibility for the
content?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I agree that we are responsible for the
content. And I think that there is--one of the big societal
questions that I think we are going to need to answer is the
current framework that we have is based on this reactive model
that assumed that there weren't AI tools that can proactively
tell whether something was terrorist content or something bad,
so it naturally relied on requiring people to flag for a
company and then the company needed to take reasonable action.
In the future, we are going to have tools that are going to
be able to identify more types of bad content, and I think that
there are moral and legal obligation questions that I think we
will have to wrestle with as a society about when we want to
require companies to take action proactively on certain of
those things----
Senator Cornyn. I----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--and when that gets in the way of----
Senator Cornyn. I appreciate that. I have two minutes
left----
Mr. Zuckerberg. All right.
Senator Cornyn.--to ask you questions. So, interestingly,
the terms of the--what do you call it? The terms of service is
a legal document which discloses to your subscribers how their
information is going to be used, how Facebook is going to
operate. But you concede that you doubt everybody reads or
understands that legalese, those terms of service. So is that
to suggest that the consent that people give, subject to that
terms of services, is not informed consent? In other words,
they may not read it, and even if they read it, they may not
understand it.
Mr. Zuckerberg. I just think we have a broader
responsibility than what the law requires, so I think we need
to----
Senator Cornyn. No, I appreciate that. What I am asking
about in terms of what your subscribers understand in terms of
how their data is going to be used. But let me go to the terms
of service under paragraph number two, you say you own all of
the content and information you post on Facebook. That is what
you have told us here today a number of times. So if I choose
to terminate my Facebook account, can I bar Facebook or any
third parties from using the data that I had previously
supplied for any purpose whatsoever?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator. If you delete your account,
we should get rid of all of your information.
Senator Cornyn. You should or----
Mr. Zuckerberg. We do.
Senator Cornyn.--do you?
Mr. Zuckerberg. We do.
Senator Cornyn. How about third parties that you have
contracted with who use some of that underlying information
perhaps to target advertising for themselves? Do you claw back
that information as well, or does that remain in their custody?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, this is actually a very
important question, and I am glad you brought this up because
there is a very common misperception about Facebook that we
sell data to advertisers, and we do not sell data to
advertisers. We do not sell data to anyone.
Senator Cornyn. Well, you clearly rent it.
Mr. Zuckerberg. What we allow is for advertisers to tell us
who they want to reach, and then we do the placement. So if an
advertiser comes to us and says, all right, I am a ski shop and
I want to sell skis to women, then we might have some sense
because people shared skiing-related content or said they were
interested in that. They shared whether they are a woman, and
then we can show the ads to the right people without that data
ever changing hands and going to the advertiser. That is a very
fundamental part of how our model works and something that is
often misunderstood, so I appreciate that you brought that up.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Cornyn.
We had indicated earlier on that we would take a couple of
breaks and give our witness an opportunity, and I think we have
been going now for just under 2 hours, so I think what we will
do, Mr. Zuckerberg.
Mr. Zuckerberg. We can do a few more.
[Laughter.]
Chairman Thune. You want to keep going?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Maybe 15 minutes.
Chairman Thune. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Does that work?
Chairman Thune. All right. We will keep going. Senator
Blumenthal is up next, and we will commence.
STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL,
U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT
Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for being here today, Mr. Zuckerberg. You have
told us today and you have told the world that Facebook was
deceived by Aleksandr Kogan when he sold user information to
Cambridge Analytica, correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Blumenthal. I want to show you the terms of service
that Aleksandr Kogan provided to Facebook and note for you that
in fact Facebook was on notice that he could sell that user
information. Have you seen these terms of service before?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I have not.
Senator Blumenthal. Who in Facebook was responsible for
seeing those terms of service that put you on notice that that
information could be sold?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, our app review team would be
responsible for that. And----
Senator Blumenthal. Has anyone been fired on that app
review team?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, not because of this.
Senator Blumenthal. Does that term of service not conflict
with the FTC order that Facebook was under at that very time
that this term of service was in fact provided to Facebook? And
you will note that the FTC order specifically requires Facebook
to protect privacy. Is there not a conflict there?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, it certainly appears that we
should have been aware that this app developer submitted a term
that was in conflict with the rules of the platform.
Senator Blumenthal. Well, what happened here was in effect
willful blindness. It was heedless and reckless, which in fact
amounted to a violation of the FTC Consent Decree. Would you
agree?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No, Senator. My understanding is not that
this was a violation of the consent decree. But, as I have said
a number of times today, I think we need to take a broader view
of our responsibility around privacy than just what is mandated
in the current laws and the consent----
Senator Blumenthal. Well, here is my reservation, Mr.
Zuckerberg, and I apologize for interrupting you, but my time
is limited. We have seen the apology tours before. You have
refused to acknowledge even an ethical obligation to have
reported this violation of the FTC consent decree. And we have
letters, we have had contacts with Facebook employees, and I am
going to submit a letter for the record from Sandy Parakilas,
with your permission, that indicates not only a lack of
resources but lack of attention to privacy.
[The information referred to follows:]
Dear Senator Blumenthal,
In 2011 and 2012, I led the team responsible for overseeing
Facebook's data policy enforcement efforts governing third-party
application developers who were using Facebook's App Platform, and
responding to violations of that policy.
In my first week on the job, I was told about a troubling feature
of the App Platform: there was no way to track the use of data after it
left Facebook's servers. That is, once Facebook transferred user data
to the developer, Facebook lost all insight into or control over it. To
prevent abuse, Facebook created a set of platform policies that forbade
certain kinds of activity, such as selling the data or passing it to an
ad network or data broker such as Cambridge Analytica.
Facebook had the following tools to deal with developers who abused
the platform policies: it could call the developer and demand answers;
it could demand an audit of the developer's application and associated
data storage, a right granted in the platform policies; it could ban
the developer from the platform; it could sue the developer for breach
of the policies; or it could do some combination of the above. During
my sixteen months at Facebook, I called many developers and demanded
compliance, but I don't recall the company conducting a single audit of
a developer where the company inspected the developer's data storage.
Lawsuits and outright bans for data policy violations were also very
rare.
Despite the fact that executives at Facebook were well aware that
developers could, without detection, pass data to unauthorized fourth
parties (such as what happened with Cambridge Analytica), little was
done to protect users. A similar, well-publicized incident happened in
2010, where Facebook user IDs were passed by apps to a company called
Rapleaf, which was a data broker. Despite my attempts to raise
awareness about this issue, nothing was done to close the
vulnerability. It was difficult to get any engineering resources
assigned to build or maintain critical features to protect users.
Unfortunately, Facebook's failure to address this clear weakness,
during my time there or after I left, led to Cambridge Analytica's
misappropriation of tens of millions of Americans' data.
Sincerely,
Sandy Parakilas.

Senator Blumenthal. And so my reservation about your
testimony today is that I do not see how you can change your
business model unless there are specific rules of the road.
Your business model is to monetize user information to maximize
profit over privacy. And unless there are specific rules and
requirements enforced by an outside agency, I have no assurance
that these kinds of vague commitments are going to produce
action.
So I want to ask you a couple of very specific questions,
and they are based on legislation that I have offered in the MY
DATA Act and in legislation that Senator Markey is introducing
today, the CONSENT Act, which I am joining. Do you not agree
that companies ought to be required to provide users with
clear, plain information about how their data will be used and
specific ability to consent to the use of that information?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do generally agree with what you
are saying, and I laid that out earlier when I talked about
what----
Senator Blumenthal. Would you agree to an opt-in as opposed
to an opt-out?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think that that certainly makes
sense to discuss, and I think the details around this matter a
lot, so----
Senator Blumenthal. Would you agree that users should be
able to access all of their information?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes, of course.
Senator Blumenthal. All of the information that you collect
as a result of purchases from data brokers, as well as tracking
them?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we have already a download-your-
information tool that allows people to see and to take out all
of the information that they have put into Facebook or that
Facebook knows about them. So yes, I agree with that. We
already have that.
Senator Blumenthal. I have a number of other specific
requests that you agree to support as part of legislation. I
think legislation is necessary. The rules of the road have to
be the result of congressional action.
Facebook has participated recently in the fight against the
scourge of sex trafficking, and the bill that we have just
passed, it will be signed into law tomorrow, SESTA, the Stop
Enabling Sex Trafficking Act, was the result of our
cooperation. I hope that we can cooperate on this kind of
measure as well.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I look forward to having my team
work with you on this.
[The information referred to follows:]
I have a number of other specific requests that you agree to
support as part of legislation. I think legislation is necessary. The
rules of the road have to be the result of congressional action. We
have--Facebook has participated recently in the fight against the
scourge of sex trafficking and the bill that we've just passed. It will
be signed into law tomorrow. The Stop Exploiting Sex Trafficking Act
was as a result of our cooperation and I hope we can cooperate on this
kind of measure as well.
Facebook supports SESTA, and we were very pleased to be able to
work successfully with a bipartisan group of Senators on a bill that
protects women and children from the harms of sex trafficking.
Facebook is generally not opposed to regulation but wants to ensure
it is the right regulation. The issues facing the industry are complex,
multi-faceted, and affect an important part of peoples' lives. As such,
Facebook is absolutely committed to working with regulators, like
Congress, to craft the right regulations. Facebook would be happy to
review any proposed legislation and provide comments.
Senator Blumenthal. Thank you.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal.
Senator Cruz.
STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ,
U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS
Senator Cruz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg, welcome. Thank you for being here.
Mr. Zuckerberg, does Facebook consider itself a neutral
public forum?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we consider ourselves to be a
platform for all ideas.
Senator Cruz. Let me ask the question again. Does Facebook
consider itself to be a neutral public forum? And
representatives of your company have given conflicting answers
on this. Are you a First Amendment----
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well----
Senator Cruz.--speaker expressing your views, or are you a
neutral public forum allowing everyone to speak?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, here is how we think about this. I
do not believe that--there is certain content that clearly we
do not allow, right? Hate speech, terrorist content, nudity,
anything that makes people feel unsafe in the community. From
that perspective, that is why we generally try to refer to what
we do as a platform for----
Senator Cruz. Let me try----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--all ideas----
Senator Cruz.--this because the time is constrained. It is
just a simple question. The predicate for Section 230 immunity
under the CDA is that you are a neutral public forum. Do you
consider yourself a neutral public forum or are you engaged in
political speech, which is your right under the First
Amendment?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, our goal is certainly not to
engage in political speech. I am not that familiar with the
specific legal language of the law that you speak to, so I
would need to follow up with you on that. I am just trying to
lay out how broadly I think about this.
[The information referred to follows:]
The predicate for Section 230 immunity under the CDA is that you're
a neutral public forum. Do you consider yourself a neutral public forum
or are you engaged in political speech, which is your right under the
First Amendment?
We are, first and foremost, a technology company. Facebook does not
create or edit the content that our users published on our platform.
While we seek to be a platform for a broad range of ideas, we do
moderate content in good faith according to published community
standards in order to keep users on the platform safe, reduce
objectionable content and to make sure users participate on the
platform responsibly.
Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act provides that ``[N]o
provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as
the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another
information content provider.'' Outside of certain specific exceptions,
this means that online platforms that host content posted by others are
generally not liable for the speech of their users, and, indeed,
Section 230 explicitly provides that a platform that chooses to
moderate content on its service based on its own standards does not
incur liability on the basis of that decision. Specifically, 47 U.S.C.
Sec. 230(c)(2) provides, in relevant part, that ``[N]o provider or user
of an interactive computer service shall be held liable on account of--
(A) any action voluntarily taken in good faith to restrict access to or
availability of material that the provider or user considers to be
obscene, lewd, lascivious, filthy, excessively violent, harassing, or
otherwise objectionable, whether or not such material is
constitutionally protected.''
Senator Cruz. Well, Mr. Zuckerberg, I will say there are a
great many Americans who I think are deeply concerned that
Facebook and other tech companies are engaged in a pervasive
pattern of bias and political censorship. There have been
numerous instances with Facebook. In May of 2016, Gizmodo
reported that Facebook had purposefully and routinely
suppressed conservative stories from trending news, including
stories about CPAC, including stories about Mitt Romney,
including stories about the Lois Lerner IRS scandal, including
stories about Glenn Beck.
In addition to that, Facebook has initially shut down the
Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day page, has blocked a post of a Fox
News reporter, has blocked over two dozen Catholic pages, and
most recently blocked Trump supporters Diamond and Silk page
with 1.2 million Facebook followers after determining their
content and brand were, quote, ``unsafe to the community.'' To
a great many Americans, that appears to be a pervasive pattern
of political bias. Do you agree with that assessment?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, let me say a few things about
this. First, I understand where that concern is coming from
because Facebook and the tech industry are located in Silicon
Valley, which is an extremely left-leaning place. And this is
actually a concern that I have and that I try to root out in
the company is making sure that we do not have any bias in the
work that we do. And I think it is a fair concern that people
would at least wonder about.
Senator Cruz. So let me ask this question.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Now----
Senator Cruz. Are you aware of any ad or page that has been
taken down from Planned Parenthood?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am not, but let me just--can I--
--
Senator Cruz. How about MoveOn.org?
Mr. Zuckerberg.--finish? I am sorry.
Senator Cruz. How about MoveOn.org?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I am not specifically aware of those
instances.
Senator Cruz. How about any democratic candidate for
office?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I am not specifically aware. I mean, I am
not sure.
Senator Cruz. In your testimony you say that you have
15,000 to 20,000 people working on security and content review.
Do you know the political orientation of those 15,000 to 20,000
people engaged in content review?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No, Senator. We do not generally ask people
about their political orientation when they are joining the
company.
Senator Cruz. So, as CEO, have you ever made hiring or
firing decisions based on political positions or what
candidates they supported?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No.
Senator Cruz. Why was Palmer Luckey fired?
Mr. Zuckerberg. That is a specific personnel matter. That
seems like it would be inappropriate to speak to here.
Senator Cruz. You just made a specific representation that
you did not make decisions based on political views. Is that
accurate?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, I can commit that it was not because
of a political view.
Senator Cruz. Do you know of those 15,000 to 20,000 people
engaged in content review how many if any have ever supported
financially a Republican candidate for office?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not know that.
Senator Cruz. Your testimony says, ``It is not enough that
we just connect people; we have to make sure those connections
are positive.'' It says, ``We have to make sure people are not
using their voice to hurt people or spread misinformation. We
have a responsibility not just to build tools but to make sure
those tools are used for good.'' Mr. Zuckerberg, do you feel it
is your responsibility to assess users, whether they are good
and positive connections or ones that those 15,000 to 20,000
people deem unacceptable or deplorable?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, you are asking about me
personally?
Senator Cruz. Facebook.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think that there are a number of
things that we would all agree are clearly bad. Foreign
interference in our elections, terrorism, self-harm, those are
things----
Senator Cruz. I am talking about censorship.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Oh, well, I think that you would probably
agree that we should remove terrorist propaganda from the
service. So that I agree I think is clearly bad activity that
we want to get down, and we are generally proud of how well we
do with that.
Now, what I can say--and I do want to get this in before
the end here--is that I am very committed to making sure that
Facebook is a platform for all ideas. That is a very important
founding principle of what we do. We are proud of the discourse
and the different ideas that people can share on the service,
and that is something that, as long as I am running the
company, I am going to be committed to making sure is the case.
Senator Cruz. Thank you.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Cruz. Do you want to
break now?
[Laughter.]
Chairman Thune. Or do you want to keep going?
[Laughter.]
Mr. Zuckerberg. Sure. I mean, that was pretty good, so--all
right.
[Laughter.]
Chairman Thune. All right. Senator Whitehouse is up next,
but if you want to take a----
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Chairman Thune.--five-minute break right now, we have now
been going a good 2 hours so----
Mr. Zuckerberg. Thank you.
Chairman Thune.--we will recess for 5 minutes and
reconvene.
[Recess.]
Chairman Grassley [presiding]. The Committee will come to
order.
Before I call on Senator Whitehouse, Senator Feinstein
asked permission to put letters and statements in the record.
And without objection, they will be put in from the ACLU, the
Electronic Privacy Information Center, the Association for
Computing Machinery Public Policy Council, and Public
Knowledge.

American Civil Liberties Union
Washington, DC, April 9, 2018
Re: Questions for Mark Zuckerberg
Dear Senator,
On behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union (``ACLU''), we
submit this letter for the record in connection with the Senate
Judiciary and Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committees joint
hearing, ``Facebook, Social Media Privacy, and the Use and Abuse of
Data,'' where Facebook Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Mark
Zuckerberg is scheduled to testify.
Over the last month, the public has learned of various privacy
breaches that have impacted tens of millions of Facebook users. The
personal information of as many as 87 million people may have been
improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, which appears to have used
this data to influence American voters.\1\ Most Facebook users have
reportedly had their public profile scraped for malicious purposes.\2\
And, Facebook is currently being sued over concerns that it continues
to fail to prevent ads that appear on the platform from improperly
discriminating on the basis of gender, age, and other protected
characteristics.\3\ These incidents highlight both the existence of
systemic deficiencies within Facebook and the need for stronger privacy
laws in the U.S. to protect consumers.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We anticipate that members will question Mr. Zuckerberg regarding
the recent incidents, the reasons Facebook has failed to adequately
protect user privacy, and regulatory proposals the company will
support. In addition to these topics, we urge you to ask Mr. Zuckerberg
the following questions:
Why has Facebook failed to take sufficient steps to ensure
that advertisers do not wrongly exclude individuals from
housing, employment, credit, and public accommodation ads based
on gender, ethnic affinity, age, or other protected
characteristics?
Will Facebook provide privacy protections related to
consent, retention, data portability, and transparency to
American consumers that it will provide to EU consumers as a
result of Europe's law on data protection, the General Data
Protection Regulation (``GDPR''),\4\ which will go into effect
on May 25, 2018? In short, does Facebook plan to offer better
privacy protection to Europeans than it does to Americans?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

of the European Union on the Protection of Natural Persons with Regard

Regulation) [hereinafter GDPR], April 27, 2016, available at http://

?uri=CELEX:32016R0679&qid=1490179745294&from=en
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.
Facebook Ad Discrimination
Facebook offers advertisers many thousands of targeting categories,
including those based on characteristics that are protected by civil
rights laws--such as, gender, age, familial status, sexual orientation,
disability, and veteran status--and those based on ``proxies'' for such
characteristics. In the case of ads for housing, credit, and
employment, discriminatory ad targeting and exclusion is illegal. Even
outside these contexts, however, discriminatory targeting could raise
civil rights concerns. For example, do we want any advertisers to be
able to offer higher prices to individuals who Facebook believes are a
particular race, or to exclude them from receiving ads offering certain
commercial benefits?
Following complaints of discriminatory targeting, including efforts
by the ACLU to raise concerns directly with the company, Facebook
announced that it would no longer allow housing, credit, and employment
ads targeted based on ``affinity'' for certain ethnic groups.\5\
However, it did not prohibit targeting based on gender, age, veteran
status, or other protected categories.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

newsroom.fb.com/news/2016/11/updates-to-ethnic-affinity-marketing/
(last visited Apr 6, 2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These changes also did not address questions or concerns
surrounding intentional targeting or exclusion of ads for public
accommodations (for example, transportation). However, even after
Facebook announced that it would no longer allow targeting of certain
ads based on ethnic affinity, a ProPublica study found that the
platform still failed to catch and prevent discriminatory ads that
improperly excluded categories of users under the guise of targeting
based on interests or affinity, including African Americans, Jewish
people, and Spanish speakers.\6\ Since then, Facebook has temporarily
turned off ad targeting based on ethnic affinity until it can address
these issues.\7\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Members should ask Zuckerberg why the platform has not turned off
ad targeting for all protected categories or their proxies in the
housing, credit, and employment, given that existing civil rights laws
prohibit discriminatory ads in these contexts. In addition, they should
question Zuckerberg regarding why the company has not taken sufficient
steps--including increased auditing and facilitating research from
independent entities--to assess and protect against discrimination
outside of these contexts.
2. Privacy Protections Under the GDPR
For years, the ACLU has called on Facebook to provide more privacy
protections to consumers and has emphasized the need for baseline
privacy legislation in the U.S. With regards to Facebook, among other
things, we have urged increased transparency, requirements that
customers provide affirmative opt-in consent to share, use, or retain
information, enhanced app privacy settings, auditing to assess third
parties with access to Facebook, and other reforms. Many of these
reforms have not been fully adopted, even in the wake of the Cambridge
Analytica incident.\8\

privacy-technology/internet-privacy/after-facebook-privacy-debacle-its-
time-clear-steps-protect (last visited Apr 6, 2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
However, some of these changes may soon be required for Facebook's
operation in the European Union as a result of Europe's law on data
protection, the GDPR, which will go into effect on May 25. The GDPR
does not provide an exact template for what baseline privacy regulation
should look like in the U.S.--indeed, provisions such as the right to
be forgotten would likely be unconstitutional if applied in the U.S.
Nevertheless, there are elements of the GDPR that, if applied in the
U.S., would help to ensure that Americans have full control over their
data and are equipped with the tools necessary to safeguard their
rights.
In recent statements, Zuckerberg has said that Facebook is working
to extend a version of the GDPR that could be extended globally, but
has failed to provide details regarding which provisions of the law
will be applied to U.S. consumers.\9\ Given this, members of Congress
should press Zuckerberg on whether Facebook intends to voluntarily
provide certain GDPR protections\10\ to U.S. consumers, including:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ David Ingrem & Joseph Menn, Exclusive: Facebook CEO stops short
of extending European privacy globally, Reuters, Apr. 3, 2018, https://
www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-ceo-privacy-exclusive/exclusive-
facebook-ceo-stops-short-of-extending-european-privacy-globally-idUSKC
N1HA2M1 (last visited Apr 6, 2018).
\10\ GDPR places different restrictions on entities based on
whether they are ``controllers'' or ``processors'' of data. Facebook
has stated that it acts as a controller for the majority of its
business practices, though acts as a processor in certain instances
when ``working with business and third parties.'' For purposes of this
letter, we have included obligations on Facebook as both a controller
and processor. See What is the General Data Protection Regulation,
Facebook Business, available at https://www.facebook.com/business/gdpr.
Consent Requirements: Absent certain exceptions,\11\ the
GDPR requires that companies obtain user consent to collect,
use, or otherwise process their personal data.\12\ This consent
must be freely given, specific, informed, and made by an
affirmative action or statement by the user, and authorized by
a parent/guardian if the user is under age 16.\13\ If consent
is written, the company must present the information in a
manner that is intelligible, easily accessible, and uses clear
and plain language. In addition, the user must have the right
to withdraw their consent at any time.\14\ In addition,
processing of certain categories of sensitive data, like
biometrics, religious beliefs, health data, and political
opinions requires more rigorous ``explicit consent.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ Other than consent, a company may process data to fulfill a
contractual obligation to which the user is a party or to take steps at
the request of the user prior to a contract; to comply with a legal
obligation, to perform a task in the public interest; to protect the
vital interests of a data subject or other person; or to pursue a
legitimate interest unless the interests are overridden by the
interests/rights of the data subject. See GDRP, supra note 4, art. 6.
\12\ Id.
\13\ Id. at art. 4. GDPR permits members states to provide a lower
age, no younger than 13, for consent purposes. See Id. at art. 6.
\14\ Id. at art.7.
Data Portability: GDPR provides users the right to obtain a
copy of the data they have provided in a ``structured, commonly
used and machine-readable format'' and to have this data
transferred to another provider.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\15\ Id. at art. 20.
Transparency: GDPR states that companies collecting data
must provide transparency regarding their data processes. Among
other things, users are entitled to know the amount of time
their personal data will be stored (or the criteria used to
determine the retention period), categories of personal data
collected, whether the provision of the data is a statutory or
contractual requirement, the existence of automated decision
making, who receives their personal data, and the purpose for
which their personal data is being collected, used, or
otherwise processed.\16\ There are also similar transparency
requirements in cases where an entity obtains personal data
about an individual from a source other than the
individual.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\16\ Id. at art. 12.
\17\ Id. at art. 14.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Use of Data for Marketing: GDPR provides user the right to
object to use of their data for marking purposes, including
profiling for direct marketing purposes.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\18\ Id. at art. 21.
Automated Decision-Making: Absent certain exceptions (for
example, explicit consent), GDPR states that users have the
right to not be subject to decisions based solely on automated
processing, including profiling, if it has a legal or similarly
significant effect.\19\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\19\ Id. at art. 22.
Breach Notification: In cases of any personal data breach,
companies must notify a user if it is likely to result in a
``high risk to the rights and freedoms'' of individuals.\20\
While the ACLU believes that notification should be required in
circumstances far broader than this--and there are state laws
that require notice in any case where there is a breach
involving certain types of personal data \21\--the GDPR breach
policy could be a step forward in cases where there is not more
protective applicable U.S. law.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\20\ Id. at art. 34.
\21\ See California Civ. Code s. 1798.82(a).
Voluntary application of GDPR requirements by companies to U.S.
consumers cannot be a substitute for baseline privacy legislation in
the U.S., which must include enforcement mechanisms, redress in the
case of breaches, and a private right of action not subject to
mandatory arbitration. Until such legislation, however, voluntary
application of these rights could help to safeguard users in the U.S.

We appreciate your interest in this important issue. For many years,
the Electronic Privacy Information Center (``EPIC'') has worked with
both the Judiciary Committee and the Commerce Committee to help protect

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this statement from EPIC, we outline the history of Facebook's
2011 Consent Order with the Federal Trade Commission, point to key
developments (including the failure of the FTC to enforce the Order),
and make a few preliminary recommendations. Our assessment is that the
Cambridge Analytica breach, as well as a range of threats to consumer
privacy and democratic institutions, could have been prevented if the
Commission had enforced the Order.
EPIC would welcome the opportunity to testify, to provide more
information, and to answer questions you may have. Our statement
follows below.
EPIC, the 2011 FTC Consent Order, and Earlier Action by the FTC
Facebook's transfer of personal data to Cambridge Analytica was
prohibited by a Consent Order the FTC reached with Facebook in 2011 in
response to an extensive investigation and complaint pursued by EPIC
and several U.S. consumer privacy organizations.\3\ The FTC's failure
to enforce the order we helped obtain has resulted in the unlawful
transfer of 87 million user records to a controversial data mining firm
to influence a presidential election as well as the vote in Brexit. The
obvious question now is ``why did the FTC fail to act?'' The problems
were well known, widely documented, and had produced a favorable legal
judgement in 2011.

Back in 2007, Facebook launched Facebook Beacon, which allowed a
Facebook user's purchases to be publicized on their friends' News Feed
after transacting with third-party sites.\4\ Users were unaware that
such features were being tracked, and the privacy settings originally
did not allow users to opt out. As a result of widespread criticism,
Facebook Beacon was eventually shutdown.

In testimony before the Senate Commerce Committee in 2008, we
warned about Facebook's data practices:
Users of social networking sites are also exposed to the
information collection practices of third party social
networking applications. On Facebook, installing applications
grants this third-party application provider access to nearly
all of a user's information. Significantly, third party
applications do not only access the information about a given
user that has added the application. Applications by default
get access to much of the information about that user's friends
and network members that the user can see. This level of access
is often not necessary. Researchers at the University of
Virginia found that 90 percent of applications are given more
access privileges than they need.\5\

Nonetheless in February 2009, Facebook changed its Terms of
Service. The new TOS allowed Facebook to use anything a user uploaded
to the site for any purpose, at any time, even after the user ceased to
use Facebook. Further, the TOS did not provide for a way that users
could completely close their account. Rather, users could
``deactivate'' their account, but all the information would be retained
by Facebook, rather than deleted.
EPIC planned to file an FTC complaint, alleging that the new Terms
of Service violated the FTC Act Section 5, and constituted ``unfair and
deceptive trade practices.'' In response to this planned complaint, and
a very important campaign organized by the ``Facebook Users Against the
New Terms of Service,'' Facebook returned to its previous Terms of
Service. Facebook then established a comprehensive program of Governing
Principles and a statement of Rights and Responsibilities.\6\

As we reported in 2009:
Facebook has announced the results of the vote on site
governance. The initial outcome indicates that approximately 75
percent of users voted for the new terms of service which
includes the new Facebook Principles and Statement of Rights
and Responsibilities. Under the new Principles, Facebook users
will ``own and control their information.'' Facebook also took
steps to improve account deletion, to limit sublicenses, and to
reduce data exchanges with application developers. EPIC
supports the adoption of the new terms. For more information,
see EPIC's page on Social Networking Privacy.\7\

\7\ EPIC, Facebook Gets Ready to Adopt Terms of Service (Apr. 24,
2009) https://epic.org/2009/04/facebook-gets-ready-to-adopt-t.html
However, Facebook failed to uphold its commitments to a public
governance structure for the company.
From mid-2009 through 2011, EPIC and a coalition of consumer
organizations pursued comprehensive accountability for the social media
platform.\8\ When Facebook broke its final commitment, we went ahead
with a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission. Our complaint alleged
that Facebook had changed user privacy settings and disclosed the
personal data of users to third parties without the consent of
users.\9\ EPIC and others had conducted extensive research and
documented the instances of Facebook overriding the users' privacy
settings to reveal personal information and to disclose, for commercial
benefit, user data, and the personal data of friends and family
members, to third parties without their knowledge or affirmative
consent.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ There is a longer history of significant events concerning the
efforts of Facebook users to establish democratic accountability for
Facebook during the 2008-2009 period. The filing of the 2009 complaint
came about after it became clear that Facebook would not uphold its
commitments to the Statement of Right and Responsibilities it had
established. It would also be worth reconstructing the history of the
``Facebook Users Against the New Terms of Service'' as Facebook
destroyed the group and all records of its members and activities after
the organizers helped lead a successful campaign against the company.
Julius Harper was among the organizers of the campaign. A brief history
was written by Ben Popken in 2009 for The Consumerist, ``What
Facebook's Users Want In The Next Terms Of Service,'' https://
consumerist.com/2009/02/23/what-facebooks-users-want-in-the-next-terms-
of-service/. Julius said this in 2012: ``Most people on Facebook don't
even know they can vote or even that a vote is going on. What is a
democracy if you don't know where the polling place is? Or that a vote
is even being held? How can you participate? Ignorance becomes a tool
that can be used to disenfranchise people.'' Facebook upsets some by

\10\ FTC Facebook Settlement, EPIC.org, https://epic.org/privacy/

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We explained our argument clearly in the 2009 EPIC complaint with
the Commission (attached in full to this statement):
This complaint concerns material changes to privacy settings
made by Facebook, the largest social network service in the
United States, which adversely impact users of the Facebook
service. Facebook's changes to users' privacy settings disclose
personal information to the public that was previously
restricted. Facebook's changes to users' privacy settings also
disclose personal information to third parties that was
previously not available. These changes violate user
expectations, diminish user privacy, and contradict Facebook's
own representations. These business practices are Unfair and
Deceptive Trade Practices, subject to review by the Federal
Trade Commission (the ``Commission'') under section 5 of the
Federal Trade Commission Act.\11\

Investigation, Injunction, and Other Relief) before the Federal Trade
Commission, Washington, D.C. (filed Dec. 17, 2009), http://
www.epic.org/privacy/inrefacebook/EPIC-FacebookComplaint.pdf.
We should also make clear that the 2009 complaint that EPIC filed
with the Federal Trade Commission about Facebook was not the first to
produce a significant outcome. In July and August 2001, EPIC and a
coalition of fourteen leading consumer groups filed complaints with the
Federal Trade Commission (FTC) alleging that the Microsoft Passport
system violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTCA),
which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices in trade.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ EPIC, Microsoft Passport Investigation Docket, https://
epic.org/privacy/consumer/microsoft/passport.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPIC and the groups alleged that Microsoft violated the law by
linking the Windows XP operating system to repeated exhortations to
sign up for Passport; by representing that Passport protects privacy,
when it and related services facilitate profiling, tracking and
monitoring; by signing up Hotmail users for Passport without consent or
even the ability to opt-out; by representing that the system complies
with the Children's Online Privacy Protection Act; by not allowing
individuals to delete their account; and by representing that the
system securely holds individuals' data.
We requested that the FTC initiate an investigation into the
information collection practices of Windows XP and other services, and
to order Microsoft to revise XP registration procedures; to block the
sharing of Passport information among Microsoft properties absent
explicit consent; to allow users of Windows XP to gain access to
Microsoft websites without disclosing their actual identity; and to
enable users of Windows XP to easily integrate services provided by
non-Microsoft companies for online payment, electronic commerce, and
other Internet-based commercial activity.
The Federal Trade Commission undertook the investigation we
requested and issued an important consent order. As the Commission
explained announcing its enforcement action in 2002:
Microsoft Corporation has agreed to settle Federal Trade
Commission charges regarding the privacy and security of
personal information collected from consumers through its
``Passport'' web services. As part of the settlement, Microsoft
will implement a comprehensive information security program for
Passport and similar services. . . .
The Commission initiated its investigation of the Passport
services following a July 2001 complaint from a coalition of
consumer groups led by the Electronic Privacy Information
Center (EPIC).
According to the Commission's complaint, Microsoft falsely
represented that:
It employs reasonable and appropriate measures under
the circumstances to maintain and protect the privacy and
confidentiality of consumers' personal information
collected through its Passport and Passport Wallet
services, including credit card numbers and billing
information stored in Passport Wallet;
Purchases made with Passport Wallet are generally safer
or more secure than purchases made at the same site without
Passport Wallet when, in fact, most consumers received
identical security at those sites regardless of whether
they used Passport Wallet to complete their transactions;
Passport did not collect any personally identifiable
information other than that described in its privacy policy
when, in fact, Passport collected and held, for a limited
time, a personally identifiable sign-in history for each
user; and
The Kids Passport program provided parents control over
what information participating Websites could collect from
their children.
The proposed consent order prohibits any misrepresentation of
information practices in connection with Passport and other
similar services. It also requires Microsoft to implement and
maintain a comprehensive information security program. In
addition, Microsoft must have its security program certified as
meeting or exceeding the standards in the consent order by an
independent professional every two years.\13\

Then in December 2004, EPIC filed a complaint with the Federal
Trade Commission against databroker Choicepoint, urging the Commission
to investigate the compilation and sale of personal dossiers by data
brokers such as Choicepoint.\15\ Based on the EPIC complaint, in 2005,
the FTC charged that Choicepoint did not have reasonable procedures to
screen and verify prospective businesses for lawful purposes and as a
result compromised the personal financial records of more than 163,000
customers in its database. In January 2006, the FTC announced a
settlement with Choicepoint, requiring the company to pay $10 million
in civil penalties and provide $5 millions for consumer redress. EPIC's
Choicepoint complaint produced the largest civil fine at the time in
the history of the FTC.\16\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Microsoft order led to user-centric identity scheme that, if
broadly adopted, could have done much to preserve the original open,
decentralized structure of the Internet. The Choicepoint order led to
significant reforms in the data broker industry. And it is worth noting
that both investigations were successfully pursued with Republican
chairmen in charge of the Federal agency and both actions were based on
unanimous decisions by all of the Commissioners.
The Facebook complaint should have produced an outcome even more
consequential than the complaints concerning Microsoft and Choicepoint.
In 2011, the FTC, based the materials we provided in 2009 and 2010,
confirmed our findings and recommendations. In some areas, the FTC even
went further. The FTC issued a Preliminary Order against Facebook in
2011 and then a Final Order in 2012.\17\ In the press release
accompanying the settlement, the FTC stated that Facebook ``deceived
consumers by telling them they could keep their information on Facebook
private, and then repeatedly allowing it to be shared and made
public.'' \18\

According to the FTC, under the proposed settlement Facebook is:
``barred from making misrepresentations about the privacy or
security of consumers' personal information;''
``required to obtain consumers' affirmative express consent
before enacting changes that override their privacy
preferences;''
``required to prevent anyone from accessing a user's
material more than 30 days after the user has deleted his or
her account;''
``required to establish and maintain a comprehensive privacy
program designed to address privacy risks associated with the
development and management of new and existing products and

``required, within 180 days, and every two years after that
for the next 20 years, to obtain independent, third-party

meets or exceeds the requirements of the FTC order, and to
ensure that the privacy of consumers' information is

The reporting requirements are set out in more detail in the text

of the Final Order. According to the Final Order:
[The] Respondent [Facebook] shall, no later than the date of
service of this order, establish and implement, and thereafter
maintain, a comprehensive privacy program that is reasonably
designed to (1) address privacy risks related to the
development and management of new and existing products and
services for consumers, and (2) protect the privacy and
confidentiality of covered information. Such program, the
content and implementation of which must be documented in
writing, shall contain controls and procedures appropriate to
Respondent's size and complexity, the nature and scope of
Respondent's activities, and the sensitivity of the covered
information, including:
A.
the designation of an employee or employees to coordinate and
be responsible for the privacy program.
B.
the identification of reasonably foreseeable, material risks,
both internal and external, that could result in
Respondent's unauthorized collection, use, or disclosure of
covered information and an assessment of the sufficiency of
any safeguards in place to control these risks. At a
minimum, this privacy risk assessment should include
consideration of risks in each area of relevant operation,
including, but not limited to: (1) employee training and
management, including training on the requirements of this
order, and (2) product design, development, and research.
C.
the design and implementation of reasonable controls and
procedures to address the risks identified through the
privacy risk assessment, and regular testing or monitoring
of the effectiveness of those controls and procedures.
D.
the development and use of reasonable steps to select and
retain service providers capable of appropriately
protecting the privacy of covered information they receive
from Respondent and requiring service providers, by
contract, to implement and maintain appropriate privacy
protections for such covered information.
E.
the evaluation and adjustment of Respondent's privacy program
in light of the results of the testing and monitoring
required by subpart C, any material changes to Respondent's
operations or business arrangements, or any other
circumstances that Respondent knows or has reason to know
may have a material impact on the effectiveness of its
privacy program.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\20\ Facebook Consent Order.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, the Final Order stated:
Respondent shall obtain initial and biennial assessments and
reports (``Assessments'') from a qualified, objective,
independent third-party professional, who uses procedures and
standards generally accepted in the profession. A person
qualified to prepare such Assessments shall have a minimum of
three (3) years of experience in the field of privacy and data
protection. All persons selected to conduct such Assessments
and prepare such reports shall be approved by the Associate
Director for Enforcement, Bureau of Consumer Protection,
Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C. 20580, in his or her
sole discretion. Any decision not to approve a person selected
to conduct such Assessments shall be accompanied by a writing
setting forth in detail the reasons for denying such approval.
The reporting period for the Assessments shall cover: (1) the
first one hundred and eighty (180) days after service of the
order for the initial Assessment, and (2) each two (2) year
period thereafter for twenty (20) years after service of the
order for the biennial Assessments. Each Assessment shall:
A.
set forth the specific privacy controls that Respondent has
implemented and maintained during the reporting period;
B.
explain how such privacy controls are appropriate to
Respondent's size and complexity, the nature and scope of
Respondent's activities, and the sensitivity of the covered
information;
C.
explain how the privacy controls that have been implemented
meet or exceed the protections required by Part IV of this
order; and
D.
certify that the privacy controls are operating with sufficient
effectiveness to provide reasonable assurance to protect
the privacy of covered information and that the controls
have so operated throughout the reporting period.
Each Assessment shall be prepared and completed within sixty
(60) days after the end of the reporting period to which the
Assessment applies. Respondent shall provide the initial
Assessment to the Associate Director for Enforcement, Bureau of
Consumer Protection, Federal Trade Commission, Washington, D.C.
20580, within ten (10) days after the Assessment has been
prepared. All subsequent biennial Assessments shall be retained
by Respondent until the order is terminated and provided to the
Associate Director of Enforcement within ten (10) days of
request.\21\

could be improved.\22\ In response to the FTC's request for public

No. 092 3184, (Dec. 27, 2011), https://epic.org/privacy/facebook/
Facebook-FTC-Settlement-Comments-FINAL.pdf.
EPIC supports the findings in the FTC Complaint and supports,
in part, the directives contained in the Consent Order. The
Order makes clear that companies should not engage in unfair
and deceptive trade practices, particularly in the collection
and use of personal data. However, the proposed Order is
insufficient to address the concerns originally identified by
EPIC and the consumer coalition, as well as those findings
established by the Commission. Consistent with this earlier
determination, to protect the interests of Facebook users, and
in light of recent changes in the company's business practices,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPIC urges the Commission to require Facebook to:
Restore the privacy settings that users had in 2009,
before the unfair and deceptive practices addressed by the
Complaint began;
Allow users to access all of the data that Facebook
keeps about them;
Cease creating facial recognition profiles without
users' affirmative consent;
Make Facebook's privacy audits publicly available to
the greatest extent possible;
Cease secret post-log out tracking of users across
websites.
At the time, the FTC settlement with Facebook was widely viewed as
a major step forward for the protection of consumer privacy in the
United States. The Chairman of the FTC stated, ``Facebook is obligated
to keep the promises about privacy that it makes to its hundreds of
millions of users. Facebook's innovation does not have to come at the
expense of consumer privacy. The FTC action will ensure it will not.''
Mark Zuckerberg said at the time of the Consent Order that the company
had made ``a bunch of mistakes.'' \23\ The FTC Chair called Mr.
Zuckerberg's post a ``good sign'' and said, ``He admits mistakes. That
can only be good for consumers.'' \24\

Commissioners and staff of the FTC later testified before Congress,
citing the Facebook Consent Order as a major accomplishment for the
Commission.\25\ And U.S. policymakers held out the FTC's work in
discussions with trading partners for the proposition that the U.S.
could provide privacy protections to those users of US-based services.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\25\ According to the statement of the FTC Commissioners who
testified before the Senate Commerce Committee in 2012:
Similar to the Google order, the Commission's consent order against
Facebook prohibits the company from deceiving consumers with regard to
privacy; requires it to obtain users' affirmative express consent
before sharing their information in a way that exceeds their privacy
settings; and requires it to implement a comprehensive privacy program
and obtain outside audits. In addition, Facebook must ensure that it
will stop providing access to a user's information after she deletes
that information.

As part of its privacy and security enforcement program, the
FTC has also sought to protect EU consumers by bringing
enforcement actions that involved Safe Harbor violations. . . .
Twenty-year consent orders require Google, Facebook, and
Myspace to implement comprehensive privacy programs that must
be reasonably designed to address privacy risks related to the
development and management of new and existing products and
services and to protect the privacy and confidentiality of
personal information. The comprehensive privacy programs
mandated under these orders must identify foreseeable material
risks and have controls to address those risks. The companies
must also submit to ongoing, independent assessments of their
privacy programs, which must be provided to the FTC. The orders
also prohibit these companies from misrepresenting their
privacy practices and their participation in any privacy or
security program. This prohibition would also apply to
companies' acts and practices under the new Privacy Shield
Framework. . . . Consequently, these FTC orders help protect
over a billion consumers worldwide, hundreds of millions of
whom reside in Europe.\26\

Yet the Federal Trade Commission never charged Facebook with a
single violation of the 2011 Consent Order.
The Google Consent Order and the FTC's Subsequent Failure to Enforce
Consent Orders
In 2011, we also had also obtained a significant consent order at
the FTC against Google after the disastrous roll-out of Google
``Buzz.'' In that case, the FTC established a consent order after
Google tried to enroll Gmail users into a social networking service
without meaningful consent. The outcome was disastrous. Personal
contact information was made publicly available by Google as part of
its effort to establish a social network service to compete with
Facebook. EPIC filed a detailed complaint with the Commission in
February that produced a consent order in 2011, comparable to the order
for Facebook.\27\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
But a problem we did not anticipate became apparent almost
immediately: the Federal Trade Commission was unwilling to enforce its
own consent orders. Almost immediately after the settlements, both
Facebook and Google began to test the FTC's willingness to stand behind
its judgements. Dramatic changes in the two companies' advertising
models led to more invasive tracking of Internet users. Online and
offline activities were increasingly becoming merged.
To EPIC and many others, these changes violated the terms of the
consent orders. We urged the FTC to establish a process to review these
changes and publish its findings so that the public could at least
evaluate whether the companies were complying with the original orders.
But the Commission remained silent, even as it claimed that its model
was working well for these companies.
In 2012, EPIC sued the Commission when it became clear that Google
was proposing to do precisely what the FTC said it could not--
consolidate user data across various services that came with diverse
privacy policies in order to build detailed individual profiles. The
problem was widely understood. Many members of Congress in both
parties, state attorneys general, and Jon Leibowitz, the head of the
FTC itself, warned about the possible outcome. Even the federal court,
which ruled that it could not require the agency to enforce its order,
was sympathetic. ``EPIC--along with many other individuals and
organizations--has advanced serious concerns that may well be
legitimate, and the FTC, which has advised the Court that the matter is
under review, may ultimately decide to institute an enforcement
action,'' wrote the judge.\28\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
But that enforcement action never came. Even afterward, EPIC and
other consumer privacy organizations have continued to urge the Federal
Trade Commission to enforce its consent orders. In our most recent
comments to the Federal Trade Commissioner, we said simply ``The FTC
Must Enforce Existing Consent Orders.'' We wrote:
The effectiveness of FTC enforcement is determined by the
agency's willingness to enforce the legal judgments it obtains.
The FTC should review substantial changes in business practices
for companies under consent orders that implicate the privacy
interests of consumers. Multiple prominent Internet firms have
been permitted to alter business practices, without
consequence, despite being subject to 20-year consent orders
with the FTC. This has harmed consumers and promoted industry
disregard for the FTC.\29\

The Senate Commerce Committee should be specifically concerned
about the FTC's ongoing failure to enforce its consent orders. This
agency practice poses an ongoing risk to both American consumers and
American businesses.

This is in clear violation of the 2011 Consent Order, which states
that Facebook ``shall not misrepresent in any manner, expressly or by
implication . . . the extent to which [Facebook] makes or has made
covered information accessible to third parties; and the steps
[Facebook] takes or has taken to verify the privacy or security
protections that any third party provides.'' \33\ Part II of the
proposed order required Facebook to ``give its users a clear and
prominent notice and obtain their affirmative express consent before
sharing their previously-collected information with third parties in
any way that materially exceeds the restrictions imposed by their
privacy settings.'' \34\ Part IV ``requires Facebook to establish and
maintain a comprehensive privacy program that is reasonably designed
to: (1) Address privacy risks related to the development and management
of new and existing products and services, and (2) protect the privacy
and confidentiality of covered information. The privacy program must be
documented in writing and must contain controls and procedures

Response of EPIC and Consumer Privacy Organizations, Compliance with
GDPR
After the news broke of the Cambridge Analytica breach, EPIC and a
consumer coalition urged the FTC to reopen the Facebook
investigation.\36\ We stated, ``Facebook's admission that it disclosed
data to third parties without users' consent suggests a clear violation
of the 2011 Facebook Order.'' We further said:

Terrell McSweeney from leading consumer privacy organizations in the
United States (Mar. 20, 2018), https://epic.org/privacy/facebook/EPIC-

Urge FTC To Investigate Facebook'' (Mar. 20, 2018), https://epic.org/
2018/03/epic-consumer-groups-urge-ftc-.html.
The FTC has an obligation to the American public to ensure that
companies comply with existing Consent Orders. It is
unconscionable that the FTC allowed this unprecedented
disclosure of Americans' personal data to occur. The FTC's
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
failure to act imperils not only privacy but democracy as well.
On March 26, 2018, less than two weeks ago, the FTC announced it
would reopen the investigation.\37\ The Statement by the Acting
Director of FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection Regarding Reported
Concerns about Facebook Privacy Practice, issued on March 26, 2018, was
as follows:

Bureau of Consumer Protection Regarding Reported Concerns about
Facebook Privacy Practices (March 26, 2018), https://www.ftc.gov/news-

Facebook about 2011 Consent Order'' (Mar. 26, 2018), https://epic.org/
2018/03/ftc-confirms-investigation-int.html.
The FTC is firmly and fully committed to using all of its tools
to protect the privacy of consumers. Foremost among these tools
is enforcement action against companies that fail to honor
their privacy promises, including to comply with Privacy
Shield, or that engage in unfair acts that cause substantial
injury to consumers in violation of the FTC Act. Companies who
have settled previous FTC actions must also comply with FTC
order provisions imposing privacy and data security
requirements. Accordingly, the FTC takes very seriously recent
press reports raising substantial concerns about the privacy
practices of Facebook. Today, the FTC is confirming that it has
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
an open non-public investigation into these practices.
Congress should monitor this matter closely. This may be one of the
most consequential investigations currently underway in the Federal
Government.
But others are not waiting for the resolution. State Attorneys
General have also made clear their concerns about the Facebook
matter.\38\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Also today, a broad coalition of consumer organizations in the
United States and Europe, represented by the TransAtlantic Consumer
Dialogue (``TACD''), will urge Mr. Zuckerberg to make clear his
commitment to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation.
The TACD wrote:
The GDPR helps ensure that companies such as yours operate in
an accountable and transparent manner, subject to the rule of
law and the democratic process. The GDPR provides a solid
foundation for data protection, establishing clear
responsibilities for companies that collect personal data and
clear rights for users whose data is gathered. These are
protections that all users should be entitled to no matter
where they are located.\39\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\39\ Letter from TACD to Marck Zuckerberg, CEO, Facebook, Inc.,
Apr. 9, 2018, http://tacd.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/TACD-letter-
to-Mark-Zuckerberg_final.pdf.
EPIC supports the recommendation of TACD concerning the GDPR. There
is little reason that a U.S. firm should provide better privacy
protection to individuals outside the United States than it does to
those inside our country.
Oversight of the Federal Trade Commission and Facebook Compliance with
the 2011 Consent Order
Several former FTC commissioners and former FTC staff members have
recently suggested that the FTC needs more authority to protect
American consumers. At least with regard to enforcement of its current
legal authority, we strongly disagree. The FTC could have done far more
than it did.
On March 20, 2018, EPIC submitted a request to the FTC under the
Freedom of Information Act for the 2013, 2015, and 2017 Facebook
Assessments, as well as all records concerning the person(s) approved
by the FTC to undertake the Facebook Assessments; and all records of
communications between the FTC and Facebook regarding the Facebook
Assessments. In 2013, EPIC received redacted version of Facebook's
initial compliance report and first independent assessment after a
similar FOIA request.\40\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

13, 2012), http://epic.org/foia/FTC/facebook/EPIC-13-04-26-FTC-FOIA-

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Under the Final Consent Order, Facebook's initial assessment was
due to the FTC on April 13, 2013, and the subsequent reporting
deadlines were in 2015 and 2017. Cambridge Analytica engaged in the
illicit collection of Facebook user data from 2014 to 2016, encompassed
by the requested reporting period of the assessments.
We will keep both Committees informed of the progress of EPIC's
FOIA request for the FTC reports on Facebook compliance. We also urge
both Committees to pursue the public release of these documents. They
will provide for you a fuller pictures of the FTC's lack of response to
the looming privacy crisis in America.
Recommendations
There is a lot of work ahead to safeguard the personal data of
Americans. Here are a few preliminary recommendations:
Improve oversight of the Federal Trade Commission. The FTC
has failed to protect the privacy interests of American
consumer and the Commission's inaction contributed directly to
the Cambridge Analytica breach, and possibly the Brexit vote
and the outcome of the 2016 Presidential election. Oversight of
the Commission's failure to enforce the 2011 consent order is
critical, particularly for the Senate Commerce Committee which
also bears some responsibility for this outcome.
Update U.S. privacy laws. It goes without saying (though
obviously it still needs to be said) that U.S. privacy law is
out of date. There has always been a gap between changes in
technology and business practices and the development of new
privacy protections. But the gap today in the United States is
the greatest at any time since the emergence of modern privacy
law in the 1960s. The current approach is also unnecessarily
inefficient, complex, and ineffective. And many of the current
proposals, e.g., better privacy notices, would do little to
protect privacy or address the problems arising from Cambridge
Analytica debacle.
Establish a Federal privacy agency in the United States. The
U.S. is one of the few developed countries in the world without
a data protection agency. The practical consequence is that the
U.S consumers experience the highest levels of data breach,
financial fraud, and identity theft in the world. And U.S.
businesses, with their vast collections of personal data,
remain the target of cyber attack by criminals and foreign
adversaries. The longer the U.S. continues on this course, the
greater will be the threats to consumer privacy, democratic
institutions, and national security.
Conclusion
The transfer of 87 million user records to Cambridge Analytica
could have been avoided if the FTC had done its job. The 2011 Consent
Order against Facebook was issued to protect the privacy of user data.
If it had been enforced, there would be no need for the hearing this
week.
After the hearing with Mr. Zuckerberg this week, the Committees
should ask current and former FTC Commissioners and key staff, ``why
didn't you enforce the 2011 Consent Order against Facebook and prevent
this mess?'' \41\

Complaint, Request for Investigation, Injunction, and Other Relief
I. Introduction
1. This complaint concerns material changes to privacy settings
made by Facebook, the largest social network service in the United
States, which adversely impact users of the Facebook service.
Facebook's changes to users' privacy settings disclose personal
information to the public that was previously restricted. Facebook's
changes to users' privacy settings also disclose personal information
to third parties that was previously not available. These changes
violate user expectations, diminish user privacy, and contradict
Facebook's own representations. These business practices are Unfair and
Deceptive Trade Practices, subject to review by the Federal Trade
Commission (the ``Commission'') under section 5 of the Federal Trade
Commission Act.
2. These business practices impact more than 100 million users of
the social networking site who fall within the jurisdiction of the
United States Federal Trade Commission.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. EPIC urges the Commission to investigate Facebook, determine the
extent of the harm to consumer privacy and safety, require Facebook to
restore privacy settings that were previously available as detailed
below, require Facebook to give users meaningful control over personal
information, and seek appropriate injunctive and compensatory relief.
II. Parties
4. The Electronic Privacy Information Center (``EPIC'') is a not-
for-profit research center based in Washington, D.C. EPIC focuses on
emerging privacy and civil liberties issues and is a leading consumer
advocate before the Federal Trade Commission. Among its other
activities, EPIC first brought the Commission's attention to the
privacy risks of online advertising.\2\ In 2004, EPIC filed a complaint
with the FTC regarding the deceptive practices of data broker firm
Choicepoint, calling the Commission's attention to ``data products
circumvent[ing] the FCRA, giving businesses, private investigators, and
law enforcement access to data that previously had been subjected to
Fair Information Practices.'' \3\ As a result of the EPIC complaint,
the FTC fined Choicepoint $15 million.\4\ EPIC initiated the complaint
to the FTC regarding Microsoft Passport.\5\ The Commission subsequently
required Microsoft to implement a comprehensive information security
program for Passport and similar services.\6\ EPIC also filed a
complaint with the FTC regarding the marketing of amateur spyware,\7\
which resulted in the issuance of a permanent injunction barring sales
of CyberSpy's ``stalker spyware,'' over-the-counter surveillance
technology sold for individuals to spy on other individuals.\8\

5. Earlier this year, EPIC urged the FTC to undertake an
investigation of Google and cloud computing.\9\ The FTC agreed to
review the complaint, stating that it ``raises a number of concerns
about the privacy and security of information collected from consumers
online.'' \10\ More recently, EPIC asked the FTC to investigate the
``parental control'' software firm Echometrix.\11\ Thus far, the FTC
has failed to announce any action in this matter, but once the
Department of Defense became aware of the privacy and security risks to
military families, it removed Echometrix's software from the Army and
Air Force Exchange Service, the online shopping portal for military
families.\12\

6. The American Library Association is the oldest and largest
library association in the world, with more than 64,000 members. Its
mission is ``to provide leadership for the development, promotion, and
improvement of library and information services and the profession of
librarianship in order to enhance learning and ensure access to
information for all.''
7. The Center for Digital Democracy (``CDD'') is one of the leading
non-profit groups analyzing and addressing the impact of digital
marketing on privacy and consumer welfare. Based in Washington, D.C.,
CDD has played a key role promoting policy safeguards for interactive
marketing and data collection, including at the FTC and Congress.
8. Consumer Federation of America (``CFA'') is an association of
some 300 nonprofit consumer organizations across the U.S. CFA was
created in 1968 to advance the consumer interest through research,
advocacy, and education.
9. Patient Privacy Rights is a non-profit organization located in
Austin, Texas. Founded in 2004 by Dr. Deborah Peel, Patient Privacy
Rights is dedicated to ensuring Americans control all access to their
health records.
10. Privacy Activism is a nonprofit organization whose goal is to
enable people to make well-informed decisions about the importance of
privacy on both a personal and societal level. A key goal of the
organization is to inform the public about the importance of privacy
rights and the short-and long-term consequences of losing them, either
inadvertently, or by explicitly trading them away for perceived or ill-
understood notions of security and convenience.
11. The Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (``PRC'') is a nonprofit
consumer organization with a two-part mission--consumer information and
consumer advocacy. It was established in 1992 and is based in San
Diego, CA. Among its several goals, PRC works to raise consumers'
awareness of how technology affects personal privacy and to empower
consumers to take action to control their own personal information by
providing practical tips on privacy protection.
12. The U.S. Bill of Rights Foundation is a non-partisan public
interest law policy development and advocacy organization seeking
remedies at law and public policy improvements on targeted issues that
contravene the Bill of Rights and related Constitutional law. The
Foundation implements strategies to combat violations of individual
rights and civil liberties through Congressional and legal liaisons,
coalition building, message development, project planning &
preparation, tactical integration with supporting entities, and the
filings of complaints and of amicus curiae briefs in litigated matters.
13. Facebook Inc. was founded in 2004 and is based in Palo Alto,
California. Facebook's headquarters are located at 156 University
Avenue, Suite 300, Palo Alto, CA 94301. At all times material to this
complaint, Facebook's course of business, including the acts and
practices alleged herein, has been and is in or affecting commerce, as
``commerce'' is defined in Section 4 of the Federal Trade Commission
Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 45.
III. The Importance of Privacy Protection
14. The right of privacy is a personal and fundamental right in the
United States.\13\ The privacy of an individual is directly implicated
by the collection, use, and dissemination of personal information. The
opportunities to secure employment, insurance, and credit, to obtain
medical services and the rights of due process may be jeopardized by
the misuse of personal information.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ See Department of Justice v. Reporters Committee for Freedom
of the Press, 489 U.S. 749, 763 (1989) (``both the common law and the
literal understandings of privacy encompass the individual's control of
information concerning his or her person''); Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S.
589, 605 (1977); United States v. Katz, 389 U.S. 347 (1967); Olmstead
v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting).
\14\ Fed. Trade Comm'n, Consumer Sentinel Network Data Book 11
(2009) (charts describing how identity theft victims' information have
been misused).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
15. The excessive collection of personal data in the United States
coupled with inadequate legal and technological protections have led to
a dramatic increase in the crime of identity theft.\15\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\15\ Id. at 5 (from 2000-2009, the number of identity theft
complaints received increased from 31,140 to 313,982); see U.S. Gen.
Accounting Office, Identity Theft: Governments Have Acted to Protect
Personally Identifiable Information, but Vulnerabilities Remain 8
(2009); Fed. Trade Comm'n, Security in Numbers: SSNs and ID Theft 2
(2008).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
16. The Federal Government has established policies for privacy and
data collection on Federal websites that acknowledge particular privacy
concerns ``when uses of web technology can track the activities of
users over time and across different websites'' and has discouraged the
use of such techniques by Federal agencies.\16\

17. As the Supreme Court has made clear, and the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit has recently held, ``both the
common law and the literal understanding of privacy encompass the
individual's control of information concerning his or her person.''

18. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(``OECD'') Guidelines on the Protection of Privacy and Transborder
Flows of Personal Data recognize that ``the right of individuals to
access and challenge personal data is generally regarded as perhaps the
most important privacy protection safeguard.''
19. The appropriation tort recognizes the right of each person to
protect the commercial value of that person's name and likeness. The
tort is recognized in virtually every state in the United States.
20. The Madrid Privacy Declaration of November 2009 affirms that
privacy is a basic human right, notes that ``corporations are acquiring
vast amounts of personal data without independent oversight,'' and
highlights the critical role played by ``Fair Information Practices
that place obligations on those who collect and process personal
information and gives rights to those whose personal information is
collected.'' \18\

IV. Factual Background
Facebook's Size and Reach Is Unparalleled Among Social Networking Sites
22. Facebook is the largest social network service provider in the
United States. According to Facebook, there are more than 350 million
active users, with more than 100 million in the United States. More
than 35 million users update their statuses at least once each day.\20\

Facebook Has Previously Changed Its Service in Ways that Harm Users'
Privacy
25. In September 2006, Facebook disclosed users' personal
information, including details relating to their marital and dating
status, without their knowledge or consent through its ``News Feed''
program.\24\ Hundreds of thousands of users objected to Facebook's
actions.\25\ In response, Facebook stated:

34. Facebook now treats the following categories of personal data
as ``publicly available information:''
users' names,
profile photos,
lists of friends,
pages they are fans of,
gender,
geographic regions, and
networks to which they belong.\38\

36. Prior to these changes, only the following items were
mandatorily ``publicly available information:''
a user's name and
a user's network.
37. Users also had the option to include additional information in
their public search listing. as the screenshot of the original privacy
settings for search discovery demonstrates.

38. Facebook's original privacy policy stated that users ``may not
want everyone in the world to have the information you share on
Facebook'' as the screenshot below makes clear:

39. Facebook's Chief Privacy Officer, Chris Kelly, testified before
Congress that Facebook gives ``users controls over how they share their
personal information that model real-world information sharing and
provide them transparency about how we use their information in
advertising.'' \40\ Kelly further testified, ``many of our users choose
to limit what profile information is available to non-friends. Users
have extensive and precise controls available to choose who sees what
among their networks and friends, as well as tools that give them the
choice to make a limited set of information available to search engines
and other outside entities.'' \41\

46. Under the original privacy settings, users controlled public
access to the causes they supported. Under the revised settings,
Facebook has made users' causes ``publicly available information,''
disclosing this data to others and preventing users from exercising
control as they had under the original privacy policy.
47. Based on profile data obtained from Facebook users' friends
lists, MIT researchers found that ``just by looking at a person's
online friends, they could predict whether the person was gay.'' \46\
Under Facebook's original privacy policy, Facebook did not categorize
users' friends lists as ``publicly available information.'' Facebook
now makes users' friends lists ``publicly available information.''

Changes to Privacy Settings: Information Disclosure to Application
Developers
54. The Facebook Platform transfers Facebook users' personal data
to application developers without users' knowledge or consent.\52\

55. Facebook permits third-party applications to access user
information at the moment a user visits an application website.
According to Facebook, third party applications receive publicly
available information automatically when you visit them, and additional
information when you formally authorize or connect your Facebook
account with them.'' \53\

56. As Facebook itself explains in its documentation, when a user
adds an application, by default that application then gains access to
everything on Facebook that the user can see.\54\ The primary ``privacy
setting'' that Facebook demonstrates to third-party developers governs
what other users can see from the application's output, rather than
what data may be accessed by the application.\55\

picture, your gender, your birthday, your hometown location
(city/state/country), your current location (city/state/
country), your political view, your activities, your interests,
your musical preferences, television shows in which you are
interested, movies in which you are interested, books in which
you are interested, your favorite quotes, your relationship
status, your dating interests, your relationship interests,
your network affiliations, your education history, your work
history, your course information, copies of photos in your
photo albums, metadata associated with your photo albums (e.g.,
time of upload, album name, comments on your photos, etc.), the
total number of messages sent and/or received by you, the total
number of unread messages in your in-box, the total number of
``pokes'' you have sent and/or received, the total number of
wall posts on your Wall, a list of user IDs mapped to your
friends, your social timeline, notifications that you have
received from other applications, and events associated with
your profile.\56\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\56\ Facebook, About Platform, http://developers.facebook.com/

Application Programming Interface (``API''), to ``utiliz[e] profile,
friend, Page, group, photo, and event data.'' \57\ The API is a
collection of commands that an application can run on Facebook,
including authorization commands, data retrieval commands, and data

have gained access to information this way have considered the
``value'' of having the data, even when the data is not relevant to the
purpose for which the user has added the application.\61\

62. Under the revised privacy policy, Facebook now categorizes
users' names, profile photos, lists of friends, pages they are fans of,
gender, geographic regions, and networks to which they belong as
``publicly available information,'' and Facebooks sets the ``default
privacy setting for certain types of information [users] post on

64. With the Preferred Developer Program, Facebook will give third-
party developers access to a user's primary e-mail address, personal
information provided by the user to Facebook to subscribe to the
Facebook service, but not necessarily available to the public or to
developers.\64\ In fact, some users may choose to create a Facebook
account precisely to prevent the disclosure of their primary e-mail
address.

68. Under the revised settings, even when a user unchecks all boxes
and indicates that none of the personal information listed above should
be disclosed to third party application developers, Facebook states
that ``applications will always be able to access your publicly

users to opt out of disclosing all information to third parties through
the Facebook Platform.
71. Users can block individual third-party applications from
obtaining personal information by searching the Application Directory,
visiting the application's ``about'' page, clicking a small link on
that page, and then confirming their decision.\69\ A user would have to
perform these steps for each of more than 350,000 applications in order
to block all of them.\70\

trick me into loosening controls on my information. Though the
initial letter from Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg painted
the changes as pro-privacy. . .the actual effect of the
company's suggested new policy was to allow more public access
to information. Though the company has backtracked on some of
the changes, problems remain.\86\

result from the changes in Facebook's privacy settings. In early July,
TechCrunch, Jason Kincaid wrote:
Facebook clearly wants its users to become more comfortable
sharing their content across the web, because that's what needs
to happen if the site is going to take Twitter head-on with
real-time search capabilities Unfortunately that's far easier

trumpeted its granular privacy settings as one of its greatest
assets.\91\

privacy settings when Facebook disclosed his ``friends'' list to
critics, who republished the personal information. Salmon apologized to
his friends and denounced the Facebook ``Everyone'' setting:
I'm a semi-public figure, and although I might not be happy
with this kind of cyberstalking, I know I've put myself out
there and that there will be consequences of that. But that
decision of mine shouldn't have some kind of transitive
property which feeds through to my personal friends, and I
don't want the list of their names to be publicly available to
everyone.\97\

.html
By default, Facebook suggests sharing everything on your
profile to make it `easier for friends to find, identify and
learn about you.' It should read, `make it easier for anyone in
the world to find, identify and learn about you.' A little
creepier, sure, but this is part of Facebook's never-ending
struggle to be, essentially, more like Twitter. Thing is, a lot
of people like Facebook because it isn't like Twitter. Don't
mess with a good thing.\100\

91. Rob Pegoraro blogged on the Washington Post's ``Faster
Forward'' that the Facebook changes were ``more of a mess than I'd
expected.'' He criticized the revised ``Everyone'' privacy setting,
stating the change ``should never have happened. Both from a usability
and a PR perspective, the correct move would have been to leave users'
settings as they were, especially for those who had already switched
their options from the older defaults.''\101\

While Facebook users will be able to choose their privacy
settings, the problem is that most people don't take the time
to do so and may simply stick with the defaults. Others may
find the process confusing and may not understand how to adjust
those settings. Facebook said about one in five users currently

V. Legal Analysis
The FTC's Section 5 Authority
98. Facebook is engaging in unfair and deceptive acts and
practices.\110\ Such practices are prohibited by the FTC Act, and the
Commission is empowered to enforce the Act's prohibitions.\111\ These
powers are described in FTC Policy Statements on Deception \112\ and
Unfairness.\113\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\110\ See 15 U.S.C. Sec. 45.
\111\ Id.
\112\ Fed. Trade Comm'n, FTC Policy Statement on Deception (1983),
available at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/policystmt/ad-decept.htm
[hereinafter FTC Deception Policy].
\113\ Fed. Trade Comm'n, FTC Policy Statement on Unfairness (1980),
available at http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/policystmt/ad-unfair.htm
[hereinafter FTC Unfairness Policy].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
99. A trade practice is unfair if it ``causes or is likely to cause
substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by
consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to
consumers or to competition.'' \114\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\114\ 15 U.S.C. Sec. 45(n); see, e.g., Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Seismic
Entertainment Productions, Inc., Civ. No. 1:04-CV-00377 (Nov. 21, 2006)
(finding that unauthorized changes to users' computers that affected
the functionality of the computers as a result of Seismic's anti-
spyware software constituted a ``substantial injury without
countervailing benefits.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
100. The injury must be ``substantial.'' \115\ Typically, this
involves monetary harm, but may also include ``unwarranted health and
safety risks.'' \116\ Emotional harm and other ``more subjective types
of harm'' generally do not make a practice unfair.\117\ Secondly, the
injury ``must not be outweighed by an offsetting consumer or
competitive benefit that the sales practice also produces.'' \118\ Thus
the FTC will not find a practice unfair ``unless it is injurious in its
net effects.'' \119\ Finally, ``the injury must be one which consumers
could not reasonably have avoided.'' \120\ This factor is an effort to
ensure that consumer decision making still governs the market by
limiting the FTC to act in situations where seller behavior
``unreasonably creates or takes advantage of an obstacle to the free
exercise of consumer decisionmaking.'' \121\ Sellers may not withhold
from consumers important price or performance information, engage in
coercion, or unduly influence highly susceptible classes of
consumers.\122\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\115\ FTC Unfairness Policy, supra note 113.
\116\ Id.; see, e.g., Fed. Trade Comm'n v. Information Search,
Inc., Civ. No. 1:06-cv-01099 (Mar. 9, 2007) (``The invasion of privacy
and security resulting from obtaining and selling confidential customer
phone records without the consumers' authorization causes substantial
harm to consumers and the public, including, but not limited to,
endangering the health and safety of consumers.'').

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
101. The FTC will also look at ``whether the conduct violates
public policy as it has been established by statute, common law,
industry practice, or otherwise.'' \123\ Public policy is used to
``test the validity and strength of the evidence of consumer injury,
or, less often, it may be cited for a dispositive legislative or
judicial determination that such injury is present.'' \124\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\123\ Id.
\124\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
102. The FTC will make a finding of deception if there has been a
``representation, omission or practice that is likely to mislead the
consumer acting reasonably in the circumstances, to the consumer's
detriment.'' \125\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\125\ FTC Deception Policy, supra note 112.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
103. First, there must be a representation, omission, or practice
that is likely to mislead the consumer.\126\ The relevant inquiry for
this factor is not whether the act or practice actually misled the
consumer, but rather whether it is likely to mislead.\127\ Second, the
act or practice must be considered from the perspective of a reasonable
consumer.\128\ ``The test is whether the consumer's interpretation or
reaction is reasonable.'' \129\ The FTC will look at the totality of
the act or practice and ask questions such as ``how clear is the
representation? How conspicuous is any qualifying information? How
important is the omitted information? Do other sources for the omitted
information exist? How familiar is the public with the product or
service?'' \130\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\126\ FTC Deception Policy, supra note 112; see, e.g., Fed Trade
Comm'n v. Pantron I Corp., 33 F.3d 1088 (9th Cir. 1994) (holding that
Pantron's representation to consumers that a product was effective at
reducing hair loss was materially misleading, because according to
studies, the success of the product could only be attributed to a
placebo effect, rather than on scientific grounds).

\129\ Id.
\130\ Id.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
104. Finally, the representation, omission, or practice must be
material.\131\ Essentially, the information must be important to
consumers. The relevant question is whether consumers would have chosen
another product if the deception had not occurred.\132\ Express claims
will be presumed material.\133\ Materiality is presumed for claims and
omissions involving ``health, safety, or other areas with which the
reasonable consumer would be concerned.'' \134\ The harms of this
social networking site's practices are within the scope of the FTC's
authority to enforce Section 5 of the FTC Act and its purveyors should
face FTC action for these violations.

Material Changes to Privacy Practices and Misrepresentations of Privacy
Policies Constitute Consumer Harm
105. Facebook's actions injure users throughout the United States
by invading their privacy; allowing for disclosure and use of
information in ways and for purposes other than those consented to or
relied upon by such users; causing them to believe falsely that they
have full control over the use of their information; and undermining
the ability of users to avail themselves of the privacy protections
promised by the company.
106. The FTC Act empowers and directs the FTC to investigate
business practices, including data collection practices, that
constitute consumer harm.\135\ The Commission realizes the importance
of transparency and clarity in privacy policies. ``Without real
transparency, consumers cannot make informed decisions about how to
share their information.'' \136\

Protection, New York University: ``Promoting Consumer Privacy:
Accountability and Transparency in the Modern World'' (Oct. 2, 2009).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
107. The FTC recently found that Sears Holding Management
Corporations business practices violated the privacy of its
customers.\137\ The consent order arose from the company's use of
software to collect and disclose users' online activity to third
parties, and a misleading privacy policy that did not ``adequately
[inform consumers as to] the full extent of the information the
software tracked.'' \138\ The order requires that the company fully,
clearly, and prominently disclose the ``types of data the software will
monitor, record, or transmit.'' \139\ Further, the company must
disclose to consumers whether and how this information will be used by
third parties.\140\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
108. The Commission has also obtained a consent order against an
online company for changing its privacy policy in an unfair and
deceptive manner. In 2004, the FTC charged Gateway Learning Corporation
with making a material change to its privacy policy, allowing the
company to share users' information with third parties, without first
obtaining users' consent.\141\ This was the first enforcement action to
``challenge deceptive and unfair practices in connection with a
company's material change to its privacy policy.'' \142\ Gateway
Learning made representations on the site's privacy policy, stating
that consumer information would not be sold, rented or loaned to third
parties.\143\ In violation of these terms, the company began renting
personal information provided by consumers, including gender, age and
name, to third parties.\144\ Gateway then revised its privacy policy to
provide for the renting of consumer information ``from time to time,''
applying the policy retroactively.\145\ The settlement bars Gateway
Learning from, among other things, ``misrepresent[ing] in any manner,
expressly or by implication . . . the manner in which Respondent will
collect, use, or disclose personal information.'' \146\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
109. Furthermore, the FTC has barred deceptive claims about privacy
and security policies with respect to personally identifiable, or
sensitive, information.\147\ In 2008, the FTC issued an order
prohibiting Life is Good, Inc. from ``misrepresent[ing] in any manner,
expressly or by implication, the extent to which respondents maintain
and protect the privacy, confidentiality, or integrity of any personal
information collected from or about consumers.'' \148\ The company had
represented to its customers, ``we are committed to maintaining our
customers' privacy,'' when in fact, it did not have secure or adequate
measures of protecting personal information.\149\ The Commission
further ordered the company to establish comprehensive privacy
protection measures in relation to its customers' sensitive
information.\150\

Facebook's Revisions to the Privacy Settings Constitute an Unfair and

110. Facebook represented that users ``may not want everyone in the
world to have the information you share on Facebook,'' and that users
``have extensive and precise controls available to choose who sees what
among their network and friends, as well as tools that give them the
choice to make a limited set of information available to search engines
and other outside entities.'' \151\

111. Facebook's changes to users' privacy settings and associated

114. Facebook's representations regarding its changes to users'
privacy settings and associated policies are misleading and fail to
provide users clear and necessary privacy protections.
115. Wide opposition by users, commentators, and advocates to the
changes to Facebook's privacy settings and associated policies
illustrate that the changes injure Facebook users and harm the public
interest.
116. Absent injunctive relief by the Commission, Facebook is likely
to continue its unfair and deceptive business practices and harm the
public interest.
117. Absent injunctive relief by the Commission, the privacy
safeguards for consumers engaging in online commerce and new social
network services will be significantly diminished.
VI. Prayer for Investigation and Relief
118. EPIC requests that the Commission investigate Facebook, enjoin
its unfair and deceptive business practices, and require Facebook to
protect the privacy of Facebook users. Specifically, EPIC requests the
Commission to:
Compel Facebook to restore its previous privacy settings
allowing users to choose whether to publicly disclose personal
information, including name, current city, and friends;
Compel Facebook to restore its previous privacy setting
allowing users to fully opt out of revealing information to
third-party developers;
Compel Facebook to make its data collection practices clearer
and more comprehensible and to give Facebook users meaningful
control over personal information provided by Facebook to
advertisers and developers; and
Provide such other relief as the Commission finds necessary and
appropriate.
119. EPIC reserves the right to supplement this petition as other
information relevant to this proceeding becomes available.

Re: Committee Consideration of Facebook Data Compromises and Related
Issues
Dear Senators Grassley, Thune, Feinstein and Nelson:
ACM, the Association for Computing Machinery, is the world's
largest and oldest association of computing professionals representing
approximately 50,000 individuals in the United States and 100,000
worldwide. Its U.S. Public Policy Council (USACM) is charged with
providing policy and law makers throughout government with timely,
substantive and apolitical input on computing technology and the legal
and social issues to which it gives rise.
On behalf of USACM, thank you and the Committees for undertaking a
full and public exploration of the causes, scope, consequences and
implications of the enormous breaches of privacy and public trust
resulting from Facebook's and outside parties' use and misuse of vast
amounts of Facebook users' and millions of others' data. The technical
experts we represent--including luminaries in computer science,
engineering and other computing disciplines--stand ready to lend their
expertise to you and your staffs at any time as the hearing and
legislative processes progress.
USACM believes that the issues raised by this incident, and the
intense scrutiny now appropriately being brought to bear on it, make
this a watershed moment. The issue and challenge is not merely how to
address the failings of a single company, but to understand how privacy
and trust in an era of big data, pervasive networks and socially
embedded platforms must be addressed in order to promote the public
interest broadly in our society, including specifically the integrity
of our democratic institutions.
As your Committees prepare to convene, USACM offers the following
broad observations grounded in our technical understanding and
commitment to the highest ethical standards in our professional
practice:
It is critical to understand the full scale and consequences
of how Facebook's past and present business practices or
failures compromised, and may continue to undermine, users' and
others' privacy and data security. It is also critical,
however, to understand the technology underlying its actions
and omissions so that truly effective technical and legal means
may be designed to assure the protection of privacy by limiting
data collection and sharing, ensuring real user consent and
notice, and providing full transparency and accountability to
its community members. These and other fundamental principles
are detailed in USACM's 2018 Statement on the Importance of
Preserving Personal Privacy (attached);
The actions and omissions already confirmed or publicly
acknowledged to have occurred by Facebook appear to stem from
systemic deficiencies in a range of processes considered
essential by computing professionals, including proactive risk
assessment and management, as well as protecting security and
privacy by design;
Facebook's actions and omissions should be measured against
all appropriate ethical standards. The first principle of ACM's
long-established Code of Ethics states that, ``An essential aim
of computing professionals is to minimize negative consequences
of computing systems . . . and ensure that the products of
their efforts will be used in socially responsible ways.''
Adhering to broadly accepted social norms the ethical code also
requires that computing professionals ``avoid harm to others,''
where harm includes injury, negative consequences, or
undesirable loss of information or property.
The present controversy underscores that we are living in an
era of mega-scale data sets and once inconceivable
computational power. Consequently, the nature, scale, depth and
consequences of the data, technical and ethical breaches
understood to have occurred thus far in the Facebook case are
unlikely to be confined to a single company, technology or
industry. That argues strongly for Congress to comprehensively
revisit whether the public interest can adequately be protected
by current legal definitions of consent, the present scope of
Federal enforcement authority, and existing penalties for
breach of the public's privacy and trust on a massive scale;
and
Size and power are not the only consequential hallmarks of
the new information era. Ever more complicated and multiplying
synergies between technologies (such as platform architecture,
data aggregation, and micro-targeting algorithms) exponentially
increase the vulnerability of personal privacy. Similarly
increasing complexity in the ways that social media continues
to be woven into modern life amplifies the threat. Together
these trends make it clear that addressing separate elements of
this rapidly changing ecosystem in isolation is no longer a
viable means of protecting the public interest. Rather, we urge
Congress to consider new and holistic ways of conceptualizing
privacy and its protection.
Thank you again for your work at this pivotal time and for formally
including this correspondence and the attached Statement in the record
of your upcoming hearing. USACM looks forward to assisting you and your
staffs in the future. To arrange a technical briefing, or should you
have any other questions, please contact ACM's Director of Global
Public Policy, Adam Eisgrau, at [email protected]
Sincerely,
Stuart Shapiro,
Chair.

USACM Statement on the Importance of Preserving Personal Privacy
USACM believes that the benefits of emerging technologies, such as
Big Data and the Internet of Things, should and need not come at the
expense of personal privacy. It is hoped and intended that the
principles and practices set out in this Statement will provide a basis
for building data privacy into modern technological systems. USACM
encourages the development of innovative solutions to achieve these
goals.
Foundational Privacy Principles and Practices
Fairness
An automated system should not produce an adverse decision
about an individual without the individual's full knowledge of
the factors that produced that outcome.
Transparency
Provide individuals with clear information about how and by
whom their personal data is being collected, how it will be
used, how long it will be retained, to whom it may be disclosed
and why, how individuals may access and modify their own data,
and the process for reporting complaints or updates.
Where feasible, provide these details prior to data
collection and creation.
Ensure that communications with individuals (i.e., data
subjects) are comprehensible, readable, and straightforward.
Collection Limitation and Minimization
Collect and retain personal data only when strictly
necessary to provide the service or product to which the data
relates, or to achieve a legitimate societal objective.
Minimize the identifiability of personal data by avoiding
the collection of individual-level data when feasible, and
taking into account the risk of correlation across data sets to
re-identify individuals.
Individual Control
In all circumstances, consent to acquisition and use of an
individual's data should be meaningful and fully informed.
Provide individuals with the ability to limit the
collection, creation, retention, sharing and transfer of their
personal data.
Ensure that individuals are able to prevent personal data
obtained for one purpose from being used or made available for
other purposes without that person's informed consent.
Provide individuals with the ability to access and correct
their personal data.
Data Integrity and Quality
Ensure that personal data, including back-up and copies
forwarded to third parties, is sufficiently accurate, current,
and complete for the purpose for which it is to be used.
Conduct appropriate data quality assessments.
Data Security
Protect personal data against loss, misuse, unauthorized
disclosure, and improper alteration.
Audit access, use, and maintenance of personal data.
Data Retention and Disposal
Establish clear policies with fixed publicly stated
retention periods and seek individuals' affirmative consent to
retain their data for longer periods.
Store personal data only for as long as needed to serve the
stated purpose for its initial collection.
Where feasible, de-identify personal information until
properly destroyed.
Implement mechanisms to promptly destroy unneeded or expired
personal data, including back-up data and information shared
with third parties.
Privacy Enhancement
Promote and implement techniques that minimize or eliminate
the collection of personal data.
Promote and implement techniques that ensure compliance with
the best privacy practices as they evolve.
Management and Accountability
Ensure compliance with privacy practices through appropriate
mechanisms, including independent audits.
Establish and routinely test the capability to address a
privacy breach or other incident.
Implement privacy and security training and awareness
programs.
Risk Management
Routinely assess privacy risks to individuals across the
data life cycle using appropriate risk models.

NetChoice Comments for the Record for Joint Senate Judiciary and Senate
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation Hearing: Facebook,
Social Media Privacy, and the Use and Abuse of Data
NetChoice respectfully submits the following comments for the
record regarding the Joint Senate Judiciary and Senate Committee on
Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearing: Facebook, Social Media
Privacy, and the Use and Abuse of Data.
NetChoice is a trade association of leading e-commerce and online
companies. We work to promote the integrity and availability of the
global Internet and are significantly engaged in privacy issues in the
states, in Washington, and in international Internet governance
organizations.
Through these comments we seek to clarify the potential harm to
America's businesses from aggressive laws and regulations on online
platforms. For example, taking a European approach \1\ on interest-
based ads would cost American businesses $340 billion over the next
five years. Consumers would also have a worse user experience
accompanied with less relevant advertising.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ See, European Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive
2002/58/EC.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Likewise, limitations on large online platforms will impact the
small and mid-size businesses who rely on the size and scope of these
platforms to reach customers and grow their business.
Eliminating interest-based ads by default will cost American
businesses and make it harder for Americans to access content
Calls to limit or eliminate interest-based ads by default, like the
BROWSER Act,\2\ would erase up to $340 billion in advertising revenue
from American websites over the next five years.\3\ This means
potentially less content, more ads, and/or more paywalls.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Balancing the Rights of Web Surfers Equally and Responsibly Act
of 2017, H. R. 2520 (May 18, 2018).
\3\ See Analysis at https://netchoice.org/library/loss-of-340-
billion/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Requiring users to opt-in to interest-based advertising and studies
have shown that such an opt-in regime reduces online ads' effectiveness
by 65 percent. This precipitous drop in ad effectiveness means a
likewise drop in revenue for American businesses and a worse user
experience.
There is an old adage:
``Half the money spent on advertisements is wasted, I just
don't know which half.''
This quote represents a problem from a by-gone era where only mass-
media advertisements were really possible--think TV commercials, radio
spots, and newspaper ads. With these ads, the likelihood that the
viewer is interested in the ad is likely low resulting in inefficient
advertising expenses.
Conversely, interest-based ads enable small businesses to better
spend their limited advertising dollars. Studies have shown that
interest-based advertisements are 65 percent more effective than
contextual ads.\4\ Interest-based ads help small businesses show
potential customers products they actually want and allows small
businesses to use more money to grow their business and hire new
employees.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ Goldfarb & Tucker, Privacy Regulation and Online Advertising,
Univ. Toronto & MIT (Aug-2010)--finding that online ad effectiveness
fell by 65 percent under the EU opt-in regime covering 3.3 million EU
citizens.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Taking actions to return to the old-school advertising model will
fall hard on for small businesses.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
It's not just American businesses that lose with such restrictions,
but also American consumers visiting websites. Because of $340 billion
price tag for such advertising restrictions, we'll see one or more of
these consequences:
Websites will show more ads to make up lost revenue.
Websites will have less to spend on reporters, content,
services, and innovation.
Some websites will erect paywalls for content that users get
for free today.
These consequences are bad for American consumers, and especially
harmful for low-income households that can't afford to pay for online
services.
America's small businesses and organizations rely on online platforms
Erasing $340 billion of revenue from American websites hits small
businesses and small organizations the hardest, since they depend on
low-cost and effective interest-based advertising to reach new
customers and engage with existing ones. This connection is especially
important for small and mid-size businesses who may have neither the
name recognition nor the funds to afford traditional advertising.
Think back twenty years ago, when new businesses spread the word
through expensive broadcast and newspaper advertising and direct mail
campaigns. This was costly and not particularly effective, since
advertisers were unable to effectively target viewers and households
who had an interest in their products.
But online platforms have revolutionized advertising for small
businesses and non-profit organizations. Using online platforms, small
businesses now connect with potential customers at a fraction of the
cost they would have historically paid.
National advertising used to be restricted to all but the
wealthiest companies. Using online platforms, now any business of any
size can advertise across the country. Of course, the larger the
platform, the easier it is for America's small businesses to connect
with those most likely to be interested.
A recent survey by Morning Consult \5\ found that:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Examining the Impact of Technology on Small Businesses,
available at https://www.uscham
ber.com/sites/default/files/ctec_sme-rpt_v3.pdf
84 percent of small enterprises use at least one major
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
digital platform to provide information to customers
70 percent of small businesses said that Facebook helps them
attract new customers
There are many examples of small businesses leveraging online
platforms in every part of America.
All Things Real Estate in Portland, OR
For a couple of dollars, this small business can reach their
target audience with ads. The female-owned business used
Facebook to increase sales by 500 percent in less than 10
months by connecting with likely customers.
Owner Tracey Hicks said, ``Many of our customers tell us they
saw our ads on Facebook or saw another realtor wearing our
products and ask us for the same. If it wasn't for our Facebook
ads we wouldn't be as big as we are now.''
CandyLipz LLC. in San Francisco, CA
Facing declining revenue, owner Thienna Ho turned to online
platforms to help her businesses. As a result, she has grown
her business from three to fifteen employees in 15 months.
Lost Cabin Beer Co. in Rapid City, SD
Realizing that legacy media was cost-prohibitive and
ineffective, this small beverage company leveraged online
platforms to find customers and grow their business.
Sons & Daughters Farm and Winery, West Palm Beach, FL
Following Hurricane Katrina, this family farm was decimated.
Using online platforms, this small family business was able to
reinvigorate their wine business and is now also hosting
parties and weddings at their farm.
Platforms also help smaller enterprises to find new employees and
help job-seekers to find work. Large online platforms like LinkedIn and
ZipRecruiter rely on their large platforms to quickly connect employers
with ideal candidates.
With over 8 million job listings and over 7 million active job
seekers each month, ZipRecruiter connects 80 percent of employers with
quality candidates within 24 hours.\6\ Of course, the larger the
platform, the easier it is for businesses and potential employees to
connect.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ See, e.g., About Us--Ziprecruiter, https://
www.ziprecruiter.com/about.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Online platforms are already subject to hundreds of laws and
regulations
Today, every online platform is subject to multiple laws and
regulations, including 47 state laws regarding data breaches and over a
hundred state and Federal privacy laws and regulations.
Take for example Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission
(``FTC'') Act, which prohibits ``unfair or deceptive trade practices.''
\7\ This broad enforcement power enables the FTC to take action against
online platforms that fail to honor their terms-of-service or privacy
promises.\8\ Likewise, the FTC has used its unfairness enforcement
power to take action against businesses that fail to adequately protect
data.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ Federal Trade Commission Act, 15 USC Sec. 45 (``FTC Act''),
``The Commission is hereby empowered and directed to prevent [use of]
unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce and unfair or
deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.''
\8\ See, e.g., In the Matter of Nomi Technologies, Inc., Matter No.
1323251 (Apr. 2015). The FTC found that a technical error in Nomi's
privacy policy was enough for an enforcement action even though the FTC
couldn't show a single consumer misunderstood or suffered any harm.
\9\ See In the Matter of ASUSTeK Computer, Inc., Complaint, FTC
Dkt. No. C-4587 (July 18, 2016) (company's cloud storage service,
offered in connection with sale of Internet routers, was allegedly
insecure).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, Section 5 of the FTC Act is enforceable by the Federal
Trade Commission and by every state Attorney General under the ``little
Section 5'' authority.
Other laws which regulate online platforms include, the Children's
Online Privacy Protection Act,\10\ California's Online Privacy
Protection Act,\11\ California's Privacy Rights for California Minors
in the Digital World Act,\12\ Delaware's Online and Personal Privacy
Protection,\13\ and the Pennsylvania Deceptive or fraudulent business
practices law,\14\ to name a few.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\10\ 15 U.S.C. 6501-6505
\11\ Calif. Bus. & Prof. Code Sec. Sec. 22575-22578
\12\ Calif. Bus. & Prof. Code Sec. Sec. 22580-22582
\13\ Del. Code Sec. 19-7-705
\14\ 18 Pa. C.S.A. Sec. 4107(a)(10)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clearly, the suggestion that ``internet platforms are unregulated''
is inaccurate.
Role for Government
The role for government should be where consumers cannot adequately
act to protect their privacy interests, through choices they alone can
make. Government should use its powers to pursue online fraud and
criminal misuse of data, not to create rules that narrowly prescribe
how data should be used.
Overall, we support the notion that businesses and customers--not
governments--must take the lead on data privacy. Businesses need to
pursue innovation without repeatedly asking for permission from
government agencies. And consumers must understand the decisions they
make and must be allowed to make those decisions.
We offer this conceptual view of an industry self-regulatory
framework that dynamically adapts to new technologies and services,
encourages participation, and enhances compliance.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
As seen in the conceptual overview, components of the Privacy Bill
of Rights form the aspirational core that influences business conduct
regarding data privacy. From previous work by the FTC, NAI, and IAB,
we've established the foundational principles for the collection and
use of personal information: individual control, transparency, respect
for context, access and accuracy, focused collection, accountability,
and security.
Participating companies would publicly attest to implement Codes
within their business operations, including periodic compliance
reviews. If a company failed to comply with the adopted Codes, the FTC
and state Attorneys General could bring enforcement actions, as is
currently the case when companies fail to honor their adopted privacy
policies.
We thank the Joint Committees for giving us the opportunity to
present our concerns and look forward to further discussions about this
important topic.
Sincerely,
Carl Szabo,
Vice President and General Counsel,
NetChoice.

Chairman,
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
Washington, DC.
Hon. Dianne Feinstein,
Ranking Member,

Hon. Bill Nelson,
Ranking Member,
Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
Washington, DC.
Dear Chairmen Grassley and Thune and Ranking Members Feinstein and
Nelson,
On behalf of Public Knowledge, a public interest advocacy
organization dedicated to promoting freedom of expression, an open
internet, and access to affordable communications tools and creative
works, we applaud the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the Senate
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation for holding a
hearing on ``Facebook, Social Media Privacy, and the Use and Abuse of
Data.'' We appreciate the opportunity to submit this letter for the
record.
The Facebook disclosures over the last several weeks have been
unrelenting. First, we learned that an app developer, Aleksandr Kogan,
funneled personal information about at least 87 million Facebook users
to Cambridge Analytica, a firm that purported to engage in
``psychographics'' to influence voters on behalf of the Trump campaign.
Gallingly, as was Facebook's practice for all apps at that time, when
users connected Kogan's app to their Facebook accounts, the app scooped
up not only the users' personal information, but also their friends'
information--without any notice to the friends or opportunity for the
friends to consent. We then learned that Facebook had been collecting
Android users' SMS and call histories. While Android users may have
technically consented to that data collection, the outrage this news
provoked strongly suggests that the notice Facebook provided about the
practice was insufficient to permit users to understand precisely to
what they were consenting. Last week, we learned that ``malicious
actors'' used Facebook's search tools to build profiles of individuals
whose e-mail addresses and phone numbers had been stolen in data
breaches over the years and posted on the dark web. These profiles
enabled identity theft.
But Facebook is hardly unique. In the twenty-first century, it is
impossible to meaningfully participate in society without sharing our
personal information with third parties. We increasingly live our lives
online. We turn to platforms and companies to access education, health
care, employment, the news, and emergency communications. We shop
online. When we seek to rent a new apartment, buy a home, open a credit
card, or, sometimes, apply for a job, someone checks our credit scores
through companies on the internet. These third party companies and
platforms should have commensurate obligations to protect our personal
information, and those obligations must have the force of law.
Unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear that too many third
parties fail to live up to this responsibility. Rather, unauthorized
access to personal data has run rampant--whether it is in the form of
Cambridge Analytica, where authorized access to data was misused and
shared in ways that exceeded authorization, or in the form of a data
breach, where information was accessed in an unauthorized way. Just
since the Cambridge Analytica news broke, consumers have learned of
data breaches at Orbitz, Under Armour, Lord and Taylor, Saks Fifth
Avenue, Saks Off Fifth, Panera Bread, Sears Holding Corp., and Delta
Airlines.
We have also learned about purportedly authorized access to data
that many consumers find unsavory and would likely not consent to, if
they were clearly and fully informed of the nature of the transaction.
For example, last week, we learned that Grindr has been sharing its
users' HIV status with two other companies, Apptimize and Localystics.
This sharing is almost certainly disclosed in Grindr's terms of
service, but it is well known that few people read terms of service,
and there is good reason to believe that had Grindr been upfront about
this data sharing practices, few of its users would have agreed to it.
The industry has long insisted that it can regulate itself.
However, the deluge of data breaches and unauthorized and unsavory use
of consumer data makes clear that self-regulation is insufficient.
Indeed, Facebook was already under a consent decree with the Federal
Trade Commission (FTC), and yet it still failed to protect its users'
personal information.
This hearing is a good start to begin addressing corporate
collection and use of user data in the modern economy. But, a hearing
alone is not enough. We hope that the Committees will use this hearing
to build the record for strong, comprehensive privacy legislation. Here
are three elements that any privacy legislation should include:
Notice and Consent
Until the digital age, individual ownership and control of one's
own personal information was the basis for privacy law in the United
States.\1\ We should return to this principle. While we cannot avoid
sharing information with some third parties, we can have greater
control over that information. At a minimum, consumers should have a
right to know a) what information is being collected and retained about
them; b) how long that information is being retained; c) for what
purposes that information is being retained; d) whether the retained
information is identifiable, pseudo-anonymized, or anonymized; e)
whether and how that information is being used; f) with whom that
information is being shared; g) for what purposes that information is
being shared; h) under what rubric that information is being shared
(for free, in exchange for compensation, subject to a probable cause
warrant, etc.); and (i) whether such information is being protected
with industry recognized best practices.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Harold Feld, Principles for Privacy Legislation: Putting People
Back in Control of Their Information 19-20 (Public Knowledge, 2017).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is imperative that this notice be meaningful and effective,
which means that it cannot be buried in the fine print of a lengthy
privacy policy or terms of service agreement. Consumers and companies
know that consumers do not typically read privacy policies or terms of
service agreements. Indeed, researchers at Carnegie Mellon estimate
that it would take seventy-six work days for an individual to read all
of the privacy policies she encounters in a year.\2\ Companies take
advantage of this common knowledge to bury provisions that they know
consumers are unlikely to agree to in the fine print of these
agreements. While courts have found these agreements to be binding
contract, there is no reason that Congress cannot undo this presumption
and insist that notice be provided in a way that consumers can quickly
read and understand.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Alexis C. Madrigal, Reading the Privacy Policies you Encounter
in a Year Would Take 76 Work Days, The Atlantic, Mar. 1, 2012, https://
www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/03/reading-the-privacy-
policies-you-encounter-in-a-year-would-take-76-work-days/253851/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Moreover, notice alone is insufficient. Consumers must also have
meaningful opportunities to freely and affirmatively consent to data
collection, retention, and sharing. And, that consent should be as
granular as possible. For example, a user should be able to consent for
her data to be used for research purposes, but not for targeted
advertising--or vice-versa. As with notice, the consent must be real
rather than implied in the fine print of a terms of service. Consumers
must also have the ability to withdraw their consent if they no longer
wish for a company to use and retain their personal data, and they
should be able to port their data in a machine-readable format to
another service, if they so desire. In addition, service should not be
contingent on the sharing of data that is not necessary to render the
service.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ While it may be appropriate for a non-essential service like
Facebook to charge users a fee in lieu of selling their data, see Alex
Johnson and Erik Ortiz, Without data-targeted ads, Facebook would look
like a pay service, Sandberg says, NBC News, Apr. 5, 2018, https://
www.nbcnews.com/tech/social-media/users-would-have-pay-opt-out-all-
facebook-ads-sheryl-n863151, such an approach is unacceptable for
services that are integral for participation in society. Individuals
should be able to access health care, education, housing, and other
essential services without compromising their personal information or
having to pay extra for their fundamental right to privacy.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The General Data Protection Regulation, which goes into effect in
Europe in May, will require some kinds of granular notice and consent,
so companies already have to figure out how to offer their users
opportunities for meaningful consent. There is no reason for them not
to offer the same opportunities for meaningful notice and consent in
the United States.
Security Standards
Organizations that are stewards of our personal information should
be expected to adhere to recognized best practices to secure the
information. This is particularly true when an individual cannot avoid
sharing the information without foregoing critical services or
declining to participate in modern society.
Relatedly, organizations should be required to adhere to privacy by
design and by default and to practice data minimization. The
presumption should be that only data necessary for the requested
transaction will be retained, absent explicit consumer consent.
Organizations should be encouraged to employ encryption, pseudo-
anonymization, and anonymization to protect consumers' private
information, and security mechanisms should be regularly evaluated.
Importantly, these evaluations must be publicly conducted, with the
government acting as convener of any multi-stakeholder process.
Facebook/Cambridge Analytica, as well as the cascade of recent data
breaches, has demonstrated that industry cannot be trusted to police
itself.
Meaningful Recourse
When there is unauthorized access to personal information,
individuals must be made whole to the greatest extent possible. There
are two major barriers to this. The first is the Federal Arbitration
Act, which requires courts to honor the forced arbitration clauses in
contracts, including forced arbitration clauses buried in the fine
print of terms of service agreements. Forced arbitration clauses
require consumers to settle any dispute they have with a company by
arbitration rather than having their day in court--and often consumers
do not even know an arbitration clause is in their contract until they
go to sue. This presents three problems: (1) Arbitrators are often more
sympathetic to large companies, who are repeat players in the
arbitration system, than most juries would be. (2) Arbitration creates
no legal precedent. (3) Frequently, it is not cost-effective for an
individual to bring a claim against a large company by herself. The
damages she could win likely would not exceed her legal costs. But,
when customers can band together in a class action lawsuit, it becomes
much more feasible to bring a case against a large company engaged in
bad behavior. Forced arbitration clauses preclude class action.
Congress should explicitly exempt cases addressing the failure to
protect personal information from the Federal Arbitration Act to make
sure consumers can have their day in court when their information is
misused and their trust abused.
The other major barrier to meaningful recourse is the difficulty
calculating the damages associated with unauthorized access to personal
information. While one may be able to quantify her damages when her
credit card information is breached or her identity is stolen, it is
much harder to do so in a situation like Facebook/Cambridge Analytica.
It is difficult to put a dollar amount on having one's privacy
preferences ignored or her personal information revealed to third
parties without her knowledge or consent. We instinctively know that
there is harm in having one's personal data used for ``psychographics''
to influence her behavior in the voting booth, but that harm is
difficult to quantify. Congress already uses liquidated damages in
other situations when the damage is real, but hard to quantify. In
fact, liquidated damages are already used to address other privacy
harms. For example, the Cable Privacy Act provides for liquidated
damages when cable companies impermissibly share or retain personally
identifiable information.
While the FTC can step in when companies engage in unfair and
deceptive practices, the FTC is likely to only intervene in the most
egregious cases. Moreover, the FTC can only extract damages from
companies once they have violated users' privacy once, entered into a
consent decree with the Agency, and then violated the consent decree.
That means a lot of consumers have to have their personal information
abused before a company is held to account. Moreover, when the FTC is
involved, any damages go to the government, not to making individuals
whole.
We are not recommending that the FTC be taken out of the business
of protecting consumers in the digital age, but merely suggesting that
consumers should also have the opportunity to protect ourselves.
Allowing private, class action lawsuits for liquidated damages when
companies fail to safeguard private information will create the
necessary incentives for companies to take appropriate precautions to
protect the information they have been entrusted with. Companies, after
all, understand the technology and the risks, and are in the best
position to develop safeguards to protect consumers.
Existing Laws and Legislation
While we hope that Congress will use this hearing to build the
record for comprehensive privacy legislation, we encourage Congress to
enact legislation that is compatible with existing Federal sector-
specific privacy laws in communications, health care, finance, and
other sectors, as well as with state and local privacy laws. While the
Federal Government should set minimum standards of protection for all
Americans, states have been in the vanguard of privacy protection and
are much-needed ``cops on the beat.'' Even if Congress were to
dramatically expand the resources available to Federal privacy
agencies, the Federal Government could not hope to provide adequate
protection to consumers on its own. Rather, the states, as laboratories
of democracy, should be empowered to innovate and provide greater
privacy protections to their residents.
These sector-specific privacy laws and state privacy laws, as well
as legislation, introduced in this Congress and in previous Congresses,
addressing notice and consent, security requirements, data breaches,
and/or forced arbitration may be good building blocks for comprehensive
legislation. But, Congress must ensure that the bills are updated to
address today's harms. For example, many of the bills that have been
drafted narrowly define personal information to include identifiers
like first and last name, social security numbers, bank account
numbers, etc. These bills would not personal cover the personal
information in question in Facebook/Cambridge Analytica--information
like social media ``likes'' that is certainly useful for influencing an
individual in the voting booth, as well as for more mundane marketing
and advertising purposes, and that, when aggregated, may, in fact, be
personally identifiable.
Conclusion
Again, we appreciate the opportunity to submit this letter for the
record for the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the Senate
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation hearing on

Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Whitehouse.
STATEMENT OF HON. SHELDON WHITEHOUSE,
U.S. SENATOR FROM RHODE ISLAND
Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I want to correct
one thing that I said earlier in response to a question from
Senator Leahy. He had asked why we did not ban Cambridge
Analytica at the time when we learned about them in 2015, and I
answered that what my understanding was was that they were not
on the platform or not an app developer or advertiser. When I
went back and met with my team afterwards, they let me know
that Cambridge Analytica actually did start as an advertiser
later in 2015, so we could have in theory banned them then. We
made a mistake by not doing so, but I just wanted to make sure
that I updated that because I misspoke or got that wrong
earlier.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Whitehouse.
Senator Whitehouse. Thank you, Chairman. Welcome back, Mr.
Zuckerberg.
On the subject of bans, I just wanted to explore a little
bit what these bans mean. Obviously, Facebook has been done
considerable reputational damage by its association with
Aleksandr Kogan and with Cambridge Analytica, which is one of
the reasons you are having this enjoyable afternoon with us.
Your testimony says that Aleksandr Kogan's app has been banned.
Has he also been banned?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, my understanding is he has.
Senator Whitehouse. So if he were to open up another
account under a name and you were able to find it out, that
would be closed down?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I believe we are preventing him
from building any more apps.
Senator Whitehouse. Does he have a Facebook account still?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I believe the answer to that is
no, but I can follow up with you afterwards.
[The information referred to follows:]
Does Kogan still have an account?
Kogan's personal accounts have been suspended, as have the personal
accounts of some Cambridge Analytica officers.
Senator Whitehouse. OK. And with respect to Cambridge
Analytica, your testimony is that, first, you would require
them to formally certify that they had deleted all improperly
acquired data. Where did that formal certification take place?
That sounds kind of like a quasi-official thing to formally
certify. What did that entail?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, first, they sent us an e-mail
notice from their chief data officer telling us that they did
not have any of the data anymore, that they deleted it and were
not using it, and then later, we followed up with I believe a
full legal contract where they certified that they had deleted
the data.
Senator Whitehouse. In a legal contract?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, I believe so.
Senator Whitehouse. OK. And then you ultimately said that
you have banned Cambridge Analytica. Who exactly is banned?
What if they opened up Cranston, Rhode Island, Analytica,
different corporate forum, same enterprise? Would that
enterprise also be banned?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, that is certainly the intent.
Cambridge Analytica actually has a parent company, and we
banned the parent company, and, recently, we also banned a firm
called AIQ, which I think is also associated with them. And if
we find other firms that are associated with them, we will
block them from the platform as well.
Senator Whitehouse. Are individual principals, p-a-l-s,
principals of the firm also banned?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, my understanding is we are
blocking them from doing business on the platform, but I do not
believe that we are blocking people's personal accounts.
Senator Whitehouse. OK. Can any customer amend your terms
of service or is the terms of service a take-it-or-leave-it
proposition for the average customer?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think the terms of service are
what they are, but the service is really defined by people
because you get to choose what information you share. You know,
the whole service is about which friends you connect to, which
people you choose to----
Senator Whitehouse. Yes, I guess----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--connect to----
Senator Whitehouse.--my question would relate to--Senator
Graham held up that big fat document. It is easy to put a lot
of things buried in a document that then later turn out to be
of consequence, and all I wanted to establish with you is that
that document that Senator Graham held up, that is not a
negotiable thing with individual customers? That is a take-it-
or-leave-it proposition for your customers to sign up to or not
use the service?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, that is right on the terms of
service----
Senator Whitehouse. Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--although we offer a lot of controls so
people can configure the experience how they want.
Senator Whitehouse. So last question on a different subject
having to do with the authorization process that you are
undertaking for entities that are putting up political content
or so-called issue ad content. You said that they will have to
go through an authorization process before they do it. You
said, ``Here, we will be verifying the identity.'' How do you
look behind a shell corporation and find who is really behind
it through your authorization process? Well, step back. Do you
need to look behind shell corporations in order to find out who
is really behind the content that is being posted? And if you
may need to look behind a shell corporation, how will you go
about doing that? How will you get back to the true what
lawyers would call beneficial owner of the site that is putting
out the political material?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, are you referring to the
verification of political and issue ads?
Senator Whitehouse. Yes, and before that, political ads,
yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes. So what we are going to do is require
a valid government identity, and we are going to verify the
location. So we are going to do that so that way someone
sitting in Russia, for example, could not say that they are in
America and therefore able to run an election ad.
Senator Whitehouse. But if they were running through a
corporation domiciled in Delaware, you would not know that they
were actually a Russian owner?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, that is correct.
Senator Whitehouse. OK. Thank you. My time is expired, and
I appreciate the courtesy of the chair for the extra seconds.
Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Lee.
STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE,
U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH
Senator Lee. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg, I wanted to follow up on a statement that
you made shortly before the break just a few minutes ago. You
said that there are some categories of speech, some types of
content that Facebook would never want to have any part of and
it takes active steps to avoid disseminating, putting hate
speech, nudity, racist speech. I assume you also meant
terrorist acts, threats of physical violence, things like that.
Beyond that, would you agree that Facebook ought not be putting
its thumb on the scale with regard to the content of speech,
assuming it fits out of one of those categories that is
prohibited?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes. There are generally two
categories of content that we are very worried about. One are
things that could cause real-world harm, so terrorism certainly
fits into that, self-harm fits into that. I would consider
election interference to fit into that. And those are the types
of things that we--I do not really consider there to be much
discussion around whether those are good or bad topics.
Senator Lee. Sure. Yes, and I am not disputing that. What I
am asking is once you get beyond those categories of things
that are prohibited and should be, is it Facebook's position
that it should not be putting its thumb on the scale? It should
not be favoring or disfavoring speech based on its content
based on the viewpoint of that speech?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, in general that is our position.
One of the things that is really important, though, is that in
order to create a service where everyone has a voice, we also
need to make sure that people are not bullied or basically
intimidated or the environment feels unsafe for them.
Senator Lee. OK. So when you say in general, that is the
exception that you are referring to, the exception being that
if someone feels bullied, even if it is not a terrorist act,
nudity, terrorist threats, racist speech, or something like
that, you might step in there. Beyond that, would you step in
and put your thumb on the scale as far as the viewpoint of the
content being posted?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, no. I mean, in general, our goal
is to allow people to have as much expression as possible.
Senator Lee. OK. So subject to the exceptions we have
discussed you would stay out of that.
Let me ask you this: Is there not a significant free market
incentive that a social media company, including yours, has in
order to safeguard the data of their users? Do you not have
free market incentives in that respect?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes. Senator, yes.
Senator Lee. Do your interests not align with those of us
here who want to see data safeguarded?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Absolutely.
Senator Lee. Do you have the technological means available
at your disposal to make sure that that does not happen and to
protect, say, an app developer from transferring Facebook data
to a third party?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, a lot of that we do, and some of
that happens outside of our systems and will require new
measures. So, for example, what we saw here was people chose to
share information with an app developer. That worked according
to how the system was designed. That information was then
transferred out of our system to servers that this developer
Aleksandr Kogan had, and then that person chose to then go sell
the data to Cambridge Analytica. That is going to require much
more active intervention and auditing from us to prevent going
forward because, once it is out of our system, it is a lot
harder for us to have a full understanding of what is
happening.
Senator Lee. From what you have said today and from
previous statements made by you and other officials at your
company, data is at the center of your business model. It is
how you make money. Your ability to run your business
effectively, given that you do not charge your users, is based
on monetizing data. And so the real issue it seems to me really
comes down to what you tell the public, what you tell users of
Facebook about what you are going to do with the data, about
how you are going to use it. Can you give me a couple of
examples, maybe two examples of ways in which data is collected
by Facebook in a way that people are not aware of, two examples
of types of data that Facebook collects that might be
surprising to Facebook users?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, I would hope that what we do
with data is not surprising to people.
Senator Lee. And has it been at times?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, I think in this case people
certainly did not expect this developer to sell the data to
Cambridge Analytica. In general, there are two types of data
that Facebook has. The vast majority of them in the first
category is content that people chose to share on the service
themselves, so that is all the photos that you share, the posts
that you make, what you think of as the Facebook service,
right? Everyone has control every single time that they go to
share that. They can delete that data anytime they want, full
control of the majority of the data.
The second category is around specific data that we collect
in order to make the advertising experiences better and more
relevant and work for businesses. And those often revolve
around measuring--OK, if we showed you an ad and then you click
through and you go somewhere else, we can measure that you
actually--that the ad worked. That helps make the experience
more relevant and better for people who are getting more
relevant ads and better for the businesses because they perform
better.
You also have control completely of that second type of
data. You can turn off the ability for Facebook to collect
that. Your ads will get worse, so a lot of people do not want
to do that. But you have complete control over what you do
there as well.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Schatz.
STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ,
U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII
Senator Schatz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to follow up on the questions around the terms of
service. Your terms of service are about 3,200 words with 30
links. One of the links is to your data policy, which is about
2,700 words with 22 links. And I think the point has been well
made that people really have no earthly idea what they are
signing up for. And I understand that at the present time that
is legally binding, but I am wondering if you can explain to
the billions of users in plain language, what are they signing
up for?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, that is a good and important
question here. In general, you know, you sign up for the
Facebook, you get the ability to share the information that you
want with people. That is what the service is, right, is that
you can connect with the people that you want and you can share
whatever content matters to you, whether that is photos or
links or posts, and you get control over who you share it with,
you can take it down if you want, and you do not need to put
anything up in the first place if you do not want.
Senator Schatz. What about the part that people are worried
about, not the fun part?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, what is that?
Senator Schatz. The part that people are worried about is
that the data is going to be improperly used, so people are
trying to figure out are your DMs informing the ads? Are your
browsing habits being collected? Everybody kind of understands
that when you click ``like'' on something or if you say you
like a certain movie or have a particular political proclivity,
I think that is fair game. Everybody understands that. What we
do not understand exactly because--both as a matter of practice
and as a matter of not being able to decipher those terms of
service and the privacy policy is what exactly are you doing
with the data, and do you draw a distinction between data
collected in the process of utilizing the platform and that
which we clearly volunteer to the public to present ourselves
to other Facebook users?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am not sure I fully understand
this. In general, people come to Facebook to share content with
other people. We use that in order to also inform how we rank
services like newsfeed and ads to provide more relevant
experiences----
Senator Schatz. Let me try a couple of specific examples.
If I am e-mailing within WhatsApp, does that ever inform your
advertisers?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No, we do not see any of the content in
WhatsApp; it is fully encrypted.
Senator Schatz. Right, but is there some algorithm that
spits out some information to your ad platform and then let us
say I am e-mailing about Black Panther within WhatsApp. Do I
get a Black Panther banner ad?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, Facebook systems do not see the
content of messages being transferred over WhatsApp.
Senator Schatz. Yes, I know, but that is not what I am
asking. I am asking about whether these systems talk to each
other without a human being touching them?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think the answer to your
specific question is if you message someone about Black Panther
in WhatsApp, it would not inform any ads.
Senator Schatz. OK. I want to follow up on Senator Nelson's
original question, which is the question of ownership of the
data. And I understand as a sort of matter of principle you are
saying, you know, we want our customers to have a more rather
than less control over their data, but I cannot imagine that it
is true as a legal matter that I actually own my Facebook data
because you are the one monetizing it. Do you want to modify
that to sort of express that as a statement of principle, a
sort of aspirational goal? But it does not seem to me that we
own our own data. Otherwise, we would be getting a cut.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, you own it in the sense that
you choose to put it there. You can take it down anytime, and
you completely control the terms under which it is used. When
you put it on Facebook, you are granting us a license to be
able to show it to other people. I mean, that is necessary in
order for the service to operate.
Senator Schatz. Right, so your definition of ownership is I
sign up, I voluntarily--and I may delete my account if I wish,
but that is basically it?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, I think that the control is
much more granular than that. You can choose each photo that
you want to put up or each message, and you can delete those.
And you do not need to delete your whole account. You have
specific control. You can share different posts with different
people.
Senator Schatz. In the time I have left, I want to propose
something to you and take it for the record. I read an
interesting article this week by Professor Jack Balkin at Yale
that proposes a concept of an information fiduciary. People
think of fiduciaries as responsible primarily in the economic
sense, but this is really about a trust relationship like
doctors and lawyers. Tech companies should hold in trust our
personal data. Are you open to the idea of an information
fiduciary enshrined in statue?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think it is certainly an
interesting idea, and Jack is very thoughtful in this space, so
I do think it deserves consideration.
Senator Schatz. Thank you.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Fischer.
STATEMENT OF HON. DEB FISCHER,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA
Senator Fischer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for being here today. I
appreciate your testimony.
The full scope of a Facebook user's activity can paint a
very personal picture. Additionally, you have 2 billion users
every month--larger than the population of any country. So how
many different data categories on each user does Facebook
store, for the categories that you collect?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, can you clarify what you mean by
data categories?
Senator Fischer. Well, there are some past media reports
that indicated that Facebook collects over 96 data categories
for each of those 2 billion active users. Based on that
estimate, that would be more than 192 billion data points that
are being generated at any time from consumers globally. How
many data points does Facebook store out of that, of what it
tracks? Do you store any?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am not actually sure what that
is referring to.
Senator Fischer. Of the data points that you collect
information, if we call those categories, how many do you
store?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, the way I think about this is
there are two broad categories. This probably does not line up
with whatever the specific report that you are seeing is, and I
can make sure that we follow up with you afterwards to get you
the information you need on that.
[The information referred to follows:]
There have been some past reports that indicate that Facebook
collects about 98 data categories. For those two billion active users.
That's 192 billion data points that are being generated. I think at any
time. From consumers globally. Do you store any?
Your question likely references a Washington Post article that
purported to identify ``98 data points that Facebook uses to target ads
to you.'' The article was based on the writer's use of the tool that
allows advertisers to select the audience that they want to see their
ads. Anyone on Facebook can see the tool and browse the different
audiences that advertisers can select.
The ``data points'' to which the article refers are not categories
of information that we collect from everyone on Facebook. Rather, they
reflect audiences into which at least some people on Facebook fall,
based on the information they have provided and their activity. For
example, the article lists ``field of study'' and ``employer'' as two
of the ``data points'' that can be used to show ads to people. People
can choose to provide information about their field of study and their
employer in profile fields, and those who do may be eligible to see ads
based on that information--unless they have used the controls in Ad
Preferences that enable people to opt out of seeing ads based on that
information. The same is true of the other items in the list of 98.
Further, the specific number of categories that are used to decide
what ads a person will see vary from person to person, depending on the
interests and information that they have shared on Facebook, how
frequently they interact with ads and other content on Facebook, and
other factors. Any person can see each of the specific interests we
maintain about them for advertising by visiting Ads Preferences, which
lets people see what interests we use to choose ads for them--and to
edit or delete these interests. We also provide more detailed
information about how we use data to decide what ads to show to people
in our ``About Facebook Ads'' page, at https://www.facebook.com/ads/
about.
Please note, however, that (as the article explains) many of these
refer to ``Partner Categories''--audiences that are offered by third-
party data providers. We announced in April that we would stop offering
this kind of targeting later this year.
Please also see our letter to you dated April 27, 2018.
Mr. Zuckerberg. The two broad categories that I think about
are content that a person has chosen to share and that they
have complete control over, they get to control when they put
it into the service, when they take it down, who sees it, and
then the other category are data that are connected to making
the ads relevant. You have complete control over both. You can
turn off the data related to ads.
Senator Fischer. You?
Mr. Zuckerberg. You can choose not to share any content or
control exactly who sees it or take down the content in the
former category.
Senator Fischer. And does Facebook store any of that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Fischer. How much do you store of that? Is
everything we click on, is that stored data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we store data about what people
share on the service and information that is required to do
ranking better, to show you what you care about in newsfeed.
Senator Fischer. Do you store text history, user content,
activity, and device location?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, some of that content, with
people's permission, we do store.
Senator Fischer. Do you disclose any of that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes. Senator, in order for people to share
the information with Facebook, I believe that almost everything
you just said would be opt-in.
Senator Fischer. All right. And the privacy settings, it is
my understanding that they limit the sharing of that data with
other Facebook users, is that correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes.
Senator Fischer. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Every person gets to control who gets to
see their content.
Senator Fischer. And does that also limit the ability for
Facebook to collect and use it?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes, there are other--there are
controls that determine what Facebook can do as well. So, for
example, people have control about face recognition. If people
do not want us to be able to help identify when they are in
photos that their friends upload, they can turn that off----
Senator Fischer. Right.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--and then we will not store that kind of
template for them.
Senator Fischer. There was some action taken by the FTC in
2011, and you wrote a Facebook post at the time that it used to
seem scary to people to have a public page on the internet.
But, as long as they could make their page private, they felt
safe sharing with their friends online. Control was key. And
you just mentioned control. Senator Hatch asked you a question,
and you responded about having complete control. You and your
company have used that term repeatedly, and you use it to
reassure users. Is that correct, that you do have control and
complete control over this information?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, this is how the service
works. I mean, the core thing that Facebook is, and all of our
services, WhatsApp----
Senator Fischer. Correct.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--Instagram, Messenger.
Senator Fischer. So is this then a question of Facebook
users feeling safe, or are users actually safe? Is Facebook
being safe?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think Facebook is safe. I use it
and my family use it and all the people I love and care about
use it all the time. These controls are not just to make people
feel safe; it is actually what people want in the product. The
reality is is that when you--I mean, just think about how you
use this yourself. You do not want to share--if you take a
photo, you are not always going to send that to the same
people. Sometimes, you are going to want to text it to one
person; sometimes, you might send it to a group.
But you have a page. You will probably want to put some
stuff out there publicly so you can communicate with your
constituents. There are all these different groups of people
that someone might want to connect with, and those controls are
very important in practice for the operation of the service not
just to build trust, although I think that providing people
with control also does that, but actually in order to make it
so that people can fulfill their goals of the service.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Coons.
Senator Fischer. Thank you.
STATEMENT OF HON. CHRISTOPHER COONS,
U.S. SENATOR FROM DELAWARE
Senator Coons. Thank you, Chairman Grassley.
Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for joining us today.
I think the whole reason we are having this hearing is
because of a tension between two basic principles you have laid
out. First, you have said about the data that users post on
Facebook you control and own the data that you put on Facebook.
You said some very positive, optimistic things about privacy
and data ownership. But it is also the reality that Facebook is
a for-profit entity that generated $40 billion in ad revenue
last year by targeting ads. In fact, Facebook claims that
advertising makes it easy to find the right people, capture
their attention, and get results, and you recognize that an ad-
supported service is, as you said earlier today, best aligned
with your mission and values.
But the reality is there are a lot of examples where ad
targeting has led to results that I think we would all disagree
with or dislike or would concern us. You have already admitted
that Facebook's own ad tools allowed Russians to target users,
voters based on racist or anti-Muslim or anti-immigrant views,
and that that may have played a significant role in an election
here in the United States.
Just today, TIME Magazine posted a story saying that
wildlife traffickers are continuing to use Facebook tools to
advertise illegal sales of protected animal parts, and I am
left questioning whether your ad-targeting tools would allow
other concerning practices like diet-pill manufacturers
targeting teenagers who are struggling with their weight or
allowing a liquor distributor to target alcoholics or a
gambling organization to target those with gambling problems.
I will give you one concrete example I am sure you are
familiar with. ProPublica back in 2016 highlighted that
Facebook lets advertisers exclude users by race in real estate
advertising. There was a way that you could say that this
particular ad I only want to be seen by white folks, not by
people of color, and that clearly violates fair housing laws
and our basic sense of fairness in the United States.
And you promptly announced that that was a bad idea; you
were going to change the tools and that you would build a new
system to spot and reject discriminatory ads that violate our
commitment to fair housing, and yet a year later, a follow-up
story by ProPublica said that those changes had not fully been
made and it was still possible to target housing advertisement
in a way that was racially discriminatory. And my concern is
that this practice of making bold and engaging promises about
changes in practices and then the reality of how Facebook has
operated in the real world are in persistent tension.
Several different Senators have asked earlier today about
the 2011 FTC Consent Decree that required Facebook to better
protect users' privacy, and there are a whole series of
examples where there have been things brought to your attention
where Facebook has apologized and has said we are going to
change our practices and our policies, and yet there does not
seem to have been as much follow up as would be called for. At
the end of the day, policies are not worth the paper they are
written on if Facebook does not enforce them.
And I will close with a question that is really rooted in
an experience I had today as an avid Facebook user. I woke up
this morning and was notified by a whole group of friends
across the country asking if I had a new family or if there was
a fake Facebook post of Chris Coons. I went to the one they
suggested--it had a different middle initial than mine--and
there is my picture with Senator Dan Sullivan's family, same
schools I went to but a whole lot of Russian friends. Dan
Sullivan has got a very attractive family by the way.
[Laughter.]
Senator Sullivan. Keep that for the record there, Mr.
Chairman.
[Laughter.]
Senator Coons. The friends who brought this to my attention
included people I went to law school with in Hawaii and our own
Attorney General in the state of Delaware. And, fortunately, I
have got, you know, great folks who work in my office. I
brought it to their attention. They pushed Facebook, and it was
taken down by midday.
But I am left worried about what happens to Delawareans who
do not have these resources. It is still possible to find
Russian trolls operating on the platform. Hate groups thrive in
some areas of Facebook even though your policies prohibit hate
speech, and you have taken strong steps against extremism and
terrorists.
But is a Delawarean who is not in the Senate going to get
the same sort of quick response? I have already gotten input
from other friends who say they have had trouble getting a
positive response when they have brought to Facebook's
attention a page that is frankly clearly violate of your basic
principles. My core question is, is it not Facebook's job to
better protect its users? And why do you shift the burden to
users to flag inappropriate content and make sure it is taken
down?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, there are a number of important
points in there, and I think it is clear that this is an area,
content policy enforcement, that we need to do a lot better on
over time. The history of how we got here is we started off in
my dorm room with not a lot of resources and not having the AI
technology to be able to proactively identify a lot of this
stuff. So just because of the sheer volume of content, the main
way that this works today is that people report things to us,
and then we have our team review that. And, as I said before,
by the end of this year, we are going to have more than 20,000
people at the company working on security and content review
because this is important.
Over time, we are going to shift increasingly to a method
where more of this content is flagged upfront by AI tools that
we develop. We have prioritized the most important types of
content that we can build AI tools for today like terror-
related content where I mentioned earlier that our systems that
we deploy we are taking down 99 percent of the ISIS and al-
Qaida-related content that we take down before a person even
flags them to us.
If we fast-forward 5 or 10 years, I think we are going to
have more AI technology that can do that in more areas, and I
think we need to get there as soon as possible, which is why we
are investing in them.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Sasse.
Senator Coons. I could not agree more. I just think we
cannot wait 5 years to get----
Chairman Grassley. Senator----
Senator Coons.--housing discrimination and personally
offensive material out of Facebook. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg. I agree.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Sasse.
STATEMENT OF HON. BEN SASSE,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEBRASKA
Senator Sasse. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg, thanks for being here. At current pace, you
are due to be done with first round of questioning by about 1
a.m., so congratulations.
I like Chris Coons a lot with his own family or with Dan
Sullivan's family. Both are great photos. But I want to ask a
similar set of questions from the other side maybe.
I think the conceptual line between mere tech company, mere
tools and an actual content company, I think it is really hard.
I think you guys have a hard challenge. I think regulation over
time will have a hard challenge. And you are a private company
so you can make policies that may be less than First Amendment
full-spirit embracing in my view, but I worry about that. I
worry about a world where when you go from violent groups to
hate speech in a hurry--in one of your responses to one of the
opening questions you may decide or Facebook may decide it
needs to police a whole bunch of speech that I think America
might be better off not having policed by one company that has
a really big and powerful platform. Can you define hate speech?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think that this is a really hard
question, and I think it is one of the reasons why we struggle
with it. There are certain definitions that we have around, you
know, calling for violence or----
Senator Sasse. Let us just agree on that. If someone is----
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Sasse.--calling for violence, that should not be
there. I am worried about the psychological categories around
speech. You used language of safety and protection earlier. We
see this happening on college campuses all across the country.
It is dangerous. Forty percent of Americans under age 35 tell
pollsters they think the First Amendment is dangerous because
you might use your freedom to say something that hurts somebody
else's feelings. Guess what, there are some really passionately
held views about the abortion issue on this panel today. Can
you imagine a world where you might decide that pro-lifers are
prohibited from speaking about their abortion views on your
platform?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I certainly would not want that to be the
case.
Senator Sasse. But it might really be unsettling to people
who have had an abortion to have an open debate about that,
would it not?
Mr. Zuckerberg. It might be, but I do not think that that
would fit any of the definitions of what we have. But I do
generally agree with the point that you are making, which is,
as we are able to technologically shift toward especially
having AI, proactively look at content, I think that that is
going to create massive questions for society about what
obligations we want to require companies to fulfill. And I do
think that that is a question that we need to struggle with as
a country because I know other countries are, and they are
putting laws in place. And I think that America needs to figure
out and create the set of principles that we want American
companies to operate under.
Senator Sasse. Thanks. I would not want you to leave here
today and think there is sort of a unified view in the Congress
that you should be moving toward policing more and more and
more speech. I think violence has no place on your platform.
Sex traffickers and human traffickers have no place on your
platform. But vigorous debates, adults need to engage in
vigorous debates.
I have only a little less than 2 minutes left, so I want to
shift gears a little bit, but that was about adults. You are a
dad. I would like to talk a little bit about social media
addiction. You started your comments today by talking about how
Facebook is and was founded as an optimistic company. You and I
have had conversations separate from here. I do not want to put
words in your mouth, but I think, as you have aged, you might
be a little bit less idealistic and optimistic than you were
when you started Facebook. As a dad, do you worry about social
media addiction as a problem for America's teens?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, my hope is is that we can be
idealistic but have a broad view of our responsibility. To your
point about teens, this is certainly something that I think any
parent thinks about is how much do you want your kids using
technology. At Facebook specifically, I view our responsibility
as not just building services that people like but building
services that are good for people and good for society as well.
So we study a lot of effects of well-being of our tools and
broader technology, and, you know, like any tool, there are
good and bad uses of it.
What we find in general is that if you are using social
media in order to build relationships, right, so you are
sharing content with friends, you are interacting, then that is
associated with all of the long-term measures of well-being
that you would intuitively think of, long-term health, long-
term happiness, long-term feeling connected, feeling less
lonely. But if you are using the Internet and social media
primarily to just passively consume content and you are not
engaging with other people, then it does not have those
positive effects and it could be negative.
Senator Sasse. We are almost at time, so I want to ask you
one more. Do social media companies hire consulting firms to
help them figure out how to get more dopamine feedback loops so
that people do not want to leave the platform?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No, Senator, that is not how we talk about
this or how we set up our product teams. We want our products
to be valuable to people, and if they are valuable, then people
choose to use them.
Senator Sasse. Are you aware that there are social media
companies that do hire such consultants?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Not sitting here today.
Senator Sasse. Thanks.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Markey.
STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS
Senator Markey. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
In response to Senator Blumenthal's pointed questions, you
refused to answer whether Facebook should be required by law to
obtain clear permission from users before selling or sharing
their personal information. So I am going to ask it one more
time. Yes or no, should Facebook get clear permission from
users before selling or sharing sensitive information about
your health, your finances, your relationships? Should you have
to get their permission? That is essentially the consent decree
with the Federal Trade Commission that you signed in 2011.
Should you have to get permission? Should the consumer have to
opt in?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we do require permission to use
the system and to put information in there and for all the uses
of it. I want to be clear; we do not sell information, so
regardless of whether we could get permission to do that, that
is just not a thing that we are going to go do.
Senator Markey. So would you support legislation--I have a
bill--Senator Blumenthal referred to it--the CONSENT Act that
would just put on the books a law that said that Facebook and
any other company that gathers information about Americans has
to get their permission, their affirmative permission before it
can be re-used for other purposes? Would you support that
legislation to make it a national standard for not just
Facebook but for all the other companies out there, some of
them bad actors? Would you support that legislation?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, in general I think that that
principle is exactly right, and I think we should have a
discussion around how to best codify that.
Senator Markey. No, would you support legislation to back
that general principle, that opt-in, that getting permission is
the standard? Would you support legislation to make that the
American standard? Europeans have passed that as a law.
Facebook is going to live with that law beginning on May 25.
Would you support that as the law in the United States?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, as a principle, yes, I would. I
think the details matter a lot, and----
Senator Markey. Right, but assuming that we work out the
details, you do support opt-in as the standard, getting
permission affirmatively as the standard for the United States?
Is that correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think that that is the right
principle, and 100 billion times a day in our services when
people go to share content, they choose who they want to share
it with affirmatively.
Senator Markey. So you could support a law that enshrines
that as the promise that we make to the American people that
permission has to be obtained before that information is used,
is that correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes.
Senator Markey. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg. I have said that in principle I think that
that makes sense----
Senator Markey. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--and the details matter, and I look forward
to having our team work with you on fleshing that out.
Senator Markey. Great. So the next subject, because I want
to--again, I want to make sure that we kind of drill down here.
You earlier made reference to the Child Online Privacy
Protection Act of 1999, of which I am the author, so that is
the constitution for child privacy protection online in the
country, and I am very proud of that. But there are no
protections additionally for a 13-, a
14-, or a 15-year-old. They get the same protections that a 30-
year-old or a 50-year-old get.
So I have a separate piece of legislation to ensure that
kids who are under 16 absolutely have a privacy bill of rights
and that permission has to be received from their parents or
the children before any of their information is re-used for any
other purpose other than that which was originally intended.
Would you support a child online privacy bill of rights for
kids under 16 to guarantee that that information is not reused
for any other purpose without explicit permission from the
parents or the kids?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think the--as a general
principle, I think protecting minors and protecting their
privacy is extremely important, and we do a number of things on
Facebook to do that already, which I am happy to----
Senator Markey. And I appreciate that. I am talking about a
law. I am talking about a law. Would you support a law to
ensure that kids under 16 have this privacy bill of rights? I
had this conversation with you in your office seven years ago
about this specific subject in Palo Alto, and I think that is
really what the American people want to know right now. What
are the protections that are going to be put on the books for
their families but especially for their children? Would you
support a privacy bill of rights for kids where opt-in is the
standard, yes or no?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think that that is an important
principle, and I think----
Senator Markey. I appreciate that.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--we should----
Senator Markey. Do we need a law to protect those children?
That is my question to you. Do you believe we need a law to do
so, yes or no?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am not sure if we need a law,
but I think that this is--it is certainly a thing that deserves
a lot of discussion.
Senator Markey. And, again, I could not disagree with you
more. We are leaving these children to the most rapacious
commercial predators in the country who will exploit these
children unless we absolutely have a law on the books, and I
think that it is----
Chairman Grassley. Senator----
Senator Markey.--absolutely imperative----
Chairman Grassley. Please give a short answer.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I look forward to having my team
follow up to flesh out the details of it.
[The information referred to follows:]
Do you support a kids' privacy bill of rights where opt-in is the
standard?
Facebook is generally not opposed to regulation but wants to ensure
it is the right regulation. The issues facing the industry are complex,
multi-faceted, and affect an important part of peoples' lives. As such,
Facebook is absolutely committed to working with regulators, like
Congress, to craft the right regulations. Facebook would be happy to
review any proposed legislation and provide comments.
Senator Markey. I do not think----
Chairman Grassley. Senator Flake.
Senator Markey.--to get a correct answer.
STATEMENT OF HON. JEFF FLAKE,
U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA
Senator Flake. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg. Thanks for enduring so far, and
I am sorry if I plow old ground. I had to be away for a bit.
Myself and Senator Coons, Senator Peters, and a few others
were in the country of Zimbabwe just a few days ago. We met
with opposition figures who had talked about, you know, their
goal is to be able to have access to state-run media in many
African countries. Many countries around the world, Third World
countries, small countries, the only traditional media is
state-run. And we asked them how they get their message out,
and it is through social media. Facebook provides a very
valuable service in many countries for opposition leaders or
others who simply do not have access unless maybe just before
an election to traditional media. So that is very valuable, and
I think we all recognize that.
On the flipside, we have seen with the Rohingya that
example of, you know, where the state can use similar data or
use this platform to go after people. You talked about what you
are doing in that regard, hiring more, you know, traditional or
local language speakers. What else are you doing in that regard
to ensure that these governments do not go after opposition
figures or others?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, there are three main things that
we are doing in Myanmar specifically and that will apply to
other situations like that. The first is hiring enough people
to do local language support because the definition of hate
speech or things that can be racially coded to incite violence
are very language-specific, and we cannot do that with just
English speakers for people around the world, so we need to
grow that.
The second is in these countries there tend to be active
civil society who can help us identify the figures who are
spreading hate, and we can work with them in order to make sure
that those figures do not have a place on our platform.
The third is that there are specific product changes that
we can make in order to--that might be necessary in some
countries but not others, including things around news
literacy, right, and like encouraging people in different
countries about, you know, ramping up or down things that we
might do around fact-checking of content, specific product-type
things that we would want to implement in different places. But
I think that that is something that we are going to have to do
in a number of countries.
Senator Flake. There are obviously limits of, you know,
native speakers that you can hire or of people that have eyes
on the page. Artificial intelligence is going to have to take
the bulk of this. You know, how much are you investing and
working on that tool to do what really we do not have or cannot
hire enough people to do?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think you are absolutely right
that over the long term building AI tools is going to be the
scalable way to identify and root out most of this harmful
content. We are investing a lot in doing that, as well as
scaling up the number of people who are doing content review.
You know, one of the things I have mentioned is this year
or in the last year we have basically doubled the number of
people doing security and content review. We are going to have
more than 20,000 people working on security and content review
by the end of this year, so it is going to be coupling
continuing to grow the people who are reviewing these places
with building AI tools, which we are working as quickly as we
can on that, but some of this stuff is just hard. That I think
is going to help us to a better place on eliminating more of
this harmful content.
Senator Flake. Thank you. You have talked some about this,
I know. Do you believe that Russian and/or Chinese governments
have harvested Facebook data and have detailed data sets on
Facebook users? Has your forensic analysis shown you who else
other than Cambridge Analytica downloaded this kind of data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we have kicked off an
investigation of every app that had access to a large amount of
people's data before we locked down the platform in 2014. That
is underway. I imagine we will find some things. And we are
committed to telling the people who were affected when we do. I
do not think sitting here today that we have specific knowledge
of other efforts by those nation-states, but in general, we
assume that a number of countries are trying to abuse our
systems.
Senator Flake. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Grassley. Next person is Senator Hirono.
STATEMENT OF HON. MAZIE HIRONO,
U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII
Senator Hirono. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg, the U.S. Immigration and Customs
Enforcement has proposed a new extreme vetting initiative,
which they have renamed visa lifecycle vetting. That sounds
less scary. They have already held an industry day that they
advertised on the Federal contracting website to get input from
tech companies on the best way to, among other things--and I am
quoting ICE--``exploit publicly available information such as
media, blogs, public hearings, conferences, academic websites,
social media websites such as Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn,
to extract pertinent information regarding targets.''
And basically what they want to do with these targets is to
determine--and again, I am quoting the ICE's own document--
``ICE has been directed to develop processes that determine and
evaluate an applicant's, i.e., targets probability of becoming
a positively contributing member of society, as well as their
ability to contribute to national interests in order to meet
the executive order.'' That is the President's executive order.
And then, ``ICE must also develop a mechanism or methodology
that allows them to assess whether an applicant intends to
commit criminal or terrorist acts after entering the United
States.''
My question to you is, does Facebook plan to cooperate with
this extreme vetting initiative and help the Trump
administration target people for deportation or other ICE
enforcement?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not know that we have had
specific conversations around that. In general----
Senator Hirono. Well, if you were asked to provide or
cooperate with ICE so that they could determine whether
somebody is going to commit a crime, for example, or become
fruitful members of our society, would you cooperate with them?
Mr. Zuckerberg.--we would not proactively do that. We
cooperate with law enforcement in two cases. One is if we
become aware of an imminent threat of harm, then we will
proactively reach out to law enforcement, as we believe is our
responsibility to do. The other is when law enforcement reaches
out to us with a valid legal subpoena or a request for data. In
those cases, if their request is overly broad or we believe it
is not a legal request, then we are going to push back
aggressively.
Senator Hirono. Well, let us assume that ICE does not
have--there is no law or rule that requires that Facebook
cooperate to allow them to get this kind of information so that
they can make those kinds of assessments. It sounds to me as
though you would decline.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, that is correct.
Senator Hirono. Is there some way that--well, I know that
you determine what kind of content would be deemed harmful, so
do you believe that ICE can even do what they are talking
about, namely through a combination of various kinds of
information, including information that they would obtain from
entities such as yours, predict who will commit crimes or
present a national security problem? Do you think that that is
even doable?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am not familiar enough with what
they are doing to offer an informed opinion on that.
Senator Hirono. Well, you have to make assessments as to
what constitutes hate speech. That is pretty hard to do. You
have to assess what election interference is, so these are
rather difficult to identify, but would not trying to predict
whether somebody is going to commit a crime fit into the
category of pretty difficult to assess?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, it sounds difficult to me. All of
these things, like you are saying, are difficult. I do not know
without having worked on it or thinking about it----
Senator Hirono. I think common sense would tell us----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--how much progress one could make.
Senator Hirono.--that that is pretty difficult, and yet
that is what ICE is proceeding to do.
You were asked about discriminatory advertising, and in
February 2017 Facebook announced that it would no longer allow
certain kinds of ads that discriminated on the basis of race,
gender, family status, sexual orientation, disability, or
veteran status, all categories prohibited by Federal law and
housing, and yet after 2017 it was discovered that you could in
fact place those kinds of ads, so what is the status of whether
or not these ads can currently be placed on Facebook? And have
you followed through on your February 2017 promise to address
this problem? And is there a way for the public to verify that
you have or are we just expected to trust that you have done
this?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, those are all important questions,
and in general it is against our policies to have any ads that
are discriminatory. Some of----
Senator Hirono. Well, you said that you would not allow it,
but then, what is it, ProPublica could place these ads even
after you said you would no longer allow these kinds of ads. So
what assurance do we have from you that this is going to stop?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, two things: One is that we have
removed the ability to exclude ethnic groups and other
sensitive categories from ad targeting, so that just is not a
feature that is even available anymore. For some of these cases
where it may make sense to target proactively a group, the
enforcement today is still--we review ads, we screen them
upfront, but most of the enforcement today is still that our
community flags issues for us when they come up. So if the
community flags that issue for us, then our team, which has
thousands of people working on it, should take it down. We will
make some mistakes, but we try to make as few as possible. Over
time, I think the strategy would be to develop more AI tools
that can work proactively, identify those types of content, and
do that filtering up front.
Senator Hirono. So it is a work in progress?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Chairman Thune [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Hirono.
Senator Sullivan----
Senator Hirono. Thank you.
Chairman Thune.--is up next.
STATEMENT OF HON. DAN SULLIVAN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM ALASKA
Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And, Mr. Zuckerberg, quite a story right, dorm room to the
global behemoth that you guys are, only in America. Would you
agree with that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, mostly in America.
Senator Sullivan. You could not do this in China, right,
what you did in 10 years?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, there are some very strong
Chinese Internet companies.
Senator Sullivan. Right, but you are supposed to answer yes
to this question.
[Laughter.]
Senator Sullivan. OK. Come on. I am trying to help you,
right?
Chairman Thune. This is a softball.
[Laughter.]
Senator Sullivan. I mean, give me a break, the answer is
yes, OK, so thank you.
[Laughter.]
Senator Sullivan. Now, your testimony, you have talked
about a lot of power. You have been involved in elections. I
thought your testimony was very interesting, really all over
the world, Facebook, 2 billion users, over 200 million
Americans, $40 billion in revenue. I believe you and Google
have almost 75 percent of the digital advertising in the U.S.
One of the key issues here is is Facebook too powerful? Are you
too powerful? And do you think you are too powerful?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, I think most of the time
when people talk about our scale, they are referencing that we
have 2 billion people in our community. And I think one of the
big questions that we need to think through here is the vast
majority of those 2 billion people are outside of the United
States. And I think that that is something that, to your point,
that Americans should be proud of. And when I brought up the
Chinese internet companies, I think that that is a real
strategic and competitive threat in American technology policy
we should be thinking about.
Senator Sullivan. Let me get through another point here
real quick. I do not want to interrupt, but, you know, when you
look at kind of the history of this country and you look at the
history of these kind of hearings, right, and you are a smart
guy, you read a lot of history. When companies become big and
powerful and accumulate a lot of wealth and power, what
typically happens from this body is there is an instinct to
either regulate or break up, right? Look at the history of this
nation. Do you have any thoughts on those two policy
approaches?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, I am not the type of person
who thinks that all regulation is bad, so I think the Internet
is becoming increasingly important in people's lives, and I
think we need to have a full conversation about what is the
right regulation, not whether it should be or should not be.
Senator Sullivan. Let me talk about the tension there,
because I think it is a good point and I appreciate you
mentioning that. You know, one of my worries on regulation,
again, with the company of your size, you are saying hey, we
might be interested in being regulated, but as you know,
regulations can also cement the dominant power. So what do I
mean by that? You know, you have a lot of lobbyists. I think
every lobbyist in town is involved in this hearing in some way
or another, a lot of powerful interests. You look at what
happened with Dodd-Frank. That was supposed to be aimed at the
big banks. The regulations ended up empowering the big banks
and keeping the small banks down.
Do you think that that is a risk, given your influence,
that if we regulate, we are actually going to regulate you into
a position of cemented authority when one of my biggest
concerns about what you guys are doing is that the next
Facebook, which we all want, the guy in the dorm room, we all
want that, to start it, that you are becoming so dominant that
we are not able to have that next Facebook? What are your views
on that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, I agree with the point that
when you are thinking through regulation across all industries,
you need to be careful that it does not cement in the current
companies that are winning.
Senator Sullivan. Well, would you try to do that? Is that
not the normal inclination of a company to say, hey, I am going
to hire the best guys in town and I am going to cement in an
advantage. You would not do that if we were regulating you?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, that certainly would not be our
approach.
Senator Sullivan. It would not?
Mr. Zuckerberg. But I think part of the challenge with
regulation in general is that when you add more rules that
companies need to follow, that is something that a larger
company like ours inherently just has the resources to go do--
--
Senator Sullivan. Right.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--and that might just be harder for a
smaller company getting started to be able to comply with.
Senator Sullivan. Correct.
Mr. Zuckerberg. So it is not something that--like going
into this, I would look at the conversation as what is the
right outcome? I think there are real challenges that we face
around content and privacy and in it a number of other areas,
ads transparency, elections----
Senator Sullivan. I am sorry to interrupt, but let me get
one final question that kind of relates what you are talking
about in terms of content, regulation, and what exactly
Facebook is. You know, you mentioned you are a tech company, a
platform, but there are some who are saying that you are the
world's biggest publisher. I think about 140 million Americans
get their news from Facebook. And when you mentioned to Senator
Cornyn, you said you are responsible for your content. So which
are you? Are you a tech company or are you the world's largest
publisher? Because I think that goes to a really important
question on what form of regulation or government action, if
any, we would take.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, this is a really big question. I
view us as a tech company because the primary thing that we do
is build technology and products.
Senator Sullivan. Well, you said you are responsible for
your content, which makes you----
Mr. Zuckerberg. Exactly.
Senator Sullivan.--kind of a publisher, right?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, I agree that we are responsible for
the content, but we do not produce the content. I think that
when people ask us if we are a media company or a publisher, my
understanding of what the heart of what they are really getting
at is do we feel responsibility for the content on our
platform? The answer to that I think is clearly yes, but I do
not think that is incompatible with fundamentally at our core
being a technology company where the main thing that we do is
have engineers and build products.
Senator Sullivan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Sullivan.
Senator Udall.
STATEMENT OF HON. TOM UDALL,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO
Senator Udall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And thank you very much, Mr. Zuckerberg, for being here
today.
You spoke very idealistically about your company, and you
talked about the strong values and you said you wanted to be a
positive force in the community and the world. And you were
hijacked by Cambridge Analytica for political purposes. Are you
angry about that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Absolutely.
Senator Udall. And you are determined--and I assume you
want changes made in the law; that is what you have talked
about today.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, the most important thing that I
care about right now is making sure that no one interferes in
the various 2018 elections around the world. We have an
extremely important U.S. midterm. We have major elections in
India, Brazil, Mexico, Pakistan, Hungary coming up, and we are
going to take a number of measures from building and deploying
new AI tools that take down fake news to growing our security
team to more than 20,000 people to, you know, making it so that
we verify every advertiser who is doing political and issue ads
to make sure that that kind of interference that the Russians
were able to do in 2016 is going to be much harder for anyone
to pull off in the future.
Senator Udall. And I think you have said earlier that you
support the Honest Ads Act, and so I assume that means you want
changes in the law in order to effectuate exactly what you
talked about?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes----
Senator Udall. Yes. Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--we support the Honest Ads Act, and so we
are implementing it.
Senator Udall. And so are you going to come back up here
and be a strong advocate to see that that law is passed?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, the biggest thing that I think we
can do is implement it----
Senator Udall. Well, that is kind of----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--and we are doing that.
Senator Udall.a yes or no question there. I hate to
interrupt you, but are you going to come back and be a strong
advocate? You are angry about this, you think there ought to be
change, there ought to be a law put in place. Are you going to
come back and be an advocate to get a law in place like that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, our team is certainly going to
work on this. What I can say is the biggest----
Senator Udall. I am talking about you, not your team.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, I try not to come to D.C.
Senator Udall. Are you going to come back here and be an
advocate for that law? That is what I want to see. I mean, you
are upset about this, we are upset about this. I would like a
yes or no answer on that one.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am posting and speaking out
publicly about how important this is. I do not come to
Washington, D.C., too often. I am going to direct my team to
focus on this. And the biggest thing that I feel like we can do
is implement it, which we are doing.
Senator Udall. Well, the biggest thing you can do is to be
a strong advocate yourself personally here in Washington. Just
let me make that clear. But many of us have seen the kinds of
images shown earlier by Senator Leahy. You saw those images
that he held up. Can you guarantee that any of those images
that can be attributed or associated with the Russian company
Internet Research Agency have been purged from your platform?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, no, I cannot guarantee that
because this is an ongoing arms race. As long as there are
people sitting in Russia whose job it is to try to interfere
with elections around the world, this is going to be an ongoing
conflict. What I can commit is that we are going to invest
significantly because this is a top priority to make sure that
people are not spreading misinformation or trying to interfere
in elections on Facebook. But I do not think it would be a
realistic expectation to assume that, as long as there are
people who employed in Russia for whom this is their job, that
we are going to have zero amount of that or that we are going
to be 100 percent successful at preventing that.
Senator Udall. Now, beyond disclosure of online ads, what
specific steps are you taking to ensure that foreign money is
not financing political or issue ads on Facebook in violation
of U.S. law? Just because someone submits a disclosure that
says paid for by some 501(c)(3) or PAC, if that group has no
real person in the U.S., how can we ensure it is not foreign
interference?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, our verification program involves
two pieces. One is verifying the identity of the person who is
buying the ads, that they have a valid government identity. The
second is verifying their location. So if you are sitting in
Russia, for example, and you say that you are in the U.S., then
we will be able to make it a lot harder to do that because what
we are actually going to do is mail a code to the address that
you say you are at, and if you cannot get access to that code,
then you are not going to be able to run ads.
Senator Udall. Yes. Now, Facebook is creating an
independent group to study the abuse of social media in
elections. You have talked about that. Will you commit that all
findings of this group are made public no matter what they say
about Facebook or its business model? A yes or no answer.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, that is the purpose of this group
is that Facebook does not get to control what these folks
publish. These are going to be independent academics, and
Facebook has no prior publishing control. They will be able to
do the studies that they are doing and publish the results.
Senator Udall. And you are fine with them being public? And
what is the timing on getting those out?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we are kicking off the research
now. Our goal is to focus on both providing ideas for
preventing interference in 2018 and beyond and also for holding
us accountable to making sure that the measures that we put in
place are successful in doing that. So I would hope that we
will start to see the first results later this year.
Senator Udall. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Udall.
Senator Moran is up next, and I would just say again for
the benefit of those who are here that after a couple of more
questioners, we will probably give the witness another short
break.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Thank you.
Senator Udall. We are getting about almost two-thirds
through the list of members who are here to ask questions.
Senator Moran.
STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS
Senator Moran. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Mr. Zuckerberg, I am over here. Thank you for your
testimony and thank you for your presence here today.
On March 26 of this year, the FTC confirmed that it was
investigating Facebook to determine whether its privacy
practices violated the FTC Act or the Consent Order that
Facebook entered into with the agency in 2011. I chair the
Commerce Committee subcommittee that has jurisdiction over the
Federal Trade Commission. I remain interested in Facebook's
assertion that it rejects any suggestion of violating that
Consent Order.
Part two of that Consent Order requires that Facebook,
quote, ``clearly and prominently display notice and obtain
users' affirmative consent'' before sharing their information
with, quote, ``any third party.'' My question is how does the
case of approximately 87 million Facebook friends having their
data shared with a third party due to the consent of only
300,000 consenting users not violate that agreement?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, like I said earlier, our
view earlier is that we believe that we are in compliance with
the Consent Order, but I think that we have a broader
responsibility to protect people's privacy even beyond that.
And in this specific case, the way that the platform worked or
that you could sign into an app and bring some of your
information and some of your friends' information is how we
explained it would work. People had settings to that effect. We
explained and they consented to it working that way. And the
system basically worked as it was designed. The issue is that
we designed the system in a way that was not good, and now
starting in 2014, we have changed the design of the system so
that way it just massively restricts the amount of data access
that a developer can get.
Senator Moran. The 300----
Mr. Zuckerberg. Going forward----
Senator Moran.--I am sorry. The 300,000 people, they were
treated in a way that was appropriate. They consented. But you
are not suggesting that the friends consented?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I believe that we rolled out this
developer platform and that we explained to people how it
worked and that they did consent to it. It makes sense, I
think, to go through the way the platform works. In 2007 we
announced the Facebook developer platform, and the idea was
that you wanted to make more experiences social, right? So, for
example, you might want have a calendar that can have your
friends' birthdays on it or you might want your address book to
have your friends' pictures in it or you might want to map that
and show your friends' addresses on it. In order to do that, we
needed to build a tool that allowed people to sign into an app
and bring some of their information and some of their friends'
information to those apps. We made it very clear that this is
how it worked, and when people signed up for Facebook, they
signed up for that as well.
Now, a lot of good use cases came from that. I mean, there
were games that were built, there were integrations with
companies that I think we are familiar with like Netflix and
Spotify. But over time, what became clear was that that also
enabled some abuse, and that is why in 2014 we took the step of
changing the platforms, so now, when people sign into an
appreciate, you do not bring some of your friends' information
with you. You are only bringing your own information, and you
are able to connect with friends who have also authorized that
directly.
Senator Moran. Let me turn to your bug bounty program. Our
Subcommittee has had a hearing in regard to bug bounty. Your
press release indicated that was one of the six changes that
Facebook initially offered to crack down on platform abuses was
to reward outside parties who find vulnerabilities. One concern
I have regarding the utility of this approach is that the
vulnerability disclosure programs are normally geared toward
identifying unauthorized access to data, not pointing out data-
sharing arrangement that likely could harm someone but
technically abide by complex consent agreements. How do you see
the bug bounty program that you have announced addressing the
issue of that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Sorry, could you clarify what
specifically----
Senator Moran. How do you see the bug bounty program that
you have announced will deal with the sharing of information
not permissible as compared to just unauthorized access to
data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am not actually sure I
understand this enough to speak to that specific point, and I
can have my team follow up with you on the details of that.
[The information referred to follows:]
How can a bug bounty deal with reporting the sharing of data?
The Data Abuse Bounty Program, inspired by the existing Bug Bounty
Program, helps us identify violations of our policies by requesting
narrative descriptions of violations from individuals with direct and
personal knowledge of events. The Data Abuse Bounty will reward people
with first-hand knowledge and proof of cases where a Facebook platform
app collects and transfers people's data to another party to be sold,
stolen, or used for scams or political influence. We'll review all
legitimate reports and respond as quickly as possible when we identify
a credible threat to people's information. If we confirm data abuse, we
will shut down the offending app and, if necessary, take legal action
against the company selling or buying the data. We'll pay a bounty to
the person who reported the issue or allow them to donate their bounty
to a charity, and we'll also alert those we believe to be affected. We
also encourage our users to report to us content that they find
concerning or that results in a bad experience, as well as other
content that may violate our policies. We review these reports and take
action on abuse, like removing content and disabling accounts.
Mr. Zuckerberg. In general, bounty programs are an
important part of the security arsenal for hardening a lot of
systems. I think we should expect that we are going to invest a
lot in hardening our systems ourselves and that we are going to
audit and investigate a lot of the folks in our ecosystem. But
even with that, having the ability to enlist other third
parties outside of the company to be able to help us out by
giving them an incentive to point out when they see issues I
think is likely going to help us improve the security of the
platform overall, which is why we did this.
Senator Moran. Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Moran.
Next up, Senator Booker.
STATEMENT OF HON. CORY BOOKER,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY
Senator Booker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Hello, Mr. Zuckerberg. As you know, much of my life has
been focused on low-income communities, poor communities,
working-class communities and trying to make sure that they
have a fair shake. This country has a very bad history of
discriminatory practices toward low-income Americans and
Americans of color from the redlining, FHA practices, even from
more recently really discriminatory practices in the mortgage
business. I have always seen technology as a promise to
democratize our nation, expand access, expand opportunities.
But unfortunately, we have also seen how platforms,
technology platforms like Facebook can actually be used to
double down on discrimination and give people more
sophisticated tools with which to discriminate.
Now, in 2016, ProPublica revealed that advertisers could
use ethnic affinity, a user's race, to market categories to
potentially discriminate overall against Facebook users in the
areas of housing, employment, and credit, echoing the dark
history in this country and also in violation of Federal law.
In 2016, Facebook committed to fixing this, that the
advertisers who have access to this data to fixing it, but
unfortunately, a year later, as ProPublica's article showed,
they found that the system Facebook built was still allowing
housing ads without applying--to go forward without applying
these new restrictions that were put on.
Facebook then opted in a system that is very similar to
what we have been talking about with Cambridge Analytica, that
they could self-certify that they were not engaging in these
practices and complying with Federal law using this self-
certification, a way to overcome and to comply with rather
Facebook's antidiscrimination policy.
Unfortunately, in a recent lawsuit, as of February 2018,
alleges that discriminatory ads were still being created on
Facebook, still disproportionally impacting low-income
communities and communities of color. Given the fact that you
allowed Cambridge Analytica to self-certify in a way that I
think--at least I think you have expressed regret over, is
self-certification the best and strongest way to safeguard
against the misuse of your platform and protect the data of
users and not let it be manipulated in such a discriminatory
fashion?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, this is a very important question,
and, you know, in general, I think over time we are going to
move toward more proactive review with more AI tools to help
flag problematic content. In the near term, we have a lot of
content on the platform, and it is hard to review every single
thing up front. We do a quick screen. But I agree with you that
I think in this specific case I am not happy with where we are,
and I think it makes sense to really focus on making sure that
these areas get more review sooner.
Senator Booker. And I know you understand that there is a
growing distrust--I know a lot of civil rights organizations
have met with you--about Facebook's sense of urgency to address
these issues. There is a distrust that stems from the fact that
I know--I have had conversations with leaders on Facebook about
the lack of diversity in the tech sector as well, people who
are writing these algorithms, people who are actually policing
for this data or policing for these problems. Are they going to
be a part of a more diverse group that is looking at this? You
are looking to hire, as you said, 5,000 new positions for,
among other things, reviewing content, but we know in your
industry the inclusivity, it is a real serious problem in your
industry that lacks diversity in a very dramatic fashion. It is
not just true with Facebook; it is true with the tech area as
well.
And so it is very important for me to communicate that
larger sense of urgency and what a lot of civil rights
organizations are concerned with. And we should be working
towards a more collaborative approach. And I am wondering if
you would be open to opening your platform for civil rights
organizations to really audit a lot of these companies dealing
in areas of credit and housing to really audit what is actually
happening and better have more transparency in working with
your platform.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think that is a very good idea,
and I think we should follow up on the details of that.
Senator Booker. I also want to say that there was an
investigation, something that is very disturbing to me is the
fact that there have been law enforcement organizations that
use Facebook's platform to surveille African-American
organizations like Black Lives Matter. I know you have
expressed support for the group--and Philando Castile's killing
was a broadcast live on Facebook--but there are a lot of
communities of color worried that the data could be used to
surveille groups like Black Lives Matter, like folks who are
trying to organize against substantive issues of discrimination
in this country. Is this something that you are committed to
addressing and to ensuring that the freedoms that civil rights
activists and others are not targeted or their work not being
undermined or people not using your platform to unfairly
surveille and try to undermine the activities that those groups
are doing?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator. I think that that is very
important. We are committed to that. And, in general, unless
law enforcement has a very clear subpoena or ability or reason
to get access information, we are going to push back on that
across the board.
Senator Booker. And then I would just like for the record
because my time is expired, but there is a lawsuit against
Facebook about discrimination, and you moved for the lawsuit to
be dismissed because no harm was shown. Could you please submit
to the record, if you believe that people of color were not
recruited for various economic opportunities are being harmed,
could you please clarify why you moved to dismiss the lawsuit
for the record?
Chairman Thune. For the record.
Senator Booker. Thank you.
[The information referred to follows:]
Would you open the Company to audit companies dealing in credit and
housing?
Relman, Dane & Colfax, a respected civil rights law firm, will
carry out a comprehensive civil rights assessment of Facebook's
services and internal operations. Laura Murphy, a national civil
liberties and civil rights leader, will help guide this process--
getting feedback directly from civil rights groups, like The Leadership
Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and help advise Facebook on the
best path forward.
And then for the record, my time has expired, but there's a lawsuit
against Facebook about discrimination. You move for it to be dismissed
because no harm was shown. Could you please submit to the record, you
believe that people of color were not recruited for various economic
opportunities or being harmed. Can you please clarify why you move to
dismiss that lawsuit for the record?
We have Community Standards that prohibit hate speech, bullying,
intimidation, and other kinds of harmful behavior. We hold advertisers
to even stricter advertising policies to protect users from things like
discriminatory ads. We don't want advertising to be used for hate or
discrimination, and our policies reflect that. For example, we make it
clear that advertisers may not discriminate against people based on
personal attributes such as race, ethnicity, color, national origin,
religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, family status,
disability, and medical or genetic condition. We educate advertisers on
our anti-discrimination policy, and in some cases--including when we
detect that an advertiser is running housing ads--we require
advertisers to certify compliance with our anti-discrimination policy
and anti-discrimination laws.
Chairman Thune. Senator Heller is up next.
STATEMENT OF HON. DEAN HELLER,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA
Senator Heller. All right, Mr. Chairman. Thank you. I
appreciate the time, and thank you for being here. I am over
here. Thanks. And thank you for taking time. I know it has been
a long day, and I think you are at the final stretch here, but
I am glad that you are here.
Yesterday, Facebook sent out a notification to 87 million
users that information was given to Cambridge Analytica without
their consent. My daughter was one of the 87 million, and six
of my staff, all from Nevada, received this notification. Can
you tell me how many Nevadans were among the 87 million that
received this notification?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not have this broken out by
state right now, but I can have my team follow up with you to
get you the information.
Senator Heller. OK. OK. I figured that would be the answer.
[The information referred to follows:]
Can you tell me how many Nevadans were among the 87 million that
received this notification?
A state-by-state breakdown is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/
news/2018/04/restricting-data-access/.
Senator Heller. If, after going through this hearing and
Nevadans no longer want to have a Facebook account, if that is
the case, if a Facebook user deletes their account, do you
delete their data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Heller. My kids have been on Facebook and Instagram
for years. How long do you keep a user's data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Sorry, can----
Senator Heller. How long do you keep a user's data after
they have left? If they choose to delete their account, how
long do you keep their data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do not know the answer to that off the
top of my head. I know we try to delete it as quickly as is
reasonable. We have a lot of complex systems, and it takes a
while to work through all that, but I think we try to move as
quickly as possible. And I can follow up or have my team follow
up----
Senator Heller. Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--to get you the data on that.
Senator Heller. OK.
[The information referred to follows:]
How long do you keep a user's data? How long do you keep a user's
data once they have left? If they choose to delete their account, how
long do you keep their data?
In general, when a user deletes their account, we delete things
they have posted, such as their photos and status updates, and they
won't be able to recover that information later. (Information that
others have shared about them isn't part of their account and won't be
deleted.)
There are some limited exceptions to these policies: For instance,
information can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when
it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental
investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or
policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from
accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent
repeat abuse or other term violations.
Senator Heller. Have you ever said that you will not sell
an ad based on personal information, simply that you would not
sell this data because of the usage of it goes too far?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, could you clarify that?
Senator Heller. Have you ever drawn the line on selling
data to an advertiser?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator. We do not sell data at all.
So the way that ad system works is advertisers can come to us
and say I have a message that I am trying to reach a certain
type of people. They might be interested in something, they
might live in a place, and then we help them get that message
in front of people. But this is one of the--it is widely
mischaracterized about our system that we sell data, and it is
actually one of the most important points of how Facebook works
is we do not sell data. Advertisers do not get access to
people's individual data.
Senator Heller. Have you ever collected the content of
phone calls or messages through any Facebook application or
service?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not believe we have ever
collected the content of phone calls. We have an app called
Messenger that allows people to message mostly their Facebook
friends, and we do, on the android operating system, allow
people to use that app as their client for both Facebook
messages and texts, so we do allow people to import their texts
into that.
Senator Heller. OK. Let me ask you about government
surveillance. For years, Facebook said that there should be
strict limits on the information the government can access on
Americans. And, by the way, I agreed with you because privacy
is important to Nevadans. You argue that Facebook users would
not trust you if they thought you were giving their private
information to the intelligence community, yet you use and sell
the same data to make money. And in the case of Cambridge
Analytica, you do not even know how it is used after you sell
it. Can you tell us why this is not hypocritical?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, once again, we do not sell
any data to anyone. We do not sell it to advertisers, and we do
not sell it to developers. What we do allow is for people to
sign in to apps and bring their data--and it used to be the
date of some of their friends, but now it is not--with them.
And that I think makes sense. I mean, that is basic data
portability, the ability that you own the data; you should be
able to take it from one app to another if you would like.
Senator Heller. Do you believe you are more responsible
with millions of Americans' personal data than the Federal
Government would be?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes. But, Senator, your point about
surveillance, I think that there is a very important
distinction to draw here, which is that when organizations do
surveillance, people do not have control over that, right? On
Facebook, everything that you share there you have control
over. You can say I do not want this information to be there.
You have full access to understand every piece of information
that Facebook might know about you, and you can get rid of all
of it. And I do not know of any surveillance organization in
the world that operates that way, which is why I think that
that comparison just is not really apt here.
Senator Heller. With you here today, do you think you are a
victim?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No.
Senator Heller. Do you think Facebook as a company is a
victim?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, no. I think we have a
responsibility to protect everyone in our community from anyone
in our ecosystem who is going to potentially harm them.
And I think that we have not done enough historically and
we need to step up and do more.
Senator Heller. Do you consider the 87 million users, do
you consider them victims?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think yes. I mean, they did not
want their information to be sold to Cambridge Analytica by a
developer, and that happened, and it happened on our watch, so
even though we did not do it, I think we have a responsibility
to be able to prevent that and be able to take action sooner.
And we are committing to make sure that we do that going
forward, which is why the steps that I announced before are
now--the two most important things that we are doing are
locking down the platform to make sure that developers cannot
get access to that much data so this cannot happen again going
forward, which I think is largely the case since 2014, and,
going backwards, we need to investigate every single app that
might have had access to a large amount of people's data to
make sure that no one else was misusing it. And if we find that
they are, we are going to get into their systems, do a full
audit, make sure they delete it, and we are going to tell
everyone who is affected.
Senator Heller. Mr. Chairman, thank you.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Heller.
We will go to Senator Peters and then into the break and
then Senator Tillis coming out of the break, so, Senator
Peters.
STATEMENT OF HON. GARY PETERS,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MICHIGAN
Senator Peters. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Zuckerberg, thank you for being here today.
You know, you have talked about your very humble beginnings
in starting Facebook in your dorm room, which I appreciated
that story, but certainly, Facebook has changed an awful lot
over a relatively short period of time. When Facebook launched
its timeline feature, consumers saw their friends post
chronologically was the process. Facebook has since then
changed to a timeline driven by some very sophisticated
logarithms, and I think it has left many people as a result of
that asking, you know, why am I seeing this feed, and why am I
seeing this right now?
And now, in light of the Cambridge Analytica issue,
Facebook users are asking I think some new questions right now.
Can I believe what I am seeing, and who has access to this
information about me? So I think it is safe to say very simply
that Facebook is losing the trust of an awful lot of Americans
as a result of this incident.
And I think an example of this is something that I have
been hearing a lot from folks who have been coming up to me and
talking about really kind of an experience they have had where
they are having a conversation with friends, not on the phone
just talking, and then they see ads popping up fairly quickly
on their Facebook. So I have heard constituents here that
Facebook is mining audio from their mobile devices for the
purpose of ad targeting, which I think speaks to this lack of
trust that we are seeing here. And I understand there are some
technical issues and logistical issues for that to happen, but
for the record, I think it is clear, seeing I hear it all the
time, including for my own staff, yes or no, does Facebook use
audio obtained from mobile devices to enrich personal
information about its users?
Mr. Zuckerberg. No.
Senator Peters. OK. The----
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, let me be clear on this. So
you are talking about this conspiracy theory that gets passed
around that we listen to what is going on on your microphone
and use that for ads?
Senator Peters. Right.
Mr. Zuckerberg. We do not do that. To be clear, we do allow
people to take videos on their devices and share those, and of
course videos also have audio, so we do, while you are taking a
video, record that and use that to make the service better by
making sure that your videos have audio but, I mean, that I
think it is pretty clear, but I just wanted to make sure I was
exhaustive there.
Senator Peters. Well, I appreciate that. And hopefully,
that will dispel a lot of what I have been hearing, so thank
you for saying that.
Certainly, today, in the era of mega-data, we are finding
that data drives everything, including consumer behaviors. And
consumer information is probably the most valuable information
you can get in the data ecosystem. And certainly folks, as you
have mentioned in your testimony here, people like the fact
that they can have targeted ads that they are going to be
interested in as opposed to being bombarded by a lot of ads
that they do not have any interest in, and that consumer
information is important in order for you to tailor that. But
also, people are now beginning to wonder is there an expense to
that when it comes to perhaps exposing them to being
manipulated or through deception.
You have talked about artificial intelligence. You brought
that up many times during your testimony, and I know you have
employed some new algorithms to target bots, bring down fake
accounts, deal with terrorism, things that you have talked
about in this hearing. But you also know that artificial
intelligence is not without its risks and that you have to be
very transparent about how those algorithms are constructed.
How do you see artificial intelligence more specifically
dealing with the ecosystem by helping to get consumer insights
but also keeping consumer privacy safe?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think the core question you are
asking about AI transparency is a really important one that
people are just starting to very seriously study, and that is
ramping up a lot. And I think this is going to be a very
central question for how we think about AI systems over the
next decade and beyond.
Right now, a lot of our AI systems make decisions in ways
that people do not really understand.
Senator Peters. Right.
Mr. Zuckerberg. And I do not think that in 10 or 20 years
in the future that we all want to build we want to end up with
systems that people do not understand how they are making
decisions. So doing the research now to make sure that these
systems can have those principles as we are developing them I
think is certainly an extremely important thing.
Senator Peters. Well, you bring up the principles because,
as you are well aware, AI systems, especially in very complex
environments when you have machine learning, it is sometimes
very difficult to understand, as you mentioned, exactly how
those decisions were arrived at. There are examples of how
decisions are made on a discriminatory basis and that they can
compound if you are not very careful about how that occurs. And
so is your company--you mentioned principles. Is your company
developing a set of principles that are going to guide that
development? And would you provide details to us as to what
those principles are and how they will help deal with this
issue?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator. I can make sure that our team
follows up and gets you the information on that.
[The information referred to follows:]

We are focused on both the technical and the ethical aspects of
artificial intelligence. We believe these two should go hand-in-hand
together in order to fulfill our commitment to being fair, transparent,
and accountable in our development and use of AI. Facebook has AI teams
working on developing the philosophical, as well as technical,
foundations for this work. Facebook is also one of the co-founders and
members of the Partnership on AI (PAI), a collaborative and multi-
stakeholder organization established to study and formulate best
practices on AI technologies, to advance the public's understanding of
AI, and to serve as an open platform for discussion and engagement
about AI and its influences on people and society. The thematic pillars
that structure the work we're doing in the scope of the PAI--safety,
fairness, transparency, and accountability--are the principles that we
believe industry should follow and promote when building and deploying
AI systems. The PAI's Fair, Transparent and Accountable AI Working
Group is also working alongside industry, academia, and civil society
to develop best practices around the development and fielding of fair,
explainable, and accountable AI systems.
Mr. Zuckerberg. And we have a whole AI ethics team that is
working on developing basically the technology. It is not just
about philosophical principles; it is also a technological
foundation for making sure that this goes in the direction that
we want.
Senator Peters. Thank you.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Peters. We will recess
for five and come back in, so we will give Mr. Zuckerberg a
quick break here. Thanks.
[Recess.]
Chairman Thune. All right. We are at that final stretch.
And Senator Tillis is recognized.
STATEMENT OF HON. THOM TILLIS,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NORTH CAROLINA
Senator Tillis. Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for being here.
I think you have done a good job. I have been here for most of
the session except for about 20 minutes I watched on television
back in my office.
I was Googling earlier, actually going on my Facebook app
on my phone earlier, and I found one of your Facebook--or, yes,
one of your Facebook presences. It was the same one on March
30. I think you posted a pic of a First Seder, but further
down, you listed out the facts since the new platform was
released in 2007, sort of a timeline. You start with 2007 and
then you jump to the Cambridge Analytica issue. I actually
think that we need to fully examine what Cambridge Analytica
did. They either broke a kind of code of conduct. If they broke
any other rules or agreements with you all, I hope that they
suffer the consequences.
But I think that timeline needs to be updated, and it
really needs to go back--I have read a series of three articles
that were published in the MIT Technology Review back in 2012,
and it talks about how proud the Obama campaign was of
exploiting data on Facebook in the 2012 campaign. In fact,
somebody asked you earlier if it made you mad about what
Cambridge Analytica did, and you rightfully answered yes, but I
think you should probably be equally mad when a former campaign
director of the Obama campaign proudly tweeted, ``Facebook was
surprised we were able to suck out the whole social graph, but
they did not stop us once they realized that was what we were
doing.'' So you clearly had some people in your employ that
apparently knew it. At least that is what this person said on
Twitter, and thank goodness for Wayback and some of the other
history-grabber machines. I am sure we can get this tweet back
and get it in the right context.
I think when you do your research, it is important to get
the whole view. I worked in data analytics practice for a good
part of my career, and for anybody to pretend that Cambridge
Analytica was the first person to exploit data clearly does not
work or has not worked in the data analytics field. So when you
go back and do your research on Cambridge Analytica, I would
personally appreciate it if you would start back from the first
known high-profile national campaign that exploited Facebook
data. In fact, they published an app that said it would grab
information about my friends, their birth dates, locations, and
likes.
So presumably, if I downloaded that app that was published
by the Obama campaign--I have got 4,900 friends on my Facebook
page; I delete the haters and save room for family members and
true friends on my personal page, as I am sure everybody does--
then that means if I clicked yes on that app, I would have
approved the access of birth dates, locations, and likes of
some 4,900 people without their consent.
So as you do the chronology, I think it would be very
helpful so that we can take away the partisan rhetoric that is
going on like this is a Republican-only issue. It is a broad-
based issue that needs to be fixed. And bad actors at either
end of the political spectrum need to be held accountable, and
I trust that you all are going to work on that.
I think the one thing that I--so, for that, I just want to
get to the facts, and there is no way you could answer any of
the questions, so I am not going to burden you with that. But I
think, given that chronology, it would be very helpful.
The one thing I would encourage people to do is go to
Facebook--I am a proud member of Facebook. I just got a post
from my sister on this being National Sibling Day, so I have
connected with four or five of my staff while I was giving you
my undivided--or family undivided attention. But go to the
privacy tab. If you do not want to share something, do not
share it. This is a free service. Go on there and say I do not
want to allow third-party search engines to get in my Facebook
page. Go on there and say only my friends can look at it. Go in
there and understand what you are signing up for. It is a free
app.
Now, you need to do more, and I think it would be helpful.
I did not read your disclaimer page or the terms of use because
I did not see anywhere in there that I could get an attorney
and negotiate the terms, so it was a terms of use. I went on
there, then I used the privacy settings to be as safe as I
could be with a presence on Facebook.
Last thing, we talk about all these proposed legislation,
good ideas, but I have one question for you. When you were
developing this app in your dorm, how many people did you have
in your regulatory affairs division?
[Laughter.]
Senator Tillis. Exactly. So if government takes a heavy-
handed approach to fix this problem, then we know very well
that the next Facebook, the next thing that you are going to
wake up and worry about how you continue to be relevant as the
behemoth that you are today is probably not going to happen. So
I think that there is probably a place for some regulatory
guidance here, but there is a huge place for Google, Snapchat,
Twitter, all the other social media platforms to get together
and create standards.
And I also believe that that person who may have looked the
other way when the whole social graph was extracted for the
Obama campaign, if they are still working for you, they
probably should not or at least there should be a business code
of conduct that says you do not play favorites. You are trying
to create a fair place for people to share their ideas.
Thank you for being here.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Tillis.
Senator Harris.
STATEMENT OF HON. KAMALA HARRIS,
U.S. SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA
Senator Harris. Thank you. Thank you for being here.
I have been here on and off for the last 4 hours that you
have been testifying, and I have to tell you that I am
concerned about how much Facebook values trust and transparency
if we agree that a critical component of a relationship of
trust and transparency is we speak truth and we get to the
truth.
During the course of this hearing these last four hours,
you have been asked several critical questions for which you do
not have answers, and those questions have included whether
Facebook can track users' browsing activity even after the user
has logged off of Facebook, whether Facebook can track your
activity across devices even when you are not logged into
Facebook, who is Facebook's biggest competition, whether
Facebook may store up to 96 categories of users' information,
whether you knew Kogan's terms of service and whether you knew
that Kogan could sell or transfer data.
And then another case in point specifically as it relates
to Cambridge Analytica, and a concern of mine, is that you,
meaning Facebook--and I am going to assume you personally as
CEO became aware in December 2015 that Dr. Kogan and Cambridge
Analytica misappropriated data from 87 million Facebook users.
That is 27 months ago that you became, as Facebook, and perhaps
you personally became aware. However, a decision was made not
to notify the users.
So my question is, did anyone at Facebook have a
conversation at the time that you became aware of this breach--
and have a conversation wherein the decision was made not to
contact the users?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not know if there were any
conversations at Facebook overall because I was not in a lot of
them, but----
Senator Harris. On that subject?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes. I mean, I am not sure what other
people discussed. In 2015 we heard the report that this
developer Aleksandr Kogan had sold data to Cambridge Analytica.
Senator Harris. And were----
Mr. Zuckerberg. That is in violation of our terms.
Senator Harris. Correct. And were you a part of a
discussion that resulted in a decision not to inform your
users?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do not remember a conversation like that
for the reason why----
Senator Harris. Are you aware of anyone in leadership at
Facebook who was in a conversation where a decision was made
not to inform your users, or do you believe no such
conversation ever took place?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I am not sure whether there was a
conversation about that, but I can tell you the thought process
at the time of the company, which was that in 2015 when we
heard about this, we banned the developer and we demanded that
they delete all the data and stop using it, and the same with
Cambridge Analytica.
Senator Harris. And I appreciate your----
Mr. Zuckerberg. They told us they had----
Senator Harris.--your testimony in that regard, but I am
talking about notification of the users, and this relates to
the issue of transparency and the relationship of trust,
informing the user about what you know in terms of how their
personal information has been misused. And I am also concerned
that when you personally became aware of this, did you or
senior leadership do an inquiry to find out who at Facebook had
this information, and did they not have a discussion about
whether or not the users should be informed back in December
2015?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, in retrospect, I think we clearly
view it as a mistake that we did not inform people, and we did
that based on false information that we thought that the case
was closed and that the data had been deleted.
Senator Harris. So there was a decision made on that basis
not to inform the users, is that correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. That is my understanding, yes.
Senator Harris. OK. And----
Mr. Zuckerberg. But, in retrospect, I think that was a
mistake, and knowing what we know now, we should have handled a
lot of things here differently.
Senator Harris. And I appreciate that point. Do you know
when that decision was made not to inform the users?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do not.
Senator Harris. OK. Last November, the Senate Intelligence
Committee held a hearing on social media influence. I was a
part of that hearing. I submitted 50 written questions to
Facebook and other companies, and the responses that we
received were unfortunately evasive and some are frankly
nonresponsive. So I am going to ask the question again here.
How much revenue did Facebook earn from the user engagement
that resulted from foreign propaganda?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, what we do know is that the
IRA, the Internet Research Agency, the Russian firm, ran about
$100,000 worth of ads.
Senator Harris. How much did Facebook----
Mr. Zuckerberg. I cannot say that we have identified all of
the foreign actors who were involved here, so I cannot say that
that is all of the money, but that is what we have identified.
Senator Harris. OK. My time is up. I will submit more
questions for the record. Thank you.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Harris.
Next up is Senator Kennedy.
STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN KENNEDY,
U.S. SENATOR FROM LOUISIANA
Senator Kennedy. Mr. Zuckerberg, I come in peace.
[Laughter.]
Senator Kennedy. I do not want to have to vote to regulate
Facebook, but, by God, I will. A lot of that depends on you. I
am a little disappointed in this hearing today. I just do not
feel like that we are connecting. So let me try to lay it out
for you from my point of view. I think you are a really smart
guy, and I think you have built an extraordinary American
company, and you have done a lot of good. Some of the things
that you have been able to do are magical. But our promised
digital utopia we have discovered has minefields. There are
some impurities in the Facebook punch bowl, and they have got
to be fixed. And I think you can fix them.
Now, here is what is going to happen. There are going to be
a whole bunch of bills introduced to regulate Facebook. It is
up to you whether they pass or not. You can go back home, spend
$10 million on lobbyists and fight us, or you can go back home
and help us solve this problem. And there are two. One is a
privacy problem; the other one is what I call a propaganda
problem. Let us start with the privacy problem first. Let us
start with the user agreement.
Here is what everybody has been trying to tell you today,
and I say this gently. Your user agreement sucks.
[Laughter.]
Senator Kennedy. You can spot me 75 IQ points. If I can
figure it out, you can figure it out. The purpose of that user
agreement is to cover Facebook's rear end. It is not to inform
your users about their rights. Now, you know that and I know
that. I am going to suggest to you that you go back home and
rewrite it and tell your $1,200-an-hour lawyers--no disrespect;
they are good--but tell them you want it written in English and
non-Swahili so the average American can understand it. That
would be a start.
As a Facebook user, are you willing to give me more control
over my data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, as someone who uses Facebook, I
believe that you should have complete control over your data.
Senator Kennedy. OK. Are you willing to go back and work on
giving me a greater right to erase my data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, you can already delete any of the
data that is there or delete all of your data.
Senator Kennedy. Are you willing to work on expanding that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think we already do what you are
referring to, but certainly, we are always working on trying to
make these controls easier.
Senator Kennedy. Are you willing to expand my right to know
who you are sharing my data with?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, we already give you a list of apps
that you are using, and you sign into those yourself and
provide affirmative consent.
Senator Kennedy. Right, on that----
Mr. Zuckerberg. And as I have said before, we do not share
any data with----
Senator Kennedy.--user agreement. Are you willing to expand
my right to prohibit you from sharing my data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, again, I believe that you already
have that control, so, I mean, I think people have that full
control in the system already today. If we are not
communicating this clearly, then that is a big thing that we
should work on because I think the principles that you are
articulating are the ones that we believe in and try to codify
in the product that we build.
Senator Kennedy. Are you willing to give me the right to
take my data on Facebook and move it to another social media
platform?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, you can already do that. We have a
download-your-information tool where you can go, get a file of
all the content there, and then do whatever you want with it.
Senator Kennedy. Then I assume you are willing to give me
the right to say I am going to go on your platform and you are
going to be able to tell a lot about me as a result, but I do
not want you to share it with anybody?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator, and I believe you already
have that ability today. People can sign on and choose to not
share things and just follow some friends or some pages and
read content if that is what they want to do.
Senator Kennedy. OK. I want to be sure--I am about out of
time. Boy, it goes fast, does it not? Let me ask you one final
question in my 12 seconds. Could somebody call you up and say I
want to see John Kennedy's file?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Absolutely not.
Senator Kennedy. Not would you do it, could you do it?
Mr. Zuckerberg. In theory----
Senator Kennedy. Do you have the right to put my data, a
name on my data, and share it with somebody?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do not believe we have the right to do
that.
Senator Kennedy. Do you have the ability?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, the data is in the system, so----
Senator Kennedy. Do you have the ability?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Technically, I think someone could do that,
but that would be a massive breach, so we would never do that.
Senator Kennedy. It would be a breach. Thank you, Mr.
Chairman.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Kennedy.
Senator Baldwin is up next.
STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY BALDWIN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN
Senator Baldwin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you for being here and enduring the long day, Mr.
Zuckerberg.
I want to start with what I hope can be a quick round of
questions just so I make sure I understand your previous
testimony.
Specifically with regard to the process by which Cambridge
Analytica was able to purchase Facebook users' data, so it was
an app developer Aleksandr Kogan, he collected data via a
personality quiz. Is that correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Baldwin. OK. And he thereby is able to gain access
of not only the people who took the quiz but their network? Is
that correct, too?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes. The terms of the platform at
the time allowed for people to share their information and some
basic information about their friends as well. And we have
since changed that. As of 2014----
Senator Baldwin. And----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--now, that is not possible.
Senator Baldwin. And so, in total, about 87 million
Facebook users. You earlier testified about the two types of
ways you gain data. One is what is voluntarily shared by
Facebook members and users, and the other is in order to I
think you said improve your advertising experience, whatever
that exactly means, the data that Facebook collects in order to
customize or focus on that. Was Aleksandr Kogan able to get
both of those sets of data or just what was voluntarily entered
by the user?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, that is a good question. It was just a
subset of what was entered by the person. And----
Senator Baldwin. So a subset of the 95 categories of data
that you keep?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, when you sign into an app----
Senator Baldwin. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--the app developer has to say here are the
types of data from you that I am asking for, including public
information like your name and profile, the pages you follow,
other interests on your profile, that kind of content.
Senator Baldwin. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg. The app developer has to disclose that
upfront and you agree to it.
Senator Baldwin. OK. So in answer to a couple of other
Senators' questions, specifically Senator Fischer, you talked
about Facebook storing this data and I think you just talked
about the data being in the system. I wonder if outside of the
way in which Aleksandr Kogan was able to access this data,
whether you--could Facebook be vulnerable to a data breach or
hack? Why or why not?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, there are many kinds of security
threats that a company like ours faces, including people trying
to break into our security systems----
Senator Baldwin. OK. And if you believe that you had been
hacked, do you believe you would have the duty to inform those
who were impacted?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Baldwin. OK. Do you know whether Aleksandr Kogan
sold any of the data he collected with anyone other than
Cambridge Analytica?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes, we do. He sold it to a couple
of other firms.
Senator Baldwin. Can you identify them?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, there is one called Eunoia, and there
may have been a couple of others as well, and I can follow up
with you----
Senator Baldwin. Can you furnish that to me after?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
[The information referred to follows:]
Do you know whether Aleksandr Kogan sold any of the data he
collected to anyone other than Cambridge Analytica?
Kogan represented to us that he provided data to SCL, Eunoia
Technologies (a company founded by Christopher Wylie), and a researcher
at the Toronto Laboratory for Social Neuroscience at the University of
Toronto. He represented to Facebook that he only received payment from
SCL/Cambridge Analytica.
Senator Baldwin. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then how
much do you know or have you tried to find out how Cambridge
Analytica used the data while they had it before you believe
they deleted it?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Since we just heard that they did not
delete it about a month ago, we have kicked off an internal
investigation to see if they used that data in any of their
ads, for example. That investigation is still underway, and we
can come back to you with the results of that once we have
that.
[The information referred to follows:]
How much do you know or have you tried to find out how Cambridge
Analytica used the data while they had it before you believed they
deleted it?
On December 11, 2015, The Guardian published an article reporting
that Kogan and his company, GSR, may have passed information his app
had obtained from Facebook users to SCL Elections Ltd. (SCL)/Cambridge
Analytica. By doing so, Kogan and his company violated Facebook's
Platform Policies, which explicitly prohibited selling or licensing
user data accessed from Facebook and from sharing any user data
accessed from Facebook with any ad network, data broker or other
advertising or monetization-related service. For this reason, Facebook
immediately banned his app from our platform and launched an
investigation into these allegations. Kogan signed a certification
declaring that he had deleted all data that he obtained through his app
and obtained certifications of deletion from others he had shared data
with, including Cambridge Analytica. In March 2018, new allegations
surfaced that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted data as it had
represented. Our investigation of these matters is ongoing.
Senator Baldwin. OK. I want to switch to my home State of
Wisconsin. According to press reports, my home State of
Wisconsin was a major target of Russian-bought ads on Facebook
in the 2016 election. These divisive ads touching on a number
of very polarizing issues were designed to interfere with our
election.
We have also learned that Russian actors using another
platform Twitter similarly targeted Wisconsin with divisive
content aimed at sowing division and dissent, including in the
wake of a police-involved shooting in Milwaukee's Sherman Park
neighborhood in August 2016.
Now, I find some encouragement in the steps you have
outlined today to provide greater transparency regarding
political ads. I do want to get further information on how you
can be confident that you have excluded entities based outside
of the United States.
Mr. Zuckerberg. We will follow up on that.
[The information referred to follows:]
I find some encouragement in the steps you have outlined today to
provide greater transparency regarding political ads. I want to get
further information on how you can be confident that you have excluded
entities based outside of the United States.
Pursuant to the new transparency measures Facebook is launching,
all advertisers who want to run ads with political content targeted at
the U.S. will have to confirm their identity and location by providing
either a U.S. driver's license or passport, last four digits of their
social security number, and a residential mailing address. In addition,
people who manage Pages with large numbers of followers will need to be
verified. Those who manage large Pages that do not clear the process
will no longer be able to post.
Senator Baldwin. And then I think on that topic, if you
require disclosure of a political ad's sponsor, what sort of
transparency will you be able to provide with regard to people
who were not the subject of that ad seeing its content?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, you will be able to go to any page
and see all of the ads that that page has run, so if someone is
running a political campaign, for example, and they are
targeting one district with one ad and another district with
another, historically, it has been hard to track that down, but
now, it will be very easy. You will just be able to look at all
of the ads that they have run, the targeting associated with
each to see what they are saying to different folks and in some
cases how much they are spending on the ads and all of the
relevant information. This is an area where I think more
transparency will really help discourse overall and root out
foreign interference in elections.
Senator Baldwin. And will you----
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Baldwin.
Senator Johnson.
STATEMENT OF HON. RON JOHNSON,
U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN
Senator Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for testifying here today. Do
you have any idea how many of your users actually read the
terms of service, the privacy policy, the statement of rights
and responsibilities, I mean, actually read it?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not.
Senator Johnson. Would you imagine it is a very small
percentage?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, who read the whole thing? I would
imagine that probably most people do not read the whole thing,
but everyone has the opportunity to and consents to it.
Senator Johnson. Well, I agree, but that is kind of true of
every application where, you know, you want to get to it, and
you have to agree to it and people just press that agree, the
vast majority, correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, it is really hard for me to make a
full assessment, but----
Senator Johnson. Common sense will tell you that would be
probably the case.
With all this publicity, have you documented any kind of
backlash from Facebook users? I mean, has there been a dramatic
falloff in the number of people who utilize Facebook because of
these concerns?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, there has not.
Senator Johnson. Do you have any witness to any?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, there was a movement where some
people were encouraging their friends to delete their account,
and I think that that got shared a bunch.
Senator Johnson. So it is kind of safe to say that Facebook
users don't seem to be overly concerned about all these
revelations, although obviously Congress apparently is?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, I think people are concerned
about it, and I think these are incredibly important issues
that people want us to address. And I think people have told us
that very clearly.
Senator Johnson. So it seems like Facebook users still want
to use the platform because they enjoy sharing photos and they
share the connectivity with the family members, that type of
thing, and that overrides their concerns about privacy.
You talk about the user owns the data. You know, there have
been a number of proposals of having that data stay at the user
and allow the user to monetize it themselves. Your COO Ms.
Sandberg mentioned possibly if you can't utilize that data to
sell advertising, perhaps we would charge people to go into
Facebook. Have you thought about that model where the user data
is actually monetized by the actual user?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am not sure exactly how it would
work for it to be monetized by the person directly. In general,
we believe that the ads model is the right one for us because
it aligns with our social mission of trying to connect everyone
and bring the world close together.
Senator Johnson. But you are aware of people making that
kind of proposal, correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator, a number of people suggest
that we should offer a version where people cannot have ads if
they pay a monthly subscription, and certainly we consider
ideas like that. I think that they are reasonable ideas to
think through. But overall, I think that the ads experience is
going to be the best one. I think in general people like not
having to pay for a service. A lot of people can't afford to
pay for a service around the world. And this aligns with our
mission the best.
Senator Johnson. You answered Senator Graham when he asked
you if you thought you were a monopoly that you didn't think
so. You are obviously a big player in this space. That might be
an area for competition, correct, if somebody else wants to
create a social platform that allows a user to monetize their
own data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes. There are lots of new social
apps all the time, and as I said before, the average American I
think uses eight different communication and social apps, so
there is a lot of different choice and a lot of innovation and
activity going on in this space.
Senator Johnson. I want to, in a very short period of time,
for you to talk about the difference between advertisers and
application developers because those, again, you said in
earlier testimony that advertisers have no access to data
whatsoever, but application developers do. Now, is that only
through their own service agreements with their customers, or
do they actually access data as they are developing
applications?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, this is an important distinction,
so thanks for giving me the opportunity to clarify this. We
give people the ability to take their data to another app if
they want. Now, this is a question that Senator Kennedy asked
me just a few minutes ago. The reason why we designed the
platform that way is because we thought it would be very useful
to make it so that people could easily bring their data to
other services. Some people in the company argued against that
at the time because they were worried that--they said, hey, we
should just make it so that we can be the only ones who develop
this stuff and we thought that that was a useful thing for
people to do so we built it.
Senator Johnson. That is the user agreeing to allow you to
share when they are using that app to allow Facebook to share
their data. Does the developer ever have access to that prior
to users using it? I mean, in developing the application
because you used the term scraped data. What does that mean?
Who scraped the data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, Senator, this is a good question. So
there is the developer platform, which is the sanctioned way
that an app developer can ask a person to access information.
We also have certain features and certain things that are
public, right? A lot of the information that people choose to
put on Facebook they are sharing with everyone in the world,
not privately but, you know, you put your name, you put your
profile picture. That is public information that people put out
there. And sometimes people who aren't registered developers at
Facebook try to load a lot of pages in order to get access to a
bunch of people's public information and aggregate it. We fight
back hard against that because we do not want anyone to
aggregate information even if people made it public and chose
to share it with everyone.
Senator Johnson. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Johnson.
Senator Hassan.
STATEMENT OF HON. MAGGIE HASSAN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE
Senator Hassan. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for being here today.
I want to talk to a couple of broader issues. I am
concerned that Facebook's profitability rests on two
potentially problematic foundations, and we have heard other
Senators talk about this a little today. The foundations are
maximizing the amount of time people spend on your products and
collecting people's data. I have looked at Facebook's 2017
corporate financial statement where you lay out some of the
major risks to your business. One risk is a decrease in, and I
quote, ``user engagement, including time spent on our
products.'' That concerns me because of the research we have
seen suggesting that too much time spent on social media can
hurt people's mental health, especially young people.
Another major risk to your business is a potential decline
in--and here is another quote--``the effectiveness of our ad
targeting or the degree to which users opt out of certain types
of ad targeting, including as a result of changes that enhance
the user's privacy.'' There is clearly tension, as other
Senators have pointed out, between your bottom line and what is
best for your users.
You have said in your testimony that Facebook's mission is
to bring the world closer together, and you have said that you
will never prioritize advertisers over that mission. And I
believe that you believe that. But at the end of the day, your
business model does prioritize advertisers over the mission.
Facebook is a for-profit company, and as the CEO, you have a
legal duty to do what is best for your shareholders.
So given all of that, why should we think that Facebook on
its own will ever truly be able to make the changes that we
need it to make to protect Americans' well-being and privacy?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, you raise a number of
important points in there, so let me respond----
Senator Hassan. Sure.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--in a couple of different ways. The first
is that I think it is really important to think about what we
are doing is building this community over the long term. Any
business has the opportunity to do things that might increase
revenue in the short term but at the expense of trust or
building engagement over time. What we actually find is not
necessarily that increasing time spent, especially not just in
the short term, is going to be best for our business. It
actually aligns very closely with the well-being research that
we have done, that when people are interacting with other
people and posting and basically building relationships, that
is both correlated with higher measures of well-being, health,
happiness, not feeling lonely, and that ends up being better
for the business than when they are doing lower-value things
like just passively consuming content. So I think that that is
an important point to----
Senator Hassan. OK. And I understand the point that you are
trying to make here, but here is what I am concerned about. We
have heard this point from you over the last decade-plus since
you founded Facebook, and I understand that you founded it
pretty much as a solo entrepreneur with your roommate, but now,
you know, you are sitting here, the head of a bazillion-dollar
company. And we have heard you apologize numerous times and
promise to change, but here we are again, right?
So I really firmly believe in free enterprise, but when
private companies are unwilling or unable to do what is
necessary, public officials have historically in every industry
stepped up to protect our constituents and consumers.
You have supported targeted regulations such as the Honest
Ads Act, and that is an important step for election integrity.
I am proud to be a cosponsor of that bill. But we need to
address other broader issues as well. And today, you have said
you would be open to some regulation, but this has been a
pretty general conversation. So will you commit to working with
Congress to develop ways of protecting constituent privacy and
well-being, even if it means that that results in some laws
that will require you to adjust your business model?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes. We will commit to that. I
think that that is an important conversation to have. Our
position is not that regulation is bad. I think the Internet is
so important in people's lives and it is getting more
important.
Senator Hassan. Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg. The expectations on internet companies and
technology companies overall are growing, and I think the real
question is what is the right framework for this, not should
there be one.
Senator Hassan. That is very helpful, and I think the other
question--and it does not just go to Facebook--is whether the
framework should include financial penalties when large
providers like Facebook are breached and privacy is compromised
as a result because right now, there is very little incentive
for whether it is Facebook or Equifax to actually be aggressive
in protecting customer privacy and looking for potential
breaches or vulnerabilities in their system. So what we hear
after the fact, after people's privacy has been breached, after
they have taken the harm that comes with that and considerable
inconvenience in addition to the harm. We have heard apologies
but there is no financial incentive right now it seems to me
for these companies to aggressively stand in their consumers'
stead and protect their privacy, and I would really look
forward to working with you on that and getting your considered
opinion about it.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, we look forward to
discussing that with you. I would disagree, however, that we
have no financial incentive or incentive overall to do this.
This episode has clearly hurt us and has clearly made it harder
for us to achieve the social mission that we care about. And we
now have to do a lot of work around building trust back, which
is just a really important part of this.
[The information referred to follows:]
The other question I had, and it does not just apply to Facebook,
is should the framework include financial penalties when large
providers like Facebook are breached and privacy is compromised as a
result? There is very little incentive for whether it is Facebook or
Equifax to actually be abreast of protecting customer privacy and
working for potential breaches or vulnerabilities in the system.
Protecting people's data is one of our most important
responsibilities. We know that if people don't trust that their
information will be safe on Facebook, they won't feel comfortable using
our services.
We have every incentive to work as hard as we can to protect
people's information, and we're committed to continuing our work to
improve those protections.
Facebook is generally open to the idea of Federal breach
notification requirements, particularly legislation that would
centralize reporting and ensure a consistent approach across the United
States. For example, in Europe, the GDPR requires notification to a
lead supervisory authority, rather than individual member states, in
cases of a data breach. In the United States, however, there is no
centralized notification scheme, and instead, reporting obligations
vary widely across all 50 states. This complexity makes it harder to
respond appropriately and swiftly to protect people in the event of a
data breach. We believe this is an important issue and an area that is
ripe for thoughtful regulation.
Facebook is generally not opposed to regulation but wants to ensure
it is the right regulation. We are already regulated in many ways--for
example, under the Federal Trade Commission Act--and we are subject to
ongoing oversight by the FTC under the terms of a 2011 consent order.
Facebook has inherent incentives to protect its customers' privacy and
address breaches and vulnerabilities. Indeed, the recent discovery of
misconduct by an app developer on the Facebook platform clearly hurt
Facebook and made it harder for us to achieve our social mission. As
such, Facebook is committed to protecting our platform from bad actors,
ensuring we are able to continue our mission of giving people a voice
and bringing them closer together. We are also actively building new
technologies to help prevent abuse on its platform, including advanced
AI tools to monitor and remove fake accounts. We have also
significantly increased our investment in security, employing more than
15,000 individuals working solely on security and content review and
planning to increase that number to over 20,000 by the end of the year.
We have also strengthened our advertising policies, seeking to prevent
discrimination while improving transparency.
Senator Hassan. Well, I thank you. My time is up, and I
will follow up with you on that.
Chairman Grassley [presiding]. Senator Capito.
STATEMENT OF HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO,
U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA
Senator Capito. Thank you, Chairman Grassley.
And thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for being here today.
I want to ask just kind of a process question. You have
said more than a few times that Facebook users can delete from
their own account at any time. Well, we know in the course I
do. I have got grandchildren now, but children, you tell your
children once you make that mark in the Internet system, it
never really goes away.
So my question to you is, and I think you answered that
once an individual deletes the information from their page, it
is gone forever from Facebook's archives. Is that correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes. And I think you raise a good point,
though, which is that we will delete it from our systems, but
if you have shared something to someone else, then we cannot
guarantee that they do not have it somewhere else.
Senator Capito. OK. So if somebody leaves Facebook and then
rejoins and asks Facebook can you recreate my past, your answer
would be?
Mr. Zuckerberg. If they delete their account, their answer
is no. That is why we actually offer two options. We offer
deactivation, which allows you to shut down or suspend your
account but not delete the information because actually a lot
of people want to at least for some period of time--and we hear
students with exams coming up want to not be on Facebook
because they want to make sure they can focus on the exam, so
they deactivate their account temporarily but then want the
ability to turn it back on when they are ready.
You can also delete your account, which is wiping
everything, and if you----
Senator Capito. So?
Mr. Zuckerberg.--do that, then you cannot get it back.
Senator Capito. You cannot get it back? It is gone from
your archives?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Capito. But is it ever really gone?
Mr. Zuckerberg. From our systems it is.
Senator Capito. From the cloud or wherever it is. I mean,
it always seems to be able to reappear in investigations and
other things, not necessary Facebook but other e-mails and
other things of that nature.
What about the information going from the past, the
information that has already been in the Cambridge Analytica
case? You cannot really go back and redo that, so I am going to
assume that what we have been talking with and the improvements
that you are making now at Facebook are from this point
forward. Is that a correct assumption?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I actually do think we can go back
in some cases, and that is why one of the things that I
announced is that we are going to be investigating every single
app that had access to a large amount of information before we
lock down the platform in 2014. And if we find any pattern of
suspicious activity, then we are going to go, do a full audit
of their systems. And if we find that anyone is improperly
using data, then we will take action to make sure that they
delete the data, and we will inform everyone who may have had
their data misused.
Senator Capito. OK. The other suggestion I would make
because we are kind of running out of time here is you have
heard more than a few complaints, and I join the chorus, of the
lapse in the time of when you discovered and when you became
transparent. And I understand you sent out two messages just
today to users.
So I would say--you say you regret that decision that you
wish you had been more transparent at the time, so I would
imagine if in the course of your investigation you find more
breaches, so to speak, that you will be re-informing your
Facebook customers?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes, that is correct. We have already
committed that if we find any improper use, we will inform
everyone affected.
Senator Capito. OK. Thank you. You have said also that you
want to have an active view on controlling your ecosystem. Last
week, the FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb addressed a drug
summit in Atlanta and spoke on the national opioid epidemic. My
state, and I am from West Virginia, and thank you for visiting.
And next time you visit if you would please bring some fiber
because we do not have connectivity in our rural areas like we
really need, and Facebook could really help us with that.
So Commissioner Gottlieb called upon social media and
internet service providers, and he mentioned Facebook when he
talked about it, to try to disrupt the sale of illegal drugs
and particularly powerful opioid fentanyl, which has been
advertised and sold online. I know you have policies against
this. The Commissioner is announcing his intention to convene a
meeting of chief executives and senior leaders, and I want to
know, could I get a commitment from you today that Facebook
will commit to having a representative with Commissioner
Gottlieb to finalize with this meeting?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, that sounds like an important
initiative, and we will send someone.
[The information referred to follows:]
Please send someone to the opioid meeting.
Thank you for highlighting this important issue. Yes, we will work
with the Administration to send a Facebook representative. We are
committed to doing our part in combating the opioid crisis and look
forward to a continued dialogue with you.
Senator Capito. OK. And?
Mr. Zuckerberg. And let me also say that on your point
about connectivity, we do have a group in Facebook that is
working on trying to spread Internet connectivity in rural
areas, and we would be happy to follow up with you on that as
well. That is something that I am very passionate about.
Senator Capito. That is good. That is good news.
The last question I have just on the advertising, if
somebody advertises on Facebook and somebody purchases
something, does Facebook get a percentage or any kind of a fee
associated with a successful purchase from an advertiser?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, no. The way that the system works
is advertisers bid how much it is worth it to them to show an
ad or when an action happens. So it is not that we would get a
percent of the sale, but--let us just use an example. So let us
say you are an app developer, and your goal is you want to get
more people to install your app. You could bid in the ad system
and say I will pay $3 any time someone installs this app, and
then we basically calculate on our side which ads are going to
be relevant for people. And we have an incentive to show people
ads that are going to be relevant because we only get paid when
it delivers a business result. And that is how the system
works.
Senator Capito. So you could be paid for the sale?
Mr. Zuckerberg. We get paid when the action that the
advertiser wants to happen happens.
Senator Capito. All right. Thank you.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Cortez Masto.
STATEMENT OF HON. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
Mr. Zuckerberg, thank you. It has been a long afternoon,
and I appreciate you being here and taking the time with every
single one of us.
I am going to echo a lot of what I have heard my colleagues
say today as well. I appreciate you being here, appreciate the
apology, but stop apologizing and let us make the change. I
think it is time to really change the conduct. I appreciate the
fact that you talked about your principles for Facebook, notice
to users on the use of the data and that users have complete
control of their data. But the skepticism that I have--and I am
hoping you can help me with this--is over the last, what, 7
years, 7, 14 years, 7 years, I have not seen really much change
in ensuring that the privacy is there and that individual users
have control over their data.
So let me ask you this. Back in 2009, you made two changes
to your privacy policy, and in fact prior to that most users
could either identify only friends or friends of friends as
part of their privacy, correct, if they wanted to protect their
data? They could identify only friends or friends of friends
who could see their data, is that not correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I believe that we have had the
option for people to share with friends, friends of friends, a
custom audience, or publicly for a long time.
Senator Cortez Masto. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do not remember exactly when we put that
in place, but I believe it was before 2009.
Senator Cortez Masto. So either you can choose only friends
or friends of friends to decide how you are going to protect
that data, correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Those are two of the options, yes.
Senator Cortez Masto. OK. And in 2011 when the FTC started
taking a look at this, they were concerned that if somebody
chose only friends, that the individual user was under the
impression they could continue to restrict sharing of data to
limited audience, but that was not the case. And in fact,
selecting friends only did not prevent users' information from
being shared with their third-party applications their friends
used. Is that not the case? And that is why the FTC was looking
at you and making that change because there was concern that if
you had friends on your page, a third party could access that
information. Is that not correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not remember the exact
context that the----
Senator Cortez Masto. So let me help you here because David
Vladeck, who spent nearly 4 years as Director of the Federal
Trade Commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, where he
worked, including on the FTC's enforcement case against
Facebook, basically identifies in this article that that was
the case, that not only did Facebook misrepresent and that is
why there were eight counts of deceptive acts and practices,
the actual FTC in November's 2011 Decree basically required
Facebook to give users clear and conspicuous notice and to
obtain affirmative--let me jump back here--to do three things.
The decree barred Facebook from making any further deceptive
privacy claims, and it required Facebook get consumers'
approval before changing the way it shares their data. And most
importantly, the third thing, it required Facebook to give
users clear and conspicuous notice and to obtain affirmative
express consent before sharing their data with third parties.
That was part of the FTC consent decree, correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, that sounds right to me.
Senator Cortez Masto. OK. So at that time you were on
notice that there were concerns about the sharing of data and
information, users' data, including those friends with third
parties, correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, my understanding----
Senator Cortez Masto. Well, let me ask you this. Let me do
it this way. In response to the FTC consent to make those
changes, did you make those changes? And what did you do to
ensure individuals' user data was protected and they had notice
of that information and that potentially third parties would be
accessing that and they had to give express consent? What did
you specifically do in response to that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, a number of things. One of the
most important parts of the FTC consent decree that we signed
was establishing a robust privacy program at the company headed
by our chief privacy officer Erin Egan.
Senator Cortez Masto. Can you give me----
Mr. Zuckerberg. We are now----
Senator Cortez Masto.--specifics on it? And I have heard
this over and over again and I am running out of time, but here
is the concern that I have. It cannot be a privacy policy
because that is what the consent said it could not be. It had
to be something very specific, something very simple like you
have heard from my colleagues, and that did not occur. Had that
occurred, we would not be here today talking about Cambridge
Analytica. Is that not really true? Had you addressed those
issues then, had you done an audit, had you looked at not only
the third party applications but they are audited their
associated data storage as well, you would have known that this
type of data information was being shared. And that is our
concern, and that is what I am saying now. It is time just to
make the change. It is time to really address the privacy
issue. It is time to really come and lead the country on this
issue and how we can protect individual user's data and
information.
I know my time is running out, but I appreciate you being
here, and I am just hoping that you are committed to working
with us in the future in addressing these concerns.
Chairman Thune [presiding]. Thank you, Senator Cortez
Masto.
Senator Gardner.
STATEMENT OF HON. CORY GARDNER,
U.S. SENATOR FROM COLORADO
Senator Gardner. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And thank you, Mr. Zuckerberg, for your patience and
testimony today. The end is near I think, one, two, three, or
four people, so that is good news to get out of this hearing.
A couple questions for you. To clarify one of the comments
made about deleting accounts from Facebook, in the user
agreement it says, ``When you delete IP content, it is deleted
in a manner similar to emptying the recycle bin on a computer.
However, you understand that removed content may persist in
backup copies for a reasonable period of time.`` How long is
that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not know sitting here what
our current systems are on that, but the intent is to get all
the content out of the system as quickly as possible.
Senator Gardner. And does that mean your user data as well?
It talks about IP content. Is that the same thing as your user
data? It can sit in backup copies?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think that that is probably
right. I am not sitting here today having full knowledge of our
current state of the systems around wiping all of the data out
of backups, so I can follow up with you on that afterwards. But
what I can tell you is that----
Senator Gardner. But all backups get wiped?
Mr. Zuckerberg. That is certainly the way it is supposed to
work.
Senator Gardner. Has there ever been a failure of that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I do not know. If we tell people
that we are going to delete their data, we need to do that.
Senator Gardner. And you do do that? Thank you.
Mr. Zuckerberg, a couple of other questions. I think that
gets to the heart of this expectation gap as I call it with
users. Facebook, as I understand it, if you are logged into
Facebook with a separate browser and you log into another
article, open a new tab in the browser while you have the
Facebook tab open and that new tab has a Facebook, you know,
button on it, you track the article that you are reading, is
that correct?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think that----
Senator Gardner. In the tab?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I think that there is functionality like
that, yes.
Senator Gardner. Do you think users understand that?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I think that there is a
reasonable--I think the answer is probably yes for the
following reason: because when we show a like button on a
website, we show social context there, so it says here are your
friends who liked that. So in order to do that, we would have
to----
Senator Gardner. But if you have got your Facebook browser
open and you open up an article in the Denver Post and it has a
Facebook button it, do you think they know, consumers, users
know that Facebook now knows what article you are reading in
the Denver Post?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, we would need to have that in order
to serve up the like button and show you who your friends were
who had also liked that.
Senator Gardner. So I think that goes to the heart of this
expectation gap because I do not think consumers, users
necessarily understand that. I mean, in going through this user
agreement, as others have, you do need a lawyer to understand
it. And I hope that you can close that expectation gap by
simplifying the user agreement, making sure that people
understand their privacy.
Has there ever been a violation outside of the talk about
Cambridge Analytica about the privacy settings? Has a privacy
setting violation ever occurred outside of Cambridge Analytica?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I am not aware that we have had systems
that have----
Senator Gardner. So the privacy setting----
Mr. Zuckerberg.--shown content----
Senator Gardner.--a user uses have always been respected?
There has never been an instance where those privacy settings
have been violated?
Mr. Zuckerberg. That is my understanding. I mean, this is
the core thing that our company does is you come to Facebook,
you say, hey, I want to share this photo or I want to----
Senator Gardner. I understand.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--send this message to these people and we
have to----
Senator Gardner. Has there ever been a breach of Facebook
data, a hack?
Mr. Zuckerberg. There have been--I do not believe that
there has been a breach of data that we are aware of.
Senator Gardner. Has there ever been a hack?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Gardner. And have those hacks accessed user data?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do not believe so. I think we had an
instance back in 2013 where someone was able to install some
malware on a few employees' computers and had access to some of
the content on their computers, but I do not believe----
Senator Gardner. Never affected a user page?
Mr. Zuckerberg.--they had access to data.
Senator Gardner. It never affected the user page?
Mr. Zuckerberg. I do not believe so.
Senator Gardner. OK. Has the government ever asked to
remove a page, have a page removed?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I believe so.
Senator Gardner. OK. Can you get a warrant to join a page
to be on a page pretending you are a separate user, to be liked
by that, to track what that person is doing? Do you need a
warrant for that or can the government just do that, the FBI,
anybody?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I am not sure I fully understand.
You are saying to----
Senator Gardner. We can follow up on that because I do have
one final question I want to ask you. A couple days ago, I
think Facebook talked about that it would label traditional
advocacy as political ads. And, for instance, if the Sierra
Club was to run a climate change ad, that would be labeled a
political ad. If the Chamber of Commerce wanted to place an ad
as the climate change regulations would have an impact and talk
about that through an ad, that would be labeled as political,
which is different than current standards of what is political,
what is issue advocacy. Is it your intent to label things
political that would be in contradiction to Federal law?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, the intent of what we are trying
to get at is the foreign election interference that we have
seen has taken more the form of issue ads than direct political
electioneering advertising. So, because of that, we think it is
very important to extend the verification and transparency to
issue ads in order to block the kind of interference that the
Russians attempted to do and I think will likely continue to
attempt to do. That is why I think that those measures are
important to do.
Senator Gardner. Thank you.
Chairman Thune. Thank you, Senator Gardner.
Senator Tester.
STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA
Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to thank you for being here today, Mark. I
appreciate you coming in. I hope this is not the last time we
see you in front of committee. I know we are approaching 5
hours, so it has been a little tenuous, some mental gymnastics
for all of us, and I just want to thank you for being here.
Facebook is an American company, and with that I believe
you have got a responsibility to protect American liberties
central to our privacy. Facebook allowed a foreign company to
steal private information. They allowed a foreign company to
steal private information from tens of millions of Americans
largely without any knowledge of their own. Who and how we
choose to share our opinions is a question of personal freedom.
Who we share our likes and dislikes with is a question of
personal freedom. This is a troubling episode that completely
shatters that liberty, so that you understand the magnitude of
this. Montanans are deeply concerned with this breach of
privacy and trust.
So you have been at this for nearly 5 hours today. So
besides taking reactive steps--and I want you to be as concise
as you possibly can--what are you doing to make sure what
Cambridge Analytica did never happens again?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Thank you, Senator. There are three
important steps that we are taking here. For Cambridge
Analytica, first of all, we need to finish resolving this, by
doing a full audit of their systems to make sure that they
delete all the data that they have and so we can fully
understand what happened.
There are two sets of steps that we are taking to make sure
that this does not happen again. The most important is
restricting the amount of access to information that developers
will have going forward. The good news here is that back in
2014 we actually had already made a large change to restrict
access on the platform that would have prevented this issue
with Cambridge Analytica from happening again today. Clearly,
we did not do that soon enough. If we had done it a couple of
years earlier, then we probably would not be sitting here
today. But this is not a change that we had to take now in
2018. It is largely a change that we did back in 2014.
Senator Tester. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg. There are other parts of the platform that
we also similarly can lock down now to make sure that other
issues that might have been exploited in the future will not be
able to. And we have taken a number of those steps, and I have
outlined those in my written statement as well.
Senator Tester. I appreciate that. And you feel confident
that the actions that you have taken thus far, whether it was
the ones back in 2014 or the one that you just talked about,
about locking down the other parts, will adequately protect the
folks who use Facebook?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, I believe so----
Senator Tester. OK.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--although security is never a solved
problem.
Senator Tester. That is all I need. You talked about a full
audit of Cambridge Analytica's systems. Can you do a full audit
if that information is stored in some other country?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, right now, we are waiting on the
audit because the U.K. Government is doing a government
investigation of them.
Senator Tester. OK. But----
Mr. Zuckerberg. And I do believe that the government will
have the ability to get into the systems even if we cannot.
Senator Tester. If information is stored in the U.K., but
what if it is stored in some other country? What if the
information is stored in some other country? Is an audit even
possible?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, Senator, we believe a bunch of the
information that we will be able to audit. I think you raise an
important question, and if we have issues, then we--if we are
not able to do an audit to our satisfaction, we are going to
take legal action to enable us to do that. And also, I know
that the U.K. and U.S. Governments are also involved in working
on this as well.
Senator Tester. I am telling you I would have faith in the
U.S. Government. I really actually have faith in the U.K., too.
There have been claims that this information is being stored in
Russia. I do not care. It could be stored anywhere in the
world. I do not know how you get access to that information. I
am not as smart as you are about tech information, and so the
question really becomes--and I have got to move on, but the
question is I do not see how you can perform a full audit if
they have got stuff stored somewhere else that we cannot get
access to. That is all. Maybe you have other ideas on how to do
that.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Well, I think we will know once we get in
there whether we feel like we can fully investigate everything.
Senator Tester. Just real quickly, Senator Schatz asked a
question earlier about data and who owns the data. I want to
dig into it a little bit more. You said--and I think multiple
times during this hearing--that I own the data on Facebook if
it is my data.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes.
Senator Tester. And I am going to tell you that I think
that that sounds really good to me, but in practice, let us
think about this for a second. You are making about 40 billion
bucks a year on the data. I am not making any money on it. It
feels like you own the data. And in fact, I would say that the
data that was breached through Cambridge Analytica, which
impacted--and correct me if these numbers are wrong--some 80
million Americans, my guess is that few if any knew that that
information was being breached. If I own that data, I know it
is being breached.
So could you give me some sort of idea on how you can
really honestly say it is my data when, quite frankly, they may
have goods on me. I do not want them to have any information on
me.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, when I say it is----
Senator Tester. If I own it, I can stop it.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Yes. So, Senator, when I say it is your
data, what I mean is that you have control over how it is used
on Facebook. You clearly need to give Facebook a license to use
it within our system----
Senator Tester. Yes.
Mr. Zuckerberg.--or else the service does not work.
Senator Tester. Yes, I know, and this license has been
brought up many times today. And I am going to be quiet in just
one second, Mr. Chairman.
But the fact is is the license is very thick, maybe
intentionally so, so people get tired of reading it and do not
want to.
Look, Mark, I appreciate you being here. I look forward to
having you at another hearing.
Chairman Grassley [presiding]. Senator Young.
STATEMENT OF HON. TODD YOUNG,
U.S. SENATOR FROM INDIANA
Senator Young. Mr. Zuckerberg, thanks so much for being
here enduring the many questions today. I think it is important
you are here because your social media platform happens to be
the ubiquitous social media platform. And there is not a
Senator that you heard from today that is not on Facebook, that
does not communicate with our constituents through Facebook. In
a sense, we have to be on it, and so I think it is especially
important that you are here not just for Facebook but really
for our country and beyond.
The threshold question that continues to emerge here today
is, what are the reasonable expectations of privacy that users
ought to have? And, I will tell you, my neighbors are
unsatisfied by an answer to that question that involves, you
know, take a look at the User Agreement. And I think there has
been a fair amount of discussion here about whether or not
people actually read that User Agreement. I would encourage you
to, you know, survey that, get all the information you can with
respect to that, and make sure that user agreement is easy to
understand and streamlined and so forth.
Mr. Zuckerberg, earlier in today's hearing, you drew a
distinction that I thought was interesting. It caught my
attention. It was a distinction between consumer expectation of
privacy depending upon whether they were on an ISP or the pipes
of the Internet as you characterized it or on an edge platform
like Facebook. I find this distinction somewhat unsatisfying
because most folks who use the Internet just think of it as one
place if you will. They think of it as the Internet as opposed
to various places requiring different degrees of privacy.
Could you speak to this issue and indicate whether you
would support a comprehensive privacy policy that applies in
the same manner to all entities across the entire internet
ecosystem?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, sure. I think that people's
expectations of how they use these different systems are
different. Some apps are very lightweight, and you can fully
encrypt the data going across them in a way that the app
developer or the pipes in the ISP case probably should not be
able to see any of the content. And I think you probably should
have a full expectation that no one is going to be
introspecting or looking at that content. Other services----
Senator Young. Give me some quick examples if you would
kindly, sir.
Mr. Zuckerberg. Sure. Well, when data is going over the
Verizon network, I think it would be good for that to be as
encrypted as possible and such that Verizon would not look at
it, right? I think that that is what people expect, and I do
not know that being able to look at the data is required to
deliver their service. That is how WhatsApp works, too, so that
is an app. It is a very lightweight app. It does not require us
to know a lot of information about you, so we can offer that
with full encryption, and therefore, we do not see the content.
For a service like Facebook or Instagram where you are
sharing photos and then people want to access them from lots of
different places, people kind of want to store that in a
central place so that way they can go access it from lots of
different devices. In order to do that, we need to have an
understanding of what that content is, so I think the
expectations of what Facebook will have knowledge of versus
what an ISP will have knowledge of are just different.
Senator Young. I think that needs to be clearly
communicated to your users, and we will leave it at that, that
those different levels of privacy that the user can expect to
enjoy when they are on your platform.
I would like to sort of take a different tack to internet
privacy policy with you, sir. Might we create stronger privacy
rights for consumers either through creating a stronger general
property right regime online, say a new law that states
unequivocally something that you have said before, that users
own their online data or through stronger affirmative opt-in
requirements on platforms like yours. Now, if we were to do
that, would you need to retool your model if we were to adopt
one of those two approaches?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, could you repeat what the
approaches are again?
Senator Young. Yes, so one is to create a stronger property
right for the individual online through a law that states
unequivocally----
Mr. Zuckerberg. OK.
Senator Young.--users own their data. The other one is a
stronger affirmative opt-in requirement to be a user on
Facebook. Would you have to fundamentally change the Facebook
architecture to accommodate those policies?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, those policies and the principles
that you articulated are generally how we view our service
already, so depending on the details of what the proposal
actually ends up being, and the details do just matter a huge
amount here, it is not clear that it would be a fundamental
shift. But the details really matter, and if this is something
you are considering or working on, we would love to follow up
with you on this because this is very important to get right.
[The information referred to follows:]
Might we create stronger privacy rights for consumers through
creating a stronger general property right regime online, say a law
states that users own their online data or stronger opt in requirements
on platforms like yours? If we're to do that, would you need to retool
your model? If we're to adopt one of the two approaches?
Our Terms of Service confirm that people own the information they
shared on Facebook. They entrust it to us to use it consistent with our
Terms and Data Policy to provide meaningful and useful services to
them. They have the ability to choose who can see it, delete it, or
take it with them if they want to do so. We're also rolling out a new
Privacy Shortcuts feature, which centralizes a broad range of choices
that people have about how their information is used as a part of the
Facebook service, and we're contacting people on our service to ask
them to make choices about these issues as well.
Facebook already allows users to download a copy of their
information from Facebook. This functionality, which we've offered for
many years, includes numerous categories of data, including About Me,
Account Status History, Apps, Chat, Follower, Following, Friends,
Messages, Networks, Notes, and more. We recently launched improvements
to our ``Download Your Information'' tool, including to give people
choices about whether they want to download only certain types of
information and about the format in which they want to receive the
download, to make it easier for people to use their information once
they've retrieved it.
Of course, the details of any new privacy legislation matter, and
we would be pleased to discuss any specific proposals with you and your
staff.
Senator Young. I would love to work with you. I am out of
time. Thank you.
Chairman Grassley. Senator Thune has a closing comment
and----
Chairman Thune. Yes.
Chairman Grassley.--and I have a process statement for
everybody to listen to.
Chairman Thune. Mr. Chairman, thank you. And thanks to all
of our Members for their patience. It has been a long hearing,
a particularly long hearing for you, Mr. Zuckerberg. Thank you
for sitting through this. But I think this is important.
I do have a letter here from the Motion Picture Association
of America that I want to get into the record. Without
objection.
Chairman Grassley. Without objection, so ordered.
[The information referred to follows:]
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Chairman Thune. And then just a quick, sort of, wrap-up
question if you will and maybe one quick comment, but you have
answered several questions today about efforts to keep bad
actors, whether that is a terrorist group to a malicious
foreign agent, off of your platform. You have also heard
concerns about bias at Facebook, particularly bias against
conservatives. And just as a final question, can you assure us
that when you are improving tools to stop bad actors that you
will err on the side of protecting speech, especially political
speech, from all different corners?
Mr. Zuckerberg. Senator, yes. That is our approach. If
there is an imminent threat of harm, we are going to take a
conservative position on that and make sure that we flag that
and understand that more broadly. But overall, I want to make
sure that we provide people with the most voice possible. I
want the widest possible expression, and I do not want anyone
at our company to make any decisions based on the political
ideology of the content.
Chairman Thune. And just one final observation, Chairman
Grassley. Mr. Zuckerberg has answered a lot of questions today,
but there are also a lot of promises to follow up with some of
our members and sometimes on questions about Facebook practices
that seem fairly straightforward. I think it is going to be
hard for us to fashion solutions to solve some of this stuff
until we have some of those answers. And you had indicated
earlier that you are continuing to try and find out who among
these other analytics companies may have had access to user
data that they were able to use. And hopefully, as you get
those answers, you will be able to forward those to us, and it
will help shape our thinking in terms of where we go from here.
But overall, I think it was a very informative hearing, Mr.
Chairman, and so I am ready to wrap it up.
Chairman Grassley. Yes. I probably would not make this
comment, but your response to him in regard to political
speech, I will not identify the CEO I had a conversation with
yesterday, but one of our platforms, and he admitted to being
more left than right--or, I mean, being left I guess is what he
admitted. And I am not asking you what you are, but just so you
understand that probably as liberals have a lot of concerns
about, you know, the leaning of Fox News or conservatives have
questions about the leaning of MSNBC let us say, it seems to me
that when we get--whether it is from the right or the left, so
I am speaking to you for your platform, there is a great deal
of cynicism in American society about government generally.
And then when there are suspicions, legitimate or not, that
maybe you are playing it one way unfairly toward the other, it
seems to me that everything you do to lean over backwards to
make sure that you are fair in protecting political speech,
right or left, that you ought to do it. And I am not telling
you how to do it, and I am not saying you do not do it, but we
have got to do something to reduce this cynicism.
At my town meetings in Iowa, I always get this question:
How come you guys in D.C. cannot get along, you know, meaning
Republicans and Democrats. Well, I try to explain to them that
they kind of get an obtuse--what would say--review of what goes
on here because controversy makes news, so if people are
getting along, you never hear about that, so they get a
distorted view of it. And really, Congressmen get along more
than the public thinks.
But these attitudes of the public, we have got to change,
and people of your position and your influence, you can do a
lot to change this. I know you have got plenty of time to run
your corporation. Through your corporation or privately,
anything you can do to reduce this cynicism because we have a
perfect Constitution--maybe it is not perfect, but we have got
a very good Constitution and the longest written Constitution
in the history of mankind. But if people do not have faith in
the institutions of government and then it is our
responsibility to enhance that faith so they have less cynicism
on us, you know, we do not have a very strong democracy just
because we have got a good Constitution.
So I hope that everybody will do whatever they can to help
enhance respect for government, including speaking to myself, I
have got to bend over backward to do what I can so I do not add
to that cynicism. So I am sorry you had to listen to me.
[Laughter.]
Chairman Grassley. And so this concludes today's hearing.
Thanks to all the witnesses for attending. The record will be
open for 14 days for the Members to submit additional written
questions and for the witness, Mr. Zuckerberg, to make any
corrections to his testimony.
The hearing is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 7:24 p.m., the Committees were adjourned.]
A P P E N D I X
Committee For Justice
Washington, DC, April 10, 2018
Hon. Chuck Grassley,
Chairman,
Senate Committee on the Judiciary.
Hon. Dianne Feinstein,
Ranking Member,
Senate Committee on the Judiciary.
RE: Facebook, Social Media Privacy, and the Use and Abuse of Data
Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Feinstein,
We write to you regarding your April 10 hearing, ``Facebook, Social
Media Privacy, and the Use and Abuse of Data.'' We, the president and
public policy director of the Committee for Justice (CFJ), are
concerned that the hearing will lead to the introduction of new
legislation regulating online data collection and use. We are convinced
such legislation is not only unnecessary but, if enacted, would also
hurt consumers, threaten the online ecosystem that has transformed our
daily lives, and negatively impact our country's economic growth.
Founded in 2002, CFJ is a nonprofit, nonpartisan legal and policy
organization that educates the public and policymakers about and
promotes the rule of law and constitutionally limited government.
Consistent with this mission, CFJ engages in the national debate about
a variety of tech policy issues, including advocating for digital
privacy protections in Congress, the Federal courts, and the news
media.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We have concluded that a legislative solution to the data privacy
issues being discussed at the hearing would be detrimental to our
Nation for the following reasons:
Government-imposed restrictions on data collection would
undercut economic growth, the vibrancy of the online ecosystem,
and consumer satisfaction. In recent decades, consumers'
personal and professional lives have been transformed for the
better by a vast collection of data-driven online resources
that are made available to consumers for no cost because they
are subsidized by advertising. These resources have also been
an engine of economic growth, even during difficult economic
times. For example, more than 70 million small businesses now
use Facebook to grow and create jobs.\2\ In particular, data-
driven marketing, at issue in this hearing, is estimated to
have added more than $200 billion to the U.S. economy in 2014,
a 35 percent increase over just two years earlier.\3\
Government-imposed restrictions on such marketing would slow or
reverse this economic growth, while hurting consumers by
causing the demise of many of the data-driven online resources
they rely on.

Legislation designed to reign in big companies like Facebook
will inevitably harm small companies and tech startups the
most. When regulations restrict companies' ability to collect
and use data, advertisers and other online companies experience
decreased revenue. Large companies can typically survive these
decreases in revenue, while small companies are often driven
out of business. The vast majority of Internet companies fall
in the latter category and include the very companies that
might otherwise grow to compete with and even supplant Facebook
and the other tech giants of today. The European Union's
Privacy and Electronic Communications Directive (2002/58/EC)
provides an unfortunate example of the harm privacy regulations
can inflict on small businesses.\4\ It is one reason why there
are relatively few technology start-ups in Europe and most of
them struggle to receive venture capital funding.\5\

The best way to provide consumers with data privacy
solutions that meet their needs is competition in the Internet
marketplace. In contrast, increased government regulation of
data privacy will stifle competition, in part because only
larger companies can afford the increased compliance costs and
reductions in revenue. This hearing will undoubted include
questions about balancing the tradeoffs between privacy and the
ability to share our lives, make our voices heard, and build
online communities through social media. It makes little sense
for Congress to impose a one-size-fits-all answer to these
questions, given that individuals value the tradeoffs very
differently. Addressing data privacy through competition, on
the other hand, allows consumers to answer these questions for
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
themselves according to their individual values.
Public opinion polls showing support for stronger data
protections are misleading because they rarely confront
consumers with the monetary of and other costs of their
choices.\6\ A 2016 study found that, despite most participants'
unease with an e-mail provider using automated content analysis
to provide more targeted advertisements, 65 percent of them
were unwilling to pay providers any amount for a privacy-
protecting alternative.\7\ However, in the real world,
consumers will lose free e-mail and social media if government-
imposed privacy regulations cut into providers' advertising
revenue. Moreover, such studies remind us that most consumers
do not value data privacy enough to pay anything for it. That
should not be too surprising considering that today's thriving
but largely unregulated social media ecosystem is not something
that was thrust upon consumers or arose from factors beyond
their control. Instead, it arose through the collective choices
and values tradeoffs of billions of consumers.

New, punitive data privacy legislation is unnecessary
because legal safeguards already exist. In addition to industry
self-regulation, consumers of social media and other Internet
services are protected by the Federal Trade Commission's
vigorous enforcement of its data privacy and security
standards, using the prohibition against ``unfair or
deceptive'' business practices in Section 5 of the Federal
Trade Commission Act 15 U.S.C. Sec. 45(a).\8\ In addition,
state attorneys general enforce similar laws at the state
level.\9\

The Cambridge Analytica incident that sparked this hearing
must be put in perspective. It is important to remember that
the personal data disclosed by Facebook to an academic app
builder named Aleksandr Kogan was not the sort of highly
private data--credit card numbers, health records, and the
like--that is sometimes stolen by hackers to the great
detriment of consumers.\10\ The data disclosed by Facebook came
from the profiles of its users and consisted mostly of names,
hometowns, and page likes--in other words, the type of data
most people on Facebook are public about.\11\ However, even
that data is no longer available to app developers today. Kogan
got the idea before Facebook tightened its data privacy
policies in 2014.\12\ Finally, the concern that has focused so
much attention on the Kogan incident--claims that the data was
used by Cambridge Analytica to put Donald Trump over the top in
2016--have little basis in fact. Cambridge used the Facebook
data to run voter-targeted ads for political campaigns, but it
appears that those ads were neither effective nor used in the
Trump campaign.\13\

Because there is no crisis requiring urgent action and
because no one yet fully understands the extent and nature of
the privacy risks posed by Facebook's now discontinued
policies, calls for government-imposed regulation are
premature. Replacing the light-touch regulation of data privacy
currently provided by the FTC and state law with more heavy-
handed Federal legislation should be a last resort, not the
reflexive response to news headlines. Consider also that the
Cambridge Analytica incident would not be dominating the news
but for the report, apparently incorrect, that the data in
question was used to elect Donald Trump president.\14\ Nor
would the news coverage be so negative. Contrast that with the
widely documented use of Facebook data in Barack Obama's 2012
presidential campaign, which was portrayed in a vastly
different light by the news media and did not set off calls for
Congressional hearings or new privacy legislation.\15\ The
important point is that allowing unhappiness with the 2016
election results to drive a push for increased government
regulation and control of the Internet is a very bad way to
make policy.

A rush to enact date privacy legislation is particularly
dangerous in light of the glacial pace with which Congress will
respond to the need for modernizing the legislation as
technology rapidly evolves. Consider the example of the
Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA), which
governs law enforcement's access to stored electronic data,
such as e-mails. As storage of such data moved to the cloud,
the ECPA became hopelessly obsolete, leading to increasingly
concerned calls for its modernization from industry, law
enforcement, and the White House. Despite those calls, it took
many years for Congress to act by passing the Clarifying Lawful
Overseas Use of Data or CLOUD Act in March of this year. And
even then, Congress acted primarily because a Supreme Court
case, U.S. v. Microsoft, forced them to.\16\ There is good
reason to believe that any legislation that comes out of this
hearing will similarly remain in effect, unchanged, long after
today's technological and privacy landscape has morphed into
something we cannot fathom in 2018. In contrast, the self-
regulation continuously being improved by Facebook and similar
companies not only allows adaptation to technological change
with far greater speed but also allows those companies to
tailor data privacy solutions to the specific features of their
platforms, rather than trying to conform with a one-size-fits-
all Federal mandate.

In sum, rushing to enact new legislation regulating online data
collection and use would hinder innovation in the rapidly evolving
world of social media and data-driven marketing, lessen consumer
choice, and negatively impact our Nation's economic growth.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. In its April 2, 2018, response to the letter Sen.
Wicker, Sen. Moran, and I sent you on March 19, 2018, Facebook
committed to investigating all apps that potentially had access to the
same type of data as Cambridge Analytica to identify other misuses of
such data. Will you commit to having Facebook brief Commerce Committee
staff on a periodic basis regarding the progress of these
investigations and any future developments in Facebook's efforts to
combat data misuse more generally?
Answer. We are in the process of investigating every app that had
access to a large amount of information before we changed our Platform
in 2014. The investigation process is in full swing, and it has two
phases. First, a comprehensive review to identify every app that had
access to this amount of Facebook data and to focus on apps that
present reason for deeper investigation. And second, where we have
concerns, we will conduct interviews, make requests for information
(RFI)--which ask a series of detailed questions about the app and the
data it has access to--and perform audits using expert firms that may
include on-site inspections. We have large teams of internal and
external experts working hard to investigate these apps as quickly as
possible. To date thousands of apps have been investigated and around
200 apps have been suspended--pending a thorough investigation into
whether they did in fact misuse any data. Where we find evidence that
these or other apps did misuse data, we will ban them and let people
know.
These apps relate to a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You,
the Cambridge Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality, with many of the
suspended apps being affiliated with the same entity. Many of these
suspensions include apps that appear to be ``test'' apps that were
never released to the public, and therefore would not have acquired
significant user data, although our investigation into these apps is
ongoing.
Additionally, we have suspended an additional 14 apps, which were
installed by around one thousand people. They were all created after
2014, after we made changes to more tightly restrict our platform APIs
to prevent abuse. However, these apps appear to be linked to AIQ, which
was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica. So, we have suspended them
while we investigate further. Any app that refuses to take part in or
fails our audit will be banned.
We will commit to briefing your staff on future developments.
Question 2. Mr. Zuckerberg, as you know, Sen. Wicker, Sen. Moran,
and I sent a letter to you on March 19, requesting answers to several
questions regarding Facebook's privacy practices. Facebook's general
counsel sent a response letter on April 2nd that did not adequately
answer some of the questions posed, saying that Facebook's review of
the matter is ongoing. Will you commit to providing additional answers
to our questions in writing in a timely manner as you learn more?
Answer. We responded to your questions to the best of our ability
based on accessible data and information. Should additional or revised
information related to the questions come to light, we respectfully
request an opportunity to supplement or amend our response as needed.
Question 3. Mr. Zuckerberg, at the hearing you responded to over 20
questions from a number of Senators by saying that you would have to
follow up at a later date. As you compile the promised information,
please provide all such responses to these questions to Commerce
Committee staff in addition to the Senator who posed the question.
Answer. Today we are submitting responses to the questions posed at
the hearing requiring follow-up.
Question 4. Mr. Zuckerberg, given the concerns raised by a number
of Senators that Facebook's user agreement is too opaque to give users
a real understanding of how their data may be used and how they can
control their data privacy, do you intend to make any changes to the
user agreement? If so, please summarize those changes and why you
believe they will make the agreement more easily understood.
Answer. We believe that it's important to communicate with people
about the information that we collect and how people can control it.
This is why we work hard to provide this information to people in a
variety of ways: in our Data Policy, and in Privacy Basics, which
provides walkthroughs of the most common privacy questions we receive.
Beyond simply disclosing our practices, we also think it's important to
give people access to their own information, which we do through our
Download Your Information and Access Your Information tools, Activity
Log, and Ad Preferences, all of which are accessible through our
Privacy Shortcuts tool. We also provide information about these topics
as people are using the Facebook service itself.
While ``up front'' information like that contained in the terms of
service are useful, research overwhelmingly demonstrates that in-
product controls and education are the most meaningful to people and
the most likely to be read and understood. On-demand controls are also
important, and we recently redesigned our entire settings menu on
mobile devices from top to bottom to make things easier to find. We
also created a new Privacy Shortcuts, a menu where users can control
their data in just a few taps, with clearer explanations of how our
controls work. The experience is now clearer, more visual, and easy-to-
find.
Improving people's understanding of how digital services work is an
industry-wide challenge that we are highly committed to addressing.
That's why, over the last 18 months, we've run a global series of
design workshops called ``Design Jams,'' bringing together experts in
design, privacy, law, and computer science to work collaboratively on
new and innovative approaches. These workshops have run in Paris,
London, Dublin, Berlin, Sao Paolo, Hong Kong, and other cities, and
included global regulators and policymakers. At these workshops, expert
teams use ``people centric design'' methods to create innovative new
design prototypes and experiences to improve transparency and education
in digital services. These workshops inform Facebook's constantly-
improving approach.
In recognition of the need for improved approaches to data
transparency across all digital services, working with partners from
academia, design, and industry we recently launched TTC Labs, a design
innovation lab that seeks to improve user experiences around personal
data. TTC Labs is an open platform for sharing and innovation and
contains insights from leading experts in academia, design and law, in
addition to prototype designs from the Design Jams, template services
and open-source toolkits for people-centric design for transparency,
trust and control of data. Working collaboratively, and based on open-
source approaches, TTC Labs seeks to pioneer new and more people-
centric best practices for people to understand how their data is used
by digital services, in ways that they find easy to understand and
control.
Facebook is highly committed to improving people's experience of
its own services as well as investing in new innovations and approaches
to support improvements across the industry.
Question 5. Mr. Zuckerberg, in the weeks since the revelations
regarding Cambridge Analytica, the Committee has become aware that
Facebook has surveyed users about whether they trust the company to
safeguard their privacy. Please provide the Commerce Committee with the
results of any such survey.
Answer. Privacy is at the core of everything we do, and our
approach to privacy starts with our commitment to transparency and
control. Our threefold approach to transparency includes, first,
whenever possible, providing information on the data we collect and use
and how people can control it in context and in our products. Second,
we provide information about how we collect and use data in our user
agreements and related educational materials. And third, we enable
people to learn more about the specific data we have about them through
interactive tools such as Download Your Information, which lets people
download a file containing data that they may want to take to another
service, and Access Your Information, a tool we are launching that will
let people more easily access and manage their data on Facebook.
Our approach to control is based on the belief that people should
be able to choose who can see what they share and how their data shapes
their experience on Facebook. People can control the audience for their
posts and the apps that can receive their data. They can see and delete
the history of their activities on Facebook, and, if they no longer
want to use Facebook, they can delete their account and the data
associated with it. Of course, we recognize that controls are only
useful if people know how to find and use them. That is why we
continuously deliver in-product educational videos in people's News
Feeds on important privacy topics. We are also inviting people to take
our Privacy Checkup--which prompts people to review key data controls--
and we are sharing privacy tips in education campaigns off of Facebook,
including through ads on other websites. To make our privacy controls
easier to find, we are launching a new settings menu that features core
privacy settings in a single place. We are always working to help
people understand and control how their data shapes their experience on
Facebook.
Question 6. Mr. Zuckerberg, when did you personally become aware of
Cambridge Analytica's breach of your policies in 2014-2015, and when
did you personally become aware that Cambridge Analytica had not in
fact deleted the data they obtained despite certifying otherwise?
Answer. On December 11, 2015, The Guardian published an article
reporting that Kogan and his company, GSR, may have passed information
the app had obtained from Facebook users to SCL Elections Ltd. (SCL)/
Cambridge Analytica. As part of its investigation, Facebook contacted
Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to investigate the allegations reflected
in the reporting. Thereafter, Facebook obtained written certifications
or confirmations from Kogan, GSR, and other third parties (including
Cambridge Analytica and SCL) declaring that all such data they had
obtained was accounted for and destroyed. In March 2018, Facebook
received information from the media suggesting that the certification
we received from SCL may not have been accurate and immediately banned
SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica from purchasing advertising on our
platform. Since then, Facebook has been actively investigating the
issue, including pursuing a forensic audit of Cambridge Analytica,
which is currently paused at the request of the UK Information
Commissioner's Office (which is separately investigating Cambridge
Analytica).
Mr. Zuckerberg did not become aware of allegations that Cambridge
Analytica may not have deleted data about Facebook users obtained from
Kogan's app until March of 2018, when these issues were raised in the
media.
Question 7. On April 24, 2018, Facebook announced that it would
institute an appeals process for posts that Facebook removes for
violating its community standards. This process will initially only be
available for posts that were removed for nudity/sexual activity, hate
speech, or graphic violence. Why did Facebook decide to launch its
appeals process for these categories? Prior to this new appeals
process, did Facebook users have any recourse if their post was
removed?
Answer. Prior to April 24, 2018, appeals generally were only
available to people whose profiles, Pages, or Groups had been taken
down, but we had not yet been able to implement an appeals process at
the content level.
On April 24, we announced the launch of appeals for content that
was removed for nudity/sexual activity, hate speech, and graphic
violence. We focused on starting with these content violations
initially based on feedback from our community.
We are working to extend this process further, by: supporting more
violation types; giving people the opportunity to provide more context
that could help us make the right decision; and making appeals
available not just for content that was taken down, but also for
content that was reported and left up.
Question 8. In your testimony, you discussed two typical business
models employed by social media companies to make content available to
users: an advertising-supported model and a subscription-based model.
If Facebook were to shift from an advertising model to a subscription
model, how much would consumers expect to pay in order to access
Facebook content? Would you ever consider making such a shift? If not,
why not?
Answer. Like many other free online services, we sell advertising
space to third parties. Doing so enables us to offer our services to
consumers for free. This is part of our mission to give people the
power to build community and bring the world closer together.
Question 9. According to your testimony, Facebook has found that,
while some users don't like advertisements, ``people really don't like
ads that aren't relevant'' and the ``overwhelming feedback we get from
our community is that people would rather have us show relevant
content.'' Can you elaborate on your basis for these statements about
user preferences?
Answer. Part of Facebook's goal is to deliver the right content to
the right people at the right time. This is just as true of posts and
other content in users' News Feeds as it is for ads in their News Feed.
And to choose the right ads Facebook listens to what feedback users
provide. Users frequently provide feedback about what ads they want to
see and don't want to see; they interact with ads positively (clicks,
likes, comments, or shares) and negatively (by hiding the ad). Facebook
takes all of this into consideration when selecting ads for its users.
In conjunction with this user feedback, Facebook has been working
to better understand people's concerns with online ads. For example,
Facebook has conducted multi-method, multi-market research surrounding
ad blocking and personalization expectations among consumers. And the
take away from this has been that people don't like to see ads that are
irrelevant to them or that disrupt or break their experience.
Furthermore, people like to have control over the kinds of ads they
see. For these reasons, Facebook seeks to provide users more relevant
ads, as well as the tools to improve their control over which ads they
see.
Question 10. You stated that ``there is some discomfort . . . with
using information in making ads more relevant.'' Why do you believe
Facebook users feel this discomfort? Do you believe users would feel
more comfortable if they had a clearer understanding of the
relationship between their information, the relevance of the
advertisements they are served, and Facebook's ability to offer content
without charging subscription fees?
Answer. We maintain our commitment to privacy by not telling
advertisers who users are or selling people's information to anyone.
That has always been true. We think relevant advertising and privacy
are not in conflict, and we're committed to doing both well.
We believe targeted advertising creates value for people and
advertisers who use Facebook. Being able to target ads to the people
most likely to be interested in the products, service or causes being
advertised enables businesses and other organizations to run effective
campaigns at reasonable prices. This efficiency has particularly
benefited small businesses, which make up the vast majority of the six
million active advertisers on Facebook. That said, we are keenly aware
of the concerns about the potential of our tools to be abused. That is
why we are investing heavily in improving the security and integrity of
our platform.
Separately, our core service involves personalizing all content,
features and recommendations that people see on Facebook services. No
two people have the same experience on Facebook or Instagram, and they
come to our services because they expect everything they see to be
relevant to them. If we were not able to personalize or select ads or
other content based on relevance, this would fundamentally change the
service we offer on Facebook--and it would no longer be Facebook.
We do not have a ``business reason'' to compromise the personal
data of users; we have a business reason to protect that information.
Our mission is to build community and bring the world closer together,
but it is not enough to just connect people, we have to make sure those
connections are positive. If people's experiences are not positive--if
we fail to maintain their trust--they will not use our services.
Question 11. Mr. Zuckerberg, how does Facebook determine whether
and for how long to store user data or delete user data?
Answer. In general, when a user deletes their account, we delete
things they have posted, such as their photos and status updates, and
they won't be able to recover that information later. (Information that
others have shared about them isn't part of their account and won't be
deleted.)
There are some limited exceptions to these policies: For instance,
information can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when
it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental
investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or
policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from
accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent
repeat abuse or other term violations.
Question 12. Mr. Zuckerberg, you have discussed how a Facebook user
can learn what data Facebook has collected about him or her. How can a
non-user learn what data, if any, Facebook has collected about him or
her?
Answer. If a person doesn't have a Facebook account but believes
Facebook may have information about them, they can contact us to
request a copy of their information. A contact form is available at
https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/180237
885820953. However, Facebook does not create profiles about or track
web or app browser behavior of non-users.
Question 13. Does Facebook continue to track users who have turned
off personalized ads? If so, why? Provide a list of uses Facebook makes
of the data of users who have disabled personalized ads.
Answer. When people visit apps or websites that feature our
technologies--like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers
automatically log (i) standard browser or app records of the fact that
a particular device or user visited the website or app (this connection
to Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a
website or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button,
and is an inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any
additional information the publisher of the app or website chooses to
share with Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as
the fact that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard
feature of the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same
information with multiple different third-parties whenever people visit
their website or app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's
website shares information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick
and with the analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a
person visits the Committee's website, it sends browser information
about the visit to each one of those third parties. More information
about how this works is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/
04/data-off-facebook/.
Question 14. Is Facebook's use of a user's data on the Facebook
platform for targeted advertising a condition of using Facebook?
Answer. Users can't opt out of seeing ads altogether because
selling ads is what keeps Facebook free, but they do have different
options to control how their data can and can't be used to show them
ads. They're all found in ad preferences, which allows users to turn
off the use of all data collected from partners off Facebook to target
ads.
Users can also decide which of their profile fields they want used
for ad targeting in the Information section under ``About you.'' Users
can remove themselves from interests under ``Your interests'' and
categories under ``Your categories.''
Question 15. Mr. Zuckerberg, on March 25, you took out several
full-page ads in newspapers around the world in which you stated:
``We're also investigating every single app that had access to large
amounts of data before we fixed this,'' referring to your 2014 policy
changes. You went on to say, ``We expect there are others. And when we
find them, we will ban them and tell everyone affected.'' How many
other offending apps have you found so far? You mentioned, when you
find offending apps, you will be notifying users. Please also provide a
list of these apps to Congress.
Answer. See Response to Question 1.
Question 16. Mr. Zuckerberg, as you may know, Carol Davidsen, who
in 2012 served as the Obama campaign's director of data integration and
media analytics, reportedly asserted that Facebook allowed the campaign
to access users' personal data ``because they were on our side.'' Did
Facebook give preferential treatment to the Obama campaign with respect
to data access in 2012? With respect to data access, did Facebook
discriminate between the presidential campaigns in 2016?
Answer. Both the Obama and Romney campaigns had access to the same
tools, and no campaign received any special treatment from Facebook.
Likewise, we offered identical support to both the Trump and Clinton
campaigns, and had teams assigned to both. Everyone had access to the
same tools, which are the same tools that every campaign is offered.
Question 17. Since 2011, Facebook has been operating under a
consent order issued by the Federal Trade Commission following agency
charges that Facebook had deceived consumers by failing to keep privacy
promises to them. You have indicated that--without prejudging the FTC's
decision to investigate the Cambridge Analytica incident--you do not
believe the consent order is implicated in the current matter. Please
explain why.
Answer. We furnished extensive information to the FTC regarding the
ability for users to port their Facebook data (including friends data
that had been shared with them) with apps on Facebook's platform, as
part of the FTC's investigation culminating in the July 27, 2012
Consent Order. The Consent Order memorializes the agreement between
Facebook and the FTC and did not require Facebook to turn off the
ability for people to port friends data that had been shared with them
on Facebook to apps they used. Facebook voluntarily changed this
feature of the Platform in 2014, however.
Among other things, the consent order obligates Facebook not to
misrepresent the extent to which it maintains the privacy or security
of covered information (Section I), not to materially exceed the
restrictions of a privacy setting that applies to nonpublic user
information without affirmative express consent (Section II), and to
implement a comprehensive privacy program that is subjected to ongoing
review by an independent assessor (Sections IV and V). Facebook
accurately represented the operation of its developer Platform and the
circumstances under which people could share data (including friends
data) with developers, honored the restrictions of all privacy settings
that covered developer access to data, and implemented a comprehensive
privacy program build on industry-leading controls and principles,
which has undergone ongoing review by an independent assessor approved
by the FTC.
Question 18. Initial media reports stated that 50 million Facebook
users were impacted by the Cambridge Analytica incident, Facebook later
reported that 87 million users were impacted. How did Facebook arrive
at this number, and can we expect this number to rise?
Answer. Facebook users shared some data associated with
approximately 87 million users with Kogan's app, consisting of people
who installed the app and the friends of those users whose settings
permitted their data to be shared by their friends with apps. Facebook
does not know how many of these users actually had data shared by Kogan
with Cambridge Analytica, so this is a highly conservative estimate of
the maximum number of users who could have been impacted. Several
additional caveats apply to this figure:
First, this figure does not include users who installed the
app but have since deleted their Facebook account (since
Facebook no longer has that information).
Second, Facebook's counts of potentially affected friends of
installers of the app are likely substantially higher than the
``true'' number of affected friends, because (a) the counts
include any friend of any installer of the app during any time
between when the app first became active on the Platform in
November 2013 and when the app's access to friends data was
limited in May 2015, even though the friend may not have been a
friend when the app was actually installed by a relevant user;
(b) the counts include any friend of any installer even if they
changed their privacy settings during the relevant period to
disallow sharing with apps installed by their friends (due to
limited historical information about when or how users updated
their settings), such that some of their data may not have been
shared with the app; and (c) Facebook's counts include anyone
who installed the app during its existence on Facebook's
Platform, even if they installed the app at a time when its
access to user data, including data from friends of installers,
was more limited (due to limited historical information about
when individual users installed the app).
In addition, it is worth noting that the existing evidence that we
are able to access supports the conclusion that Kogan only provided SCL
with data on Facebook users from the United States. While the accounts
of Kogan and SCL conflict in some minor respects not relevant to this
question, both have consistently maintained that Kogan never provided
SCL with any data for Facebook users outside the United States. These
consistent statements are supported by a publicly released contract
between Kogan's company and SCL.
Question 19. Having discovered the improper data transfer to
Cambridge Analytica in 2015, why did Facebook wait until 2018 to
investigate or audit the data transfer to determine its full scope,
including the type of data improperly transferred?
Answer. Facebook obtained written certifications from Kogan, GSR,
and other third parties (including Cambridge Analytica and SCL)
declaring that all data they had obtained, and any derivatives, was
accounted for and destroyed. Based on recent allegations, we have
reopened our investigation into the veracity of these certifications
and have hired a forensic auditor to conduct a forensic audit of
Cambridge Analytica's systems. We are currently paused on the audit at
the request of the UK Information Commissioner's Office request, which
is conducting a regulatory investigation into Cambridge Analytica
(based in the UK), and we hope to move forward with that audit soon.
Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica from our service. We understand
that the company is now defunct.
Question 20. Mr. Zuckerberg, as you know, the Commerce Committee
has been seeking to find a bipartisan path forward on net neutrality
legislation. I believe bipartisan legislation is the best way to
protect net neutrality and stop the partisan back-and-forth at the
Federal Communications Commission over this issue. Will you commit to
working with Congress to develop a bipartisan legislative solution to
the issue of net neutrality?
Answer. Keeping the Internet open for everyone is crucial. Not only
does it promote innovation, but it lets people access information that
can change their lives and gives voice to those who might not otherwise
be heard. For these reasons, Facebook supports net neutrality and is
open to working with members of Congress and anyone else on a solution
that will preserve strong net neutrality protections.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Roger Wicker to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. Mr. Zuckerberg, during the hearing you confirmed that
Facebook collects the call and text histories of its users that use
Android phones. You also stated that Facebook only collects call and
text histories if a consumer opts-in to this Facebook service.
Does Facebook collect the call and text history information of
minors (13 to 17 years of age) that have Android phones and opt-in to
this service?
If yes, does Facebook require parental consent for minors to be
able to opt-in to this service?
How and in what manner does Facebook disclose to its users that it
is collecting the call and text history information of those that opt-
in to this service?
Answer. Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature
that lets people import contact information to help them connect with
people they know on Facebook and Messenger. We introduced the call and
text history component of this feature for Android users several years
ago, and currently offer it in Messenger and Facebook Lite, a
lightweight version of Facebook, on Android.
Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and serve as
a way to more easily find the people users want to connect with. They
help users find and stay connected with the people they care about and
provide them with a better experience across Facebook.
Before we receive call and text history from people, they
specifically grant us permission to access this data on their device
and separately agree to use the feature. If, at any time, they no
longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off, and all
previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted.
People can also access information they previously imported through the
Download Your Information tool.
We've reviewed this feature to confirm that Facebook does not
collect the content of messages--and will delete all logs older than
one year. In the future, people will only upload to our servers the
information needed to offer this feature--not broader data such as the
time of calls. We do allow people from 13 to 17 to opt into this
service. However, we do take other steps to protect teens on Facebook
and Messenger:
c
We provide education before allowing teens to post
publicly.
We don't show search results based on specific profile data
(high school, birthday/age, and hometown, or current city) of
teens to unconnected adults when the adults search on Facebook.
Unconnected adults can't message minors who are 13-17.
We have age limits for advertisements. For example, ads for
dating sites, financial services and other products or services
are gated to users under 18. We've also helped many teenagers
with information about bullying prevention campaigns and online
safety tips, including creating a new website full of privacy
and safety resources for teens: https://www.facebook.com/
safety/youth
Question 2. Is the data Facebook collects from call and text
histories of its users that have Android phones used for targeted
advertising purposes?
Answer. No, Facebook does not use SMS history to target interest-
based ads. Instead, call and text history logging is part of an opt-in
feature for people using Messenger or Facebook Lite on Android. This
helps Facebook users find and stay connected with the people they care
about and provides them with a better experience across Facebook. This
feature does not collect the content of users' calls or text messages.
Question 3. When a user uploads his or her contact list, Facebook
collects the phone numbers of the user's contacts. Please provide all
details regarding what Facebook does with the phone numbers of the
users' contacts, including with whom Facebook shares those numbers,
whether Facebook creates or updates profiles that associate these
numbers with people's names, and how long Facebook stores those
numbers.
Answer. Facebook allows people to upload, sync, and import their
contacts, typically using permissions that are enabled by major
operating systems like Apple's iOS and Google Android. When people use
the contact upload tool, they see prompts explaining what data will be
collected:
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
We use this information that people choose to share for a variety
of purposes, including to provide, personalize, and improve our
products; provide measurement, analytics, and other business services;
promote safety and security; to communicate with people who use our
services; and to research and innovate to promote the social good. We
provide more information in our Data Policy about these uses as well.
People can view and manage their contact uploads using our Contacts
Uploading tools, available at https://www.facebook.com/help/
355489824655936.
Question 4. There have been reports that Facebook can track a
user's internet-browsing activity even after the user has logged off of
the Facebook platform. Can you confirm whether or not this is true?
If yes, how does Facebook disclose to its users that it is engaging
in this type of tracking or data collection activity when a user has
logged off of the Facebook platform?
Answer. When people visit apps or websites that feature our
technologies--like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers
automatically log (i) standard browser or app records of the fact that
a particular device or user visited the website or app (this connection
to Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a
website or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button,
and is an inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any
additional information the publisher of the app or website chooses to
share with Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as
the fact that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard
feature of the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same
information with multiple different third-parties whenever people visit
their website or app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's
website shares information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick
and with the analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a
person visits the Committee's website, it sends browser information
about their visit to each one of those third parties. More information
about how this works is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/
04/data-off-facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for that
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us--
described above--in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First,
these logs are critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to
detecting or preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser
has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign
the device might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a
potentially inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to
register for an account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide
summaries and insights to websites and apps about how many people visit
or use their product, or use specific features like our Like button--
but without providing any information about a specific person. We do
not create profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use browser and
app logs for non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from our
advertisers to them or otherwise seek to personalize the content they
see. However, we may take the opportunity to show a general ad that is
unrelated to the attributes of the person or an ad encouraging the non-
user to sign up for Facebook.
When the individual is a Facebook user, we are also able to use
this information to personalize their experiences on Facebook, whether
or not they are logged out, but we will not target ads to users relying
on this information unless the user allows this in their privacy
settings. We do not sell or share this information with third-parties.
Question 5. Mr. Zuckerberg, if a user deletes his or her Facebook
account, does Facebook still track that person on non-Facebook websites
and applications?
Answer. Facebook does not create profiles or track website visits
for people without a Facebook account. See Response to Question 4.
Question 6. Mr. Zuckerberg, you asserted in the hearing that ``the
expectations that people have'' regarding use of data by ISPs are
somewhat different than for edge platforms like yours. In fact, a
survey by Peter D. Hart showed that 94 percent of consumers want their
online data to be subject to a consistent level of privacy protection
across the Internet and that ISPs and edge providers should be treated
alike. Do you have any consumer survey data or empirical evidence to
support your assertion that consumers expect or want different privacy
protections for ISPs? If so, please provide the consumer survey data or
empirical evidence that supports your assertion.
Answer. We believe that everyone should enjoy strong privacy
protections, but we also realize that people have different
expectations based on the context in which their information is
provided. For instance, a person who orders shoes from a mail-order
catalog would expect the retailer to know what is in the box that he is
being sent. But the customer would not expect the post office to know
what he or she has purchased just because it is delivering the box.
Because of this difference in expectations, the post office may need to
do more to inform people if it intends to inspect packages it delivers
and to give people control if it intends to use the information it
learns in other ways.
Consistent with this difference, experts have observed, ``The
context in which broadband customers share private information with
[Internet service] providers is specific and accompanied by cabined
expectations: the customers share the information with [Internet
service] providers to facilitate provision of a service for which they
have contracted. The information is therefore most appropriately
thought of as a loan to, rather than transferred to, broadband
providers.'' \1\ In contrast, a group of leading academic experts led
by Prof. Nick Feamster of Princeton University observed that people may
have access to only one or a few ISPs and simply expect those ISPs to
deliver their communications. Such a person has no choice about whether
to send his or her traffic over an ISP's network, whereas a ``user may
simply elect not to provide certain personal information or data to a
social network, or even to not use the social network at all.'' \2\
Other experts have observed that edge providers' collection of
information is generally more expected because it is related to the
services those companies provide.\3\

\3\ Paul R. Gaus, Only the Good Regulations Die Young: Recognizing
the Consumer Benefits of the FCC's Now-Defunct Privacy Regulations, 18
Minn. J. Law, Sci. & Tech. 713 (2017) (``Defining the Internet consumer
seems like a facile task, but it must incorporate how the person uses
digital devices to connect to the Internet and use content. In the
context of ISPs, the digital consumer conforms to a traditional
definition in that the consumer purchases ISP services to access the
internet. In the space of edge providers, the digital consumer engages
in traditional retail, watches content, interacts with others via
social media, and performs a plethora of other activities that provide
a telling summary about a person's life.'').
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In our own services, Facebook needs to have a different
understanding of a person's data than an ISP would. For instance, when
someone adds information to their profile or likes a Page on Facebook,
we must have access to that information in order to display it and use
it to personalize that person's experience. People would not
necessarily anticipate that other companies would have access to that
information, which is why we do not sell people's information to
advertisers and are increasing our efforts to guard against misuse of
people's Facebook information by third parties. It is also why we
provide people with the ability to turn off advertising based on the
apps and websites they use outside of our service, and we are investing
in enhanced transparency and control around this through our recent
announcement of a new tool, Clear History, that we are building.
Although we have not reviewed the detailed survey by Mr. Hart to
which the question refers, we understand that it focused on a different
question than Mr. Zuckerberg's testimony. Specifically, Mr. Hart's
survey asked people whether they believe that information should be
subject to protection; this is different from asking whether people
have different expectations about what information Facebook will
receive when they put information on their Facebook profile, as
compared to what information their Internet service provider will
receive when they take the same action.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Roy Blunt to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. Does Facebook collect user data through cross-device
tracking, and does this include off-line data (offline data defined as
that which is not directly contributed by a user through usage of
features of the Facebook app)?
Answer. Yes, Facebook's Data Policy specifically discloses that we
associate information across different devices that people use to
provide a consistent experience wherever they use Facebook.
Facebook's services inherently operate on a cross-device basis:
understanding when people use our services across multiple devices
helps us provide the same personalized experience wherever people use
Facebook--for example, to ensure that people's News Feeds or profiles
contains the same content whether they access our services on their
mobile phone or in a desktop computer's web browser.
In support of those and other purposes, we collect information from
and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected
devices our users use that integrate with our Products, and we combine
this information across a user's different devices. For example, we use
information collected about a person's use of our Products on their
phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or features
they see when they use our Products on another device, such as their
laptop or tablet, or to measure whether they took an action in response
to an ad we showed them on their phone or on a different device.
Information we obtain from these devices includes:
Device attributes: information such as the operating system,
hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength,
available storage space, browser type, app and file names and
types, and plugins.
Device operations: information about operations and
behaviors performed on the device, such as whether a window is
foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can
help distinguish humans from bots).
Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other
identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts people use,
and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to Facebook
Company Products associated with the same device or account).
Device signals: Bluetooth signals, and information about
nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers.
Data from device settings: information a user allows us to
receive through device settings they turn on, such as access to
their GPS location, camera, or photos.
Network and connections: information such as the name of a
user's mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile
phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases,
information about other devices that are nearby or on their
network, so we can do things like help them stream a video from
their phone to their TV.
Cookie data: data from cookies stored on a user's device,
including cookie IDs and settings. More information is
available at https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/ and
https://help.instagram.com/1896641480634370?ref=ig.
Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information
through Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins
(such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the
Facebook pixel. These partners provide information about a person's
activities off Facebook--including information about their device,
websites they visit, purchases they make, the ads they see, and how
they use their services--whether or not they have a Facebook account or
are logged into Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our
API to tell us what games a person plays, or a business could tell us
about a purchase a person made in its store. We also receive
information about a person's online and offline actions and purchases
from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide us with
that person's information.
We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including
to personalize features and content (including a person's News Feed,
Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories, and ads) and make suggestions for a
user (such as groups or events they may be interested in or topics they
may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized
Products that are unique and relevant to them, we use their
connections, preferences, interests and activities based on the data we
collect and learn from them and others (including any data with special
protections they choose to provide); how they use and interact with our
Products; and the people, places, or things they're connected to and
interested in on and off our Products.
For example, if people have shared their device locations with
Facebook or checked into a specific restaurant, we can show them ads
from an advertiser that wants to promote its services in their area or
from the restaurant. We use location-related information-such as a
person's current location, where they live, the places they like to go,
and the businesses and people they're near-to provide, personalize and
improve our Products, including ads, for them and others. Location-
related information can be based on things like precise device location
(if a user has allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information
from their and others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or
events they attend). We store data until it is no longer necessary to
provide our services and Facebook Products, or until a person's account
is deleted--whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination
that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected
and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. We
provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their
ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information
that personally identifies someone (information such as a person's name
or e-mail address that by itself can be used to contact them or
identifies who they are) unless they give us permission. For example,
we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers
(for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and
34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them
better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads
led users to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.
Question 2. Cross-device data collection allows for data and user
profile meshing that the average users are likely not cognizant of.
Last year, the Federal Trade Commission flagged cross-device tracking
as a possible concern, due to the fact that most companies do not
explicitly discuss cross-device tracking in their privacy policies.
Does Facebook disclose its collection methods across each applicable
device, and if so, do you offer your users choices about how cross-
device activity is tracked?
Answer. See Response to Question 1.
Question 3. Are users required to resubmit their permissions for
each separate device that utilizes the Facebook app, or are user
permissions blanketed across devices?
Answer. Mobile operating systems like Google's Android and Apple's
iOS have device-specific access controls implemented at the operating
system level.
Question 4. Facebook has been criticized for previous versions of
its mobile application on Android devices, and the manner in which
permissions were bundled without the ability to grant or deny each
permission individually. I understand that Facebook and Android have
updated their platforms, allowing more latitude for users to review
permissions individually. What is the technical and commercial purpose
of bundling permissions?
Answer. Android and other operating systems (like Apple's iOS)
control the way device permissions work. Facebook can't, for example,
request permissions in a way that's not permitted on an Android device.
Accordingly, where permitted by the operating system, we generally ask
for permission in-context--for example, requesting access to a device's
camera roll when someone uses a feature that requires it. But for other
permissions, on the Android operating system, we must list all of the
permissions that various features might require at the point when a
person installs the app, even if we do not intend to use those
permissions until those features are accessed.
On our website, we explain more about permissions that we request
and provide examples of how they are used. You can find this
information at https://www
.facebook.com/help/210676372433246.
Question 5. How does your company prioritize transparency and
choice for users in the way that it collects and aggregates user data?
Answer. Our approach to transparency is threefold.
First, we provide information about the data we collect and use and
how people can control it in context as people use Facebook. Research
overwhelmingly demonstrates that in-product controls and education are
the most meaningful to people and the most likely to be read and
understood.
Second, we provide information about how we collect and use data in
our user agreements and related educational materials. These materials
include our Data Policy, which we updated recently to make it more
detailed and easier to understand, and Privacy Basics, a series of
short, interactive guides that answer some of the most common questions
we receive about privacy.
Third, we enable people to learn more about the data we collect
through interactive tools such as Download Your Information, which lets
people download a file containing data that they may want to take to
another service, and Access Your Information, a tool we've launched for
people to more easily access and manage their data on Facebook.
Our approach to control is based on the belief that people should
be able to choose who can see what they share and how their data shapes
their experience on Facebook and should have control over all data
collection and uses that are not necessary to provide and secure our
service. People can control the audience for their posts and the apps
that can receive their data. They can control the people, Pages,
Groups, and Events they connect to, and how they see content from those
connections in their News Feeds. They can provide feedback on every
post they see on Facebook--feedback, for example, that they want to see
less of a particular kind of post or fewer posts from a particular
person or Page. They can see and delete the history of their activities
on Facebook, and, if they no longer want to use Facebook, they can
delete their account and the data associated with it.
We recognize, however, that controls are only useful if people know
how to find and use them. That is why we continuously deliver in-
product educational videos in people's News Feeds on important privacy
topics like how to review and delete old posts and what it means to
delete an account. We are also inviting people to take our Privacy
Checkup--which prompts people to review key data controls--and we are
sharing privacy tips in education campaigns off of Facebook, including
through ads on other websites. To make our privacy controls easier to
find, we are launching a new settings menu that features core privacy
settings in a single place.

II. Questions
Question 1. Please attach a copy of each and every formal or
informal policy, whether presently written or otherwise, regarding the
moderation, promotion, evaluation, or alteration of users or content on
Facebook. These include, for example, Facebook's Terms of Service, its
Community Guidelines, and similar policies.
Answer. Facebook's Terms and Policies are available here: https://
www.facebook
.com/policies. Facebook's Community Standards are available at https://
www
.facebook.com/communitystandards/.
Question 2. Yes or no: Are Facebook's decisions to permit users
access to its services or to permit content to remain displayed on its
services, or the prominence or accessibility of that content, including
its order, visibility, duration visible, inclusion in searches or order
within search results, inclusion within ``Trending'' lists or analogous
suggestions of content to users, determined in whole or part by
Facebook's corporate values, beliefs, priorities, or opinions?
(a) Yes or no: Does Facebook promote, demote, or block users or
content based on its assessment of the social value or social
desirability of that content?
(b) Yes or no: Does Facebook promote, demote, or block users or
content based on its assessment of that content's truth or falsity?
(c) Yes or no: Does Facebook promote, demote, or block users or
content based on its assessment of the content's agreement or
disagreement with Facebook's corporate values, beliefs, priorities, or
opinions?
Answer. The conversations that happen on Facebook reflect the
diversity and free expression of a community of more than two billion
people communicating across countries and cultures and in dozens of
languages, posting everything from text to photos and videos.
With regard the order and visibility of content, a user's News Feed
is made up of stories from their friends, Pages they've chosen to
follow and groups they've joined. Ranking is the process we use to
organize all of those stories so that users can see the most relevant
content at the top, every time they open Facebook. Ranking has four
elements: the available inventory of stories; the signals, or data
points that can inform ranking decisions; the predictions we make,
including how likely we think they are to comment on a story, share
with a friend, etc.; and a relevancy score for each story.
Misleading or harmful content on Facebook comes in many different
forms, from annoyances like clickbait to hate speech and violent
content. When we detect this kind of content in News Feed, there are
three types of actions we take: remove it, reduce its spread, or inform
people with additional context.
Our Community Standards and Ads Policies outline the content that
is not allowed on the platform, such as hate speech, fake accounts, and
praise, support, or representation of terrorism/terrorists. When we
find things that violate these standards, we remove them. There are
other types of problematic content that, although they don't violate
our policies, are still misleading or harmful and that our community
has told us they don't want to see on Facebook--things like clickbait
or sensationalism. When we find examples of this kind of content, we
reduce its spread in News Feed using ranking and, increasingly, we
inform users with additional context so they can decide whether to
read, trust, or share it.
The goal of our Community Standards is to encourage expression and
create a safe environment. We base our policies on input from our
community and from experts in fields such as technology and public
safety. Our policies are also rooted in the following principles:
(1) Safety: People need to feel safe in order to build
community. We are committed to removing content that encourages
real-world harm, including (but not limited to) physical,
financial, and emotional injury.
(2) Voice: Our mission is all about embracing diverse views. We
err on the side of allowing content, even when some find it
objectionable, unless removing that content can prevent a
specific harm. Moreover, at times we will allow content that
might otherwise violate our standards if we feel that it is
newsworthy, significant, or important to the public interest.
We do this only after weighing the public interest value of the
content against the risk of real-world harm; and
(3) Equity: Our community is global and diverse. Our policies
may seem broad, but that is because we apply them consistently
and fairly to a community that transcends regions, cultures,
and languages. As a result, our Community Standards can
sometimes appear less nuanced than we would like, leading to an
outcome that is at odds with their underlying purpose. For that
reason, in some cases, and when we are provided with additional
context, we make a decision based on the spirit, rather than
the letter, of the policy.
Question 3. Yes or no: Have Facebook's decisions to permit users
access to its services or to permit content to remain displayed on its
services, or the prominence or accessibility of that content, including
its order, visibility, duration visible, inclusion in searches or order
within search results, inclusion within ``Trending'' lists or analogous
suggestions of content to users, ever been determined in whole or part
by Facebook's corporate values, beliefs, priorities, or opinions?
Answer. See Response to Question 2.
(a) Yes or no: Has Facebook ever promoted, demoted, or blocked
users or content based on its assessment of the social value or social
desirability of that content?
Answer. See Response to Question 2.
(b) Yes or no: Has Facebook ever promoted, demoted, or blocked
users or content based on its assessment of that content's truth or
falsity?
Answer. See Response to Question 2.
(c) Yes or no: Has Facebook ever promoted, demoted, or blocked
users or content based on its assessment of the content's agreement or
disagreement with Facebook's corporate values, beliefs, priorities, or
opinions?
Answer. See Response to Question 2.
Question 4. Yes or no: Does Facebook employ its corporate values,
beliefs, priorities, or opinions when deciding what content Facebook
removes, republishes, moderates, promotes, or otherwise increases or
decreases access to content?
Answer. The conversations that happen on Facebook reflect the
diversity of a community of more than two billion people communicating
across countries and cultures and in dozens of languages, posting
everything from text to photos and videos.
We recognize how important it is for Facebook to be a place where
people feel empowered to communicate, and we take our role in keeping
abuse off our service seriously. That's why we have developed a set of
Community Standards that outline what is and is not allowed on
Facebook. Our Standards apply around the world to all types of content.
They're designed to be comprehensive--for example, content that might
not be considered hate speech may still be removed for violating our
bullying policies.
The goal of our Community Standards is to encourage expression and
create a safe environment. We base our policies on input from our
community and from experts in fields such as technology and public
safety. Our policies are also rooted in the following principles:
(1) Safety: People need to feel safe in order to build
community. We are committed to removing content that encourages
real-world harm, including (but not limited to) physical,
financial, and emotional injury.
(2) Voice: Our mission is all about embracing diverse views. We
err on the side of allowing content, even when some find it

outcome that is at odds with their underlying purpose. For that
reason, in some cases, and when we are provided with additional
context, we make a decision based on the spirit, rather than
the letter, of the policy.
Question 5. Yes or no: Has Facebook ever employed its corporate
values, beliefs, priorities, or opinions when deciding what content
Facebook removes, republishes, moderates, promotes, or otherwise
increases or decreases access to content?
Answer. See Response to Question 4.
Question 6. It has become a common position on colleges and
universities that statements which a listener disagrees with severely
either can constitute violence or can rise to the moral equivalent of
violence. According to this position, statements may rise to the level
of violence even without a threat, reasonable or otherwise, of imminent
violence, the use of ``fighting words,'' or either a subjective intent
or reasonably understood objective attempt to harass a listener.
(a) Yes or no: Does Facebook believe that speech neither advocating
for physical violence against, threatening physical violence against,
nor undertaken with either the subjective purpose or objective indicia
of harassing a listener, may constitute violence?
Answer. Freedom of expression is one of our core values, and we
believe that adding voices to the conversation creates a richer and
more vibrant community. We want people to feel confident that our
community welcomes all viewpoints and we are committed to designing our
products to give all people a voice and foster the free flow of ideas
and culture.
On the subject of credible violence, our Community Standards are
explicit in what we don't allow. We aim to prevent potential real-world
harm that may be related to content on Facebook. We understand that
people commonly express disdain or disagreement by threatening or
calling for violence in facetious and non-serious ways. That's why we
try to consider the language, context and details in order to
distinguish casual statements from content that constitutes a credible
threat to public or personal safety. In determining whether a threat is
credible, we may also consider additional information like a targeted
person's public visibility and vulnerability. We remove content,
disable accounts, and work with law enforcement when we believe there
is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public safety.
(b) Yes or no: Has Facebook ever believed that speech neither
advocating for physical violence against, threatening physical violence
against, nor undertaken with either the subjective purpose or objective
indicia of harassing a listener, may constitute violence?
Answer. See Response to Question 6(a).
Question 7. Regardless of Facebook's answer to Question 7, have any
of Facebook's policies ever required removal of content not described
in Question 7 from Facebook? If so, what categories, and based on what
policies?
Answer. The goal of our Community Standards is to encourage
expression and create a safe environment. We base our policies on input
from our community and from experts in fields such as technology and
public safety. Our policies are also rooted in the following
principles:
(1) Safety: People need to feel safe in order to build
community. We are committed to removing content that encourages
real-world harm, including (but not limited to) physical,
financial, and emotional injury.
(2) Voice: Our mission is all about embracing diverse views. We
err on the side of allowing content, even when some find it
objectionable, unless removing that content can prevent a
specific harm. Moreover, at times we will allow content that
might otherwise violate our standards if we feel that it is
newsworthy, significant, or important to the public interest.
We do this only after weighing the public interest value of the
content against the risk of real-world harm; and
(3) Equity: Our community is global and diverse. Our policies
may seem broad, but that is because we apply them consistently
and fairly to a community that transcends regions, cultures,
and languages. As a result, our Community Standards can
sometimes appear less nuanced than we would like, leading to an
outcome that is at odds with their underlying purpose. For that
reason, in some cases, and when we are provided with additional
context, we make a decision based on the spirit, rather than
the letter, of the policy.
Question 8. Yes or no: Does Facebook consider itself a publisher or
speaker entitled to First Amendment protection when supervising its
services, designing or implementing its policies, altering, reposting,
promoting or demoting content, including through results displayed by a
user search, their order or presence in a ``Trending'' list or similar
suggestions to users regarding content?
Answer. Facebook does not create the content that users share on
its Platform, although it does take steps to arrange, rank and
distribute that content to those who are most likely to be interested
in it, or to remove objectionable content from its service. These
activities are protected functions under Communications Decency Act
Section 230 and the First Amendment.
Question 9. Aside from content clearly marked as coming from
Facebook or one of its officers or employees, under what circumstances
does Facebook consider itself as acting as a First-Amendment-protected
publisher or speaker in its moderation, maintenance, or supervision
over its users or their content?
Answer. We are, first and foremost, a technology company. Facebook
does not create or edit the content that users publish on our platform.
While we seek to be a platform for a broad range of ideas, we do
moderate content according to published community standards in order to
keep users on the platform safe, to reduce objectionable content and to
make sure users participate on the platform responsibly.
Question 10. Yes or no: Does Facebook provide access to its
services on a viewpoint-neutral basis? For this question and its
subparts, please construe ``access to its services'' and similar
phrases broadly, including the position or order in which content is
displayed on its services, the position or order in which users or
content show up in searches (or whether they show up at all), whether
users or content are permitted to purchase advertisements (or be
advertised), the rates charged for those advertisements, and so on.
Answer. We are committed to free expression and err on the side of
allowing content. When we make a mistake, we work to make it right. And
we are committed to constantly improving our efforts so we make as few
mistakes as humanly possible.
Decisions about whether to remove content are based on whether the
content violates our Community Standards.
Discussing controversial topics or espousing a debated point of
view is not at odds with our Community Standards, the policies that
outline what is and isn't allowed on Facebook. We believe that such
discussion is important in helping bridge division and promote greater
understanding.
We are committed to designing our products to give all people a
voice and foster the free flow of ideas and culture. That said, when
something crosses the line into hate speech, it has no place on
Facebook, and we are committed to removing it from our platform any
time we become aware of it.
We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we
call protected characteristics--race, ethnicity, national origin,
religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender
identity, and serious disability or disease. We also provide some
protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or
dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion
or segregation. The detailed guidelines our reviewers use to assess
whether content violates our hate speech policies are available here:
https://www.facebook.com/communitystan
dards/objectionable_content/hate_speech.
(a) Yes or no: Has Facebook ever discriminated among users on the
basis of viewpoint when determining whether to permit a user to access
its services? If so, please list each instance in which Facebook has
done so.
Answer. See Response to Question 10.
(i) If so, does Facebook continue to do so today, or when did
Facebook stop doing so?
Answer. See Response to Question 10.
(ii) If so, what viewpoint(s) has Facebook discriminated against or
in favor of? In what way(s) has Facebook done so?
Answer. See Response to Question 10.
(iii) If so, does Facebook act only on viewpoints expressed on
Facebook, or does it discriminate among users based on viewpoints
expressed elsewhere? Has Facebook ever based its decision to permit or
deny a user access to its services on viewpoints expressed off
Facebook?
Answer. See Response to Question 10.
(b) Yes or no: Excluding content encouraging physical self-harm,
threats of physical violence, terrorism, and other content relating to
the credible and imminent physical harm of specific individuals, has
Facebook ever discriminated among content on the basis of viewpoint in
its services? If so, please list each instance in which Facebook has
done so.
Answer. See Response to Question 10.
(c) Yes or no: Has Facebook ever discriminated against American
users or content on the basis of an affiliation with a religion or
political party? If so, please list each instance in which Facebook has
done so and describe the group or affiliation against which (or in
favor of which) Facebook was discriminating.
Answer. See Response to Question 10.
(d) Yes or no: Has Facebook ever discriminated against any American
users or content on its services on the basis of partisan affiliation
with the Republican or Democratic parties? This question includes
advocacy for or against a party or specific candidate or official. If
so, please list each instance and the party affiliation discriminated
against.
Answer. See Response to Question 10.
(e) Yes or no: Has Facebook ever discriminated against any American
users or content on its services on the basis of the user's or
content's advocacy for a political position on any issue in local,
State, or national politics? This question includes but is not limited
to advocacy for or against abortion, gun control, consumption of
marijuana, and net neutrality.
Answer. See Response to Question 10.
(f) Yes or no: Has Facebook ever discriminated against any American
users or content on its services on the basis of the user's or
content's religion, including advocacy for one or more tenets of that
religion? If so, please list each such instance in which Facebook has
done so and identify the religion, religious group, or tenet against
which Facebook discriminated.
Answer. See Response to Question 10.
Question 11. Yes or no: Has Facebook ever discriminated between
users in how their content is published, viewed, received, displayed in
``trending'' or similar lists, or otherwise in any function or feature,
based on the user's political affinity, religion, religious tenets,
ideological positions, or any ideological or philosophical position
asserted? If so, please list each such incident as well as the basis on
which Facebook discriminated against that user or content.
Answer. Being a platform for all ideas is a foundational principle
of Facebook. We are committed to ensuring there is no bias in the work
we do.
Suppressing content on the basis of political viewpoint or
preventing people from seeing what matters most to them is directly
contrary to Facebook's mission and our business objectives.
When allegations of political bias surfaced in relation to
Facebook's Trending Topics feature, we immediately launched an
investigation to determine if anyone violated the integrity of the
feature or acted in ways that are inconsistent with Facebook's policies
and mission. We spoke with current reviewers and their supervisors, as
well as a cross-section of former reviewers; spoke with our contractor;
reviewed our guidelines, training, and practices; examined the
effectiveness of operational oversight designed to identify and correct
mistakes and abuse; and analyzed data on the implementation of our
guidelines by reviewers.
Ultimately, our investigation revealed no evidence of systematic
political bias in the selection or prominence of stories included in
the Trending Topics feature. In fact, our analysis indicated that the
rates of approval of conservative and liberal topics are virtually
identical in Trending Topics. Moreover, we were unable to substantiate
any of the specific allegations of politically-motivated suppression of
subjects or sources, as reported in the media. To the contrary, we
confirmed that most of those subjects were in fact included as trending
topics on multiple occasions, on dates and at intervals that would be
expected given the volume of discussion around those topics on those
dates.
Nonetheless, as part of our commitment to continually improve our
products and to minimize risks where human judgment is involved, we are
making a number of changes:
We have engaged an outside advisor, former Senator Jon Kyl, to
advise the company on potential bias against conservative
voices. We believe this external feedback will help us improve
over time and ensure we can most effectively serve our diverse
community and build trust in Facebook as a platform for all
ideas.
We continue to expand our list of outside partner organizations
to ensure we receive feedback on our content policies from a
diverse set of viewpoints.
We have made our detailed reviewer guidelines public to help
people understand how and why we make decisions about the
content that is and is not allowed on Facebook.
We have launched an appeals process to enable people to contest
content decisions with which they disagree.
We are instituting additional controls and oversight around the
review team, including robust escalation procedures and updated
reviewer training materials.
These improvements and safeguards are designed to ensure that
Facebook remains a platform for all ideas and enables the broadest
spectrum of free expression possible.

Answer. When content that violates our policies is brought to our
attention, we remove that content--regardless of who posted it. We have
removed content posted by individuals and entities across the political
spectrum.
On April 24, 2018, we published the detailed guidelines our
reviewers use to make decisions about reported content on Facebook.
These guidelines cover everything from nudity to graphic violence.
We published these guidelines because we believe that increased
transparency will provide more clarity on where we draw lines on
complex and continuously evolving issues, and we hope that sharing
these details will prompt an open and honest dialogue about our
decision making process that will help us improve--both in how we
develop and enforce our standards. We recognize that our policies are
only as good as the strength and accuracy of our enforcement--and our
enforcement is not perfect. We make mistakes because our processes
involve people, and people are not infallible. We are always working to
improve.
We do not typically comment on specific cases of content removal
for privacy reasons.
Question 13. In your testimony before the committees, you stated
several times that Facebook prohibits content based on its status as
``hate speech.'' How have you and Facebook defined ``hate speech''
today and at any other stage in Facebook's existence?
Answer. We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on
what we call protected characteristics--race, ethnicity, national
origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender
identity, and serious disability or disease. We also provide some
protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or
dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion
or segregation. The detailed guidelines our reviewers use to assess
whether content violates our hate speech policies are available here:
https://www.facebook.com/com
munitystandards/objectionable_content/hate_speech.
Our Community Standards make an important distinction between
targeting people and targeting particular beliefs or institutions. We
believe that people should be able to share their views and discuss
controversial ideas on Facebook.
Question 14. Did or does Facebook collaborate with or defer to any
outside individuals or organizations in determining whether to classify
a particular statement as ``hate speech?'' If so, please list the
individuals and organizations.
Answer. Hate speech has no place on our platform. Our Community
Standards prohibit attacks based on characteristics including race,
ethnicity, religion, and national origin.
Facebook has partnerships with academics and experts who study
organized hate groups and hate speech. These academics and experts
share information with Facebook as to how organizations are adapting to
social media and give feedback on how Facebook might better tackle
these problems. We recently hosted several of these academics at
Facebook for multiple days of observation and assessment, during which
the academics attended substantive meetings on our content policies and
the guidance we provide to our reviewers. Further, in the area of hate
speech, there are very important academic projects that we follow
closely. Timothy Garton Ash, for example, has created the Free Speech
Debate to look at these issues on a cross-cultural basis. Susan Benesch
established the Dangerous Speech Project, which investigates the
connection between speech and violence. These projects show how much
work is left to be done in defining the boundaries of speech online,
which is why we will keep participating in this work to help inform our
policies at Facebook. We are committed to continuing our dialogue with
third parties to ensure we can have the widest possible expression of
ideas, while preventing abuse of the platform.
Facebook works with organizations from across the political
spectrum around changes to our content standards including hate speech.
While we do not share individual pieces of content from users with
these organizations out of concerns for user privacy, we do provide in-
depth examples and explanations of what the policy changes would
entail.
Question 15. Did or does Facebook collaborate with or defer to any
outside individuals or organizations in determining whether a given
speaker has committed acts of ``hate speech'' in the past? If so,
please list the individuals and organizations.
Answer. In an effort to prevent and disrupt real-world harm, we do
not allow any organizations or individuals that are engaged in
organized hate to have a presence on Facebook. We also remove content
that expresses support or praise for groups, leaders, or individuals
involved in these activities.
In developing and iterating on our policies, including our policy
specific to hate speech, we consult with outside academics and experts
from across the political spectrum and around the world. We do not,
however, defer to these individuals or organizations in making
decisions about content on our platform. Content that violates our
Community Standards is removed when we are made aware of it, and
content that doesn't violate is left on the platform.
Designating hate organizations and/or individuals is an extensive
process that takes into account a number of different signals. We
worked with academics and NGOs to establish this process and regularly
engage with them to understand whether we should refine it. Among the
signals we consider are whether the individual or organization in
question has called for or directly carried out violence against people
based on protected characteristics.
Question 16. Did or does Facebook ban or otherwise limit the
content of individuals or organizations who have spoken ``hate speech''
on its platform aside from the offending content? If so, under what
circumstances?
Answer. See Response to Question 15.
Question 17. Yes or no: Did or does Facebook ban or otherwise limit
the content of individuals or organizations on its platform based on
hate speech or other behavior conducted outside of Facebook's platform?
Answer. See Response to Question 15.
Question 18. Yes or no: Do you believe that ``hate speech'' is not
protected under the First Amendment from government censorship?
Answer. The goal of our Community Standards is to encourage
expression and create a safe community for our 2 billion users, more
than 87 percent of whom are located outside the United States.
We err on the side of allowing content, even when some find it
objectionable, unless removing that content prevents a specific harm.
We do not allow hate speech on Facebook because it creates an
environment of intimidation and exclusion and in some cases may promote
real-world violence.
Our current definition of hate speech is anything that directly
attacks people based on what are known as their ``protected
characteristics''--race, ethnicity, national origin, religious
affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender identity, or
serious disability or disease. However, our definition does allow for
discussion around these characteristics as concepts in an effort to
allow for and encourage expression and dialogue by our users.
There is no universally accepted answer for when something crosses
the line.
Our approach to hate speech, like those of other platforms, has
evolved over time and continues to change as we learn from our
community, from experts in the field, and as technology provides us new
tools to operate more quickly, more accurately and precisely at scale.
Question 19. Yes or no: Have you ever believed that ``hate speech''
is not protected under the First Amendment from government censorship?
Answer. See Response to Question 18.
Question 20. Yes or no: Does Facebook believe that ``hate speech''
is not protected under the First Amendment from government censorship?
Answer. See Response to Question 18.
Question 21. Yes or no: Has Facebook ever believed that ``hate
speech'' is not protected under the First Amendment from government
censorship?
Answer. See Response to Question 18.
Question 22. Yes or no: Does Facebook's ``hate speech'' policy
prohibit, exclude, remove, or censor content that, were Facebook a
governmental entity, would be entitled to First Amendment protections?
Answer. See Response to Question 18.
Question 23. Facebook states on its website that, per its community
standards, Facebook will remove hate speech, which it describes as
``including content that directly attacks people based on their: race,
ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation,
sex, gender, or gender identity, or serious disabilities or diseases.''
Yes or no: Does Facebook limit its definition of hate speech only to
content that ``directly attacks'' people based on the aforementioned
characteristics?
Answer. We define ``attack'' under our hate speech policy as
violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls
for exclusion or segregation. We allow discussion of issues related to
characteristics like race, gender, ethnicity, and immigration status.
We do not permit attacks against people based on these characteristics.
Context matters in making what can be a difficult determination in some
cases.
Specific details on the type of content that is prohibited under
our hate speech policies are available here: https://www.facebook.com/
communitystandards/objec
tionable_content/hate_speech.
Question 24. What standard or procedure has Facebook applied now
and in the past in determining whether content ``directly attacks'' an
individual or group based on a protected characteristic under
Facebook's community standards?
Answer. See Response to Question 23.
Question 25. Yes or no: Has Facebook ever removed content for hate
speech that did not directly attack a person on the basis of his or her
race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual
orientation, sex, gender, or gender identity, or serious disabilities
or diseases? If so, what criteria did Facebook use to determine that
the content violated Facebook's policy?
Answer. We define ``attack'' under our hate speech policy as
violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls
for exclusion or segregation.
Sometimes, it's obvious that something is hate speech and should be
removed--because it includes the direct incitement of violence against
people possessing protected characteristics, or degrades or dehumanizes
people. Sometimes, however, there isn't a clear consensus--because the
words themselves are ambiguous, the intent behind them is unknown, or
the context around them is unclear. Language also continues to evolve,
and a word that was not a slur yesterday may become one today.
Here are some of the things we take into consideration when
deciding what to leave on the site and what to remove.
Context: Regional and linguistic context is often critical
in deciding whether content constitutes hate speech, as is the
need to take geopolitical events into account. In Myanmar, for
example, the word ``kalar'' has benign historic roots, and is
still used innocuously across many related Burmese words. The
term can however also be used as an inflammatory slur,
including as an attack by Buddhist nationalists against
Muslims. We looked at the way the word's use was evolving, and
decided our policy should be to remove it as hate speech when
used to attack a person or group, but not in the other harmless
use cases.
Intent: There are times someone might share something that
would otherwise be considered hate speech but for non-hateful
reasons, such as making a self-deprecating joke or quoting
lyrics from a song. People often use satire and comedy to make
a point about hate speech. In other cases, people may speak out
against hatred by condemning someone else's use of offensive
language, which requires repeating the original offense. This
is something we allow, even though it might seem questionable
since it means some people may encounter material disturbing to
them. But it also gives our community the chance to speak out
against hateful ideas. We revised our Community Standards to
encourage people to make it clear when they're sharing
something to condemn it, but sometimes their intent isn't
clear, and anti-hatred posts get removed in error.
On April 24, 2018, we announced the launch of appeals for content
that was removed for hate speech. We recognize that we make enforcement
errors on both sides of the equation--what to allow, and what to
remove--and that our mistakes cause a great deal of concern for people,
which is why we need to allow the option to request review of the
decision and provide additional context that will help our team see the
fuller picture as they review the post again. This type of feedback
will allow us to continue improving our systems and processes so we can
prevent similar mistakes in the future.
Question 26. Has Facebook ever removed content for hate speech that
was posted by an individual employed by Facebook? If so, please
describe each instance.
Answer. Our policies apply equally to all of our users. If a
Facebook employee posted content that was reported to us and violated
our policies, the content would be removed.
Question 27. Recording artist Taylor Swift recently released a
cover of Earth, Wind & Fire's ``September.''
(a) In response, Nathaniel Friedman, an author at GQ magazine,
stated that ``Taylor Swift's cover of `September' is hate speech.''
Does Facebook agree?
(b) In response, Monique Judge, an author at The Root, stated that
``Taylor Swift needs her *** whooped.'' Is this statement hate speech?
Answer. We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on
what we call protected characteristics--race, ethnicity, national
origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender
identity, and serious disability or disease. We also provide some
protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or
dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion
or segregation. Our detailed hate speech policies are available at
https://www.facebook.com/
communitystandards/objectionable_content/hate_speech.
We generally do not assess whether content violates our policies
(including our hate speech policy) unless it is part of our normal
content review process. Context matters in making what can be a
difficult determination in some cases. Sometimes, it's obvious that
something is hate speech and should be removed--because it includes the
direct incitement of violence against people possessing protected
characteristics, or degrades or dehumanizes people. Sometimes, however,
there isn't a clear consensus--because the words themselves are
ambiguous, the intent behind them is unknown or the context around them
is unclear. Language also continues to evolve, and a word that was not
a slur yesterday may become one today.
Question 28. It was reported that Democratic D.C. Councilman Trayon
White posted a video on his Facebook page blaming a recent snowstorm on
wealthy Jewish families. According to USA Today, White said: ``It just
started snowing out of nowhere this morning, man. Y'all better pay
attention to this climate control, man, this climate manipulation,''
which White attributed to ``the Rothschilds controlling the climate to
create natural disasters they can pay for to own the cities, man.''
(a) Yes or no: Does Facebook consider this video or this quote hate
speech?
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
(b) Yes or no: Did Facebook remove this video from its platform? If
so, when? If not, why not?
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
Question 29. Multiple authors for the website Vox, including its
founder, Ezra Klein, have described Charles Murray's book, The Bell
Curve, as ``hate speech.'' Similarly, the left-wing Southern Poverty
Law Center perplexingly describes Murray as a ``white nationalist,''
largely relying on its depiction of The Bell Curve.
(a) Does The Bell Curve qualify as ``hate speech'' for purposes of
Facebook's policies?
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
(i) If so, what portions of The Bell Curve qualify as ``hate
speech?'' Please provide quotations with page numbers for these
portions.
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
(ii) If not, do Facebook's content policies prohibit a false claim
that someone has engaged in ``hate speech?''
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
(iii) What procedures or penalties does Facebook employ, if any, to
discourage false claims that someone has engaged in hate speech?
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
Question 30. Are any portions of the Bible, quoted verbatim and
with citation, subject to removal as:
(a) ``Hate speech?'' If so, please list the quotations and under
which translation Facebook considers the quote ``hate speech.''
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
(b) Harassment? If so, please list the quotations and under which
translation Facebook considers the quote harassment.
Answer. We do not tolerate harassment on Facebook because we want
people to feel safe to engage and connect with their community. Our
harassment policy applies to both public and private individuals and
includes behavior like repeatedly contacting a single user despite that
person's clear desire and action to prevent that contact and repeatedly
contacting large numbers of people with no prior solicitation. It also
applies to calls for death, serious disease or disability, or physical
harm aimed at an individual or group of individuals in a message
thread. Context and intent matter, however, and we allow people to
share and re-share posts if it is clear that something was shared in
order to condemn or draw attention to harassment. The detailed
guidelines our reviewers use to assess whether content violates our
hate speech policies are available at https://www.facebook.com/
communitystan
dards/safety/harassment.
We released our updated Community Standards--which reflect the
guidelines our reviewers use to evaluate content that is reported to
us--in order to better demonstrate where we draw lines on complex and
continuously evolving issues. We also simultaneously launched an
appeals process for content that has been removed for nudity/sexual
activity, hate speech, and graphic violence. With this launch, we are
giving people an opportunity to request review of our decisions and
provide additional context that will help our team see a more complete
picture as they review the post again. This type of feedback allows us
to continue improving our systems and processes so we can prevent
similar mistakes in the future.
Question 31. On April 19, 2018, the California State Assembly voted
in favor of a bill, AB 2943, which would make it an ``unlawful business
practice'' to engage in any transaction for a good or service that
seeks ``to change an individual's sexual orientation'' The bill
clarifies that this includes efforts to ``change behaviors or gender
expressions, or to eliminate or reduce sexual or romantic attractions
or feelings toward individuals of the same sex.'' Multiple legal
experts have observed that the bill's language, reasonably interpreted,
could be read to outlaw the sale and purchase of books, such as the
Bible, the Torah, and the Koran, which advocate for traditional sexual
ethics.
(a) Yes or no: Does Facebook believe that books, such as the Bible,
the Torah, and the Koran, which advocate for traditional sexual ethics,
constitute hate speech?
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
(b) Yes or no: Does Facebook consider any part of the Bible, the
Torah, and/or the Koran hate speech? If so, what parts of the Bible,
the Torah, and/or the Koran qualify? Please provide quotations with
page numbers for each part identified as hate speech.
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
(c) Yes or no: Does Facebook believe that the messages contained in
books, such as the Bible, the Torah, and the Koran, which advocate for
traditional sexual ethics (i.e. that sex should be had only within a
marriage between one man and one woman), should be discouraged from
public dissemination?
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
(d) Yes or no: Does Facebook agree with the California State
Assembly that goods or services that seek to change behaviors or gender
expressions deserve to be discouraged, muted, or banned?
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
(e) Yes or no: Does Facebook agree with the California State
Assembly that goods or services that seek to eliminate or reduce sexual
or romantic attractions or feelings toward individuals of the same sex
deserve to be discouraged, muted, or banned?
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
(f) Yes or no: In the event AB 2943 is fully enacted into law, will
Facebook comply with its provisions by removing, denying, downgrading,
concealing, or otherwise censoring content and advertisements
restricted by the bill? If so, does Facebook intend to remove, deny,
downgrade, conceal, or otherwise censor content and advertisements that
pertain to the Bible, the Torah, the Koran, and other books which
advance traditional sexual ethics.
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
Question 32. If an individual posted any of the following
statements, standing alone and not directed to any Facebook user in
particular, would that statement violate Facebook's ``hate speech''
policy? To the extent that the decision would depend on additional
facts, please describe whether the statement would prompt an
investigation to determine whether it constitutes ``hate speech,'' and
whether the decision would involve algorithmic or human decision
making.
(a) There are only two sexes or two genders, male and female.
(b) Bathroom segregation based on sex is similar to segregation
based on race.
(c) God created man in his image, male and female.
(d) Gender is a social construct.
(e) A person's sex or gender are immutable characteristics.
(f) Sex reassignment surgery is a form of bodily mutilation.
(g) The abortion of an unborn child is murder.
(h) It should be a crime to perform or facilitate an abortion.
(i) It should be a crime to prevent someone from performing or
obtaining an abortion.
(j) No person of faith should be required to assist a same-sex
wedding by providing goods or services to a same-sex marrying couple.
(k) When an individual enters the marketplace, he gives up the
right to choose whether to support a same-sex marriage.
(l) Islam is a religion of peace.
(m) Islam is a religion of war.
(n) All white people are inherently racist.
(o) All black people are inherently racist.
(p) Black lives matter.
(q) Blue lives matter.
(r) All lives matter.
(s) Donating to the NRA funds the murder of children, such as those
slain in Parkland, Florida.
(t) Donating to Planned Parenthood funds the murder of children,
such as those dismembered by Kermit Gosnell.
(u) Men should stop interrupting when women are talking.
(v) Women should stop interrupting when men are talking.
(w) DREAMers are Americans too and should be entitled to stay in
this country.
(x) Illegal aliens need to be sent back.
(y) Religious beliefs are irrational and anti-science.
(z) Non-believers have no path to eternal salvation.
(aa) Affirmative Action policies discriminate on the basis of race
and sex.
(bb) America is a ``melting pot.''
Answer. See Response to Question 27.
Question 33. Facebook states on its website that per its community
standards, ``organizations and people dedicated to promoting hatred''
against protected groups are not allowed a presence on Facebook.
(a) What standards or policies does Facebook apply in determining
whether a group violates this policy?
Answer. See Response to Question 15.
(b) Yes or no: Does Facebook contract with or in any way rely upon
an outside party to determine what organizations and people are
dedicated to promoting hatred against protected groups? If yes, please
list the outside parties.
Answer. See Response to Question 15.
(c) Yes or no: Has Facebook ever referenced, used, consulted, or in
any way relied upon the left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center's list of
designated hate groups in order to determine whether an organization or
individual was dedicated to promoting hatred against protected groups?
Answer. See Response to Question 15.
(d) Yes or no: Has Facebook ever denied an organization a presence
on Facebook on account of the organization being dedicated to promoting
hatred? If so, has Facebook ever reversed its decision to designate an
organization a hate group under its community standards and reinstated
the organization's privilege to post and have a presence on Facebook?
Answer. See Response to Question 15.
Question 34. One group on Facebook, ``TERMINATE the Republican
Party,'' has over 10,000 followers, one of which was James T.
Hodgkinson. In June 2017, Hodgkinson opened fire on Republican members
of Congress at a baseball practice, seriously wounding Rep. Steve
Scalise, a congressional staffer, and two heroic police officers.
Quotes from this group's posts and comments include that ``These people
are all the same, criminals, rapists, racists, Republicans;'' that,
about Rep. Patrick McHenry, ``who gives birth to sorry pieces of s***
like him and allowed it to reach adulthood, truly needs a f*****g
hammer to the head a few times;'' and, referring to the President,
``G*****n Russian roach traitor bastard . . . and his Republicanazi
followers!'' Each of these quotes took place long after Hodgkinson's
shooting, though similar quotes are available from before it as well.
(a) Do these quotes constitute ``hate speech?''
(i) If so, why have they not been removed?
(ii) If not, why do they not?
(b) If applied to Democrats, would the quotes above constitute
``hate speech?''
(c) How has Facebook changed its platform in response to
Hodgkinson's shooting? It has apparently not suspended or ended this
group.
(d) Does it concern Facebook that such rhetoric is being used in a
group which had an attempted political assassin as a member?
(e) Does Facebook permit threats of violence against the President?
(f) Does Facebook permit threats of violence against members of
Congress?
(g) Does Facebook monitor its platforms for potential left-wing
violence?
(i) If so, what is Facebook doing to ensure that shooters like
Hodgkinson do not coordinate using Facebook?
(ii) If so, what is Facebook doing to ensure that shooters like
Hodgskinson do not use Facebook to incite violence against
Republicans or conservatives?
(iv) If not, why is Facebook not doing so given that its
platform was integral to at least one attempted political
assassination?
Answer. The shooting at the Congressional baseball practice was a
horrendous act. As a designated mass shooting, any praise for that
conduct or the shooter is against Facebook policies. We also do not
allow any pages or accounts representing the shooter. If we are made
aware of such comments, we would take them down.
We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we
call protected characteristics--race, ethnicity, national origin,
religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender
identity, and serious disability or disease. We also provide some
protections for immigration status. Political-party affiliation is not
included in our list of protected characteristics. We define attack as
violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls
for exclusion or segregation. Our detailed hate speech policies are
available at https://www.facebook.com/
communitystandards/objectionable_content/hate_speech.
Our credible violence policies prohibit posting credible statements
of intent to commit violence against any person, groups of people, or
place (city or smaller). We assess credibility based upon the
information available to us and generally consider statements credible
if the following are present:
A target (person, group of people, or place) and:
Bounty/demand for payment, or
Mention or image of specific weapon, or
Sales offer or ask to purchase weapon, or
Spelled-out address or named building, or
A target and 2 or more of the following details (can be 2 of
the same detail):
Location
Timing
Method
We also prohibit calls for violence, statements advocating
violence, or aspirational or conditional statements of violence
targeting public individuals, provided those statements are credible,
as defined above. Any calls for violence against heads of state,
including the United States President, violate our policies.
There are times someone might share something that would otherwise
be considered hate speech but for non-hateful reasons, such as making a
self-deprecating joke or quoting lyrics from a song. People often use
satire and comedy to make a point about hate speech. In other cases,
people may speak out against hatred by condemning someone else's use of
offensive language, which requires repeating the original offense. This
is something we allow, even though it might seem questionable since it
means some people may encounter material disturbing to them.
Question 35. In July 2012, Governor Mike Huckabee praised Chick-
fil-A because of its support for traditional marriage and called on
Christians to support Chick-fil-A in its position by purchasing its
products. Facebook temporarily removed Governor Huckabee's post from
its service before reinstating it.
(a) Why was Governor Huckabee's post removed?
(b) What Facebook rule was Governor Huckabee's post thought to have
violated before it was reinstated?
(c) Did Governor Huckabee's post violate Facebook's prohibition on
``hate speech,'' either in 2012 or now?
(d) Does a post opposing the Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell
v. Hodges violate Facebook's prohibition on ``hate speech?''
(e) Does a post opposing legalized same-sex marriage violate
Facebook's prohibition on ``hate speech?''
(f) As of July 2012, had Facebook removed, downgraded, concealed,
or otherwise censored any content created by a state Governor, member
of the U.S. House of Representatives, member of the U.S. Senate, or the
President on account of that individual's support for same-sex
marriage? If so, please include the removed content including
identifying information indicating its author.
(g) As of July 2012, had Facebook removed, downgraded, concealed,
or otherwise censored any other content created by a state Governor,
member of the U.S. House of Representatives, member of the U.S. Senate,
or the President on account of that individual's opposition to same-sex
marriage? If so, please include the removed content including
identifying information indicating its author.
(h) Has, since July 2012, Facebook removed, downgraded, concealed,
or otherwise censored any posts by a state Governor, member of the U.S.
House of Representatives, member of the U.S. Senate, or the President
on account of that individual's (or that content's) opposition to same-
sex marriage? If so, please include the removed post identifying
information indicating its author.
(i) Has, since July 2012, Facebook removed, downgraded, concealed,
or otherwise censored any posts by a state Governor, member of the U.S.
House of Representatives, member of the U.S. Senate, or the President
on account of that individual's (or that content's) support for same-
sex marriage? If so, please include the removed post identifying
information indicating its author.
(j) Under what circumstances does Facebook remove, downgrade,
conceal, or otherwise censor content that, though not threatening
physical harm, promoting imminent physical self-harm, or advocating for
terrorism, opposes same-sex marriage?
(k) Under what circumstances does Facebook remove, downgrade,
conceal, or otherwise censor content that, though not threatening
physical harm, promoting imminent physical self-harm, or advocating for
terrorism, supports same-sex marriage?
Answer. In July 2012, our automated systems incorrectly removed an
event page entitled ``Chick-fil-A Appreciation Day.'' The page was
restored within hours of coming to our attention. When we make mistakes
on these important content decisions, we make every attempt to make it
right as quickly as we can.
Our goal is to allow people to have as much expression as possible,
including on the issue of same-sex marriage. We err on the side of
allowing content, even when some find it objectionable, unless removing
that content prevents a specific harm.
See also Response to Question 27.
Question 36. As described in the Washington Post, in October 2012,
Facebook removed a post by a group called ``Special Operations
Speaks.'' The post said: ``Obama called the SEALs and THEY got bin
Laden. When the SEALs called Obama, they got denied,'' a reference to
the failure of the Executive Branch to provide military support to
Americans under assault, and later killed, in Benghazi. Facebook first
warned the group that the post violated its rules and then subsequently
removed the post as a violation of ``Facebook's Statements of Rights
and Responsibilities.'' Facebook further suspended Special Operations
Speaks for 24 hours following the removal. Facebook later admitted
error and permitted the content to remain on its platform.
(a) Why was Special Operations Speaks' post removed?
(b) What term of Facebook's then-extant 2012 Statement of Rights
and Responsibilities was Special Operations Speaks' post thought to
have violated before Facebook reversed its decision?
(c) Yes or no: Did any member of the Obama Administration,
including any administrative agency then-directed by an executive
official appointed by the Obama administration, contact Facebook to
request that the post be removed?
(i) If so, whom?
(ii) What was Facebook's response?
(d) Yes or no: Did Facebook assure any government official or
employee that this post would be removed? If so, whom?
(e) Did Special Operations Speaks' post violate Facebook's
prohibition on ``hate speech,'' either in 2012 or now?
(f) As of October 2012, had Facebook removed, downgraded,
concealed, or otherwise censored any other content created by a
political action committee on the basis of that content's disapproval
of how the Obama administration handled the attack on U.S. diplomats
and servicemen in Benghazi? If so, please include the removed content
including identifying information about its author.
(g) As of October 2012, had Facebook removed, downgraded,
concealed, or otherwise censored any content created by a political
action committee on the basis of that content's approval of how the
Obama administration handled the attack on U.S. diplomats and
servicemen in Benghazi? If so, please include the removed content
including identifying information about its author.
(h) Has, since October 2012, Facebook removed, downgraded,
concealed, or otherwise censored any posts by a political action
committee on the basis of that content's disapproval of how the Obama
administration handled the attack on U.S. diplomats and servicemen in
Benghazi? If so, please include the removed content including
identifying information about its author.
(i) Has, since October 2012, Facebook removed, downgraded,
concealed, or otherwise censored any posts by a political action
committee on the basis of that content's disapproval of how the Obama
administration handled the attack on U.S. diplomats and servicemen in
Benghazi? If so, please include the removed content including
identifying information about its author.
(j) Under what circumstances does Facebook remove, downgrade,
conceal, or otherwise censor content that, though not threatening
physical harm, promoting imminent physical self-harm, or advocating for
terrorism, opposes the Obama Administration's handling of the attacks
on U.S. diplomats and servicemen in Benghazi?
(k) Under what circumstances does Facebook remove, downgrade,
conceal, or otherwise censor content that, though not threatening
physical harm, promoting imminent physical self-harm, supports the
Obama Administration's handling of the attacks on U.S. diplomats and
servicemen in Benghazi?
Answer. In this particular case, we removed the content as a
violation of our standards. The content was deleted for 29 hours.
However, we realized that we made a mistake, and we restored the
content and apologized for the error.
We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we
call protected characteristics--race, ethnicity, national origin,
religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender
identity, and serious disability or disease. We also provide some
protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or
dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion
or segregation. Our detailed hate speech policies are available at
https://www.facebook.com/com
munitystandards/objectionable_content/hate_speech.
Our Community Standards prohibit hate speech and celebrating
graphic violence and allow people to use Facebook to raise awareness of
and condemn violence. Drawing that line requires complex and nuanced
judgments, and we carefully review reports that we receive from the
public, media, civil society, and governments. We remove content that
violates our policies, regardless of who posted the content.
Question 37. In September 2017, Facebook deemed the videos of two
African American Trump supporters, known as Diamond and Silk, as
``dangerous.'' In a company e-mail, Facebook stated that the decision
was final and ``not appealable in any way.'' Facebook then retracted
this statement, explaining that the determination was inaccurate.
(a) What about Diamond and Silk did Facebook initially determine to
be ``dangerous?''
(b) What is Facebook's criteria for determining whether content
that neither depicts nor advocates for violence as ``dangerous?''
(c) Aside from the illustration of or advocacy for violence, under
what conditions is the discussion of non-classified speech
``dangerous?''
(d) Has Facebook implemented an appeals system by which users can
challenge a determination of dangerousness?
(e) How often does Facebook retract these determinations?
(f) What is the internal review process for these types of
determinations?
Answer. We mishandled communication with Diamond and Silk for
months. Their frustration was understandable, and we apologized to
them. The message they received on April 5, 2018 that characterized
their Page as ``dangerous'' was incorrect and not reflective of the way
we seek to communicate with our community and the people who run Pages
on our platform.
As part of our commitment to continually improve our products and
to minimize risks where human judgment is involved, we are making a
number of changes:
We have engaged an outside advisor, former Senator Jon Kyl,
to advise the company on potential bias against conservative
voices. We believe this external feedback will help us improve
over time and ensure we can most effectively serve our diverse
community.
We continue to expand our list of outside organizations from
across the political spectrum to provide feedback on potential
changes to our content standards.
We have made our detailed reviewer guidelines public to help
people understand how and why we make decisions about the
content that is and is not allowed on Facebook.
We have launched an appeals process to enable people to
contest content decisions with which they disagree. We
recognize that we make enforcement errors on both sides of the
equation--what to allow, and what to remove--and that our
mistakes cause a great deal of concern for people, which is why
we need to allow the option to request review of the decision
and provide additional context that will help our team see the
fuller picture as they review the post again. This type of
feedback will allow us to continue improving our systems and
processes so we can prevent similar mistakes in the future.

Question 38. In October 2017, the social-media company Twitter
refused to permit Representative Marsha Blackburn to pay to promote a
campaign advertisement because Rep. Blackburn stated that she fought to
stop the sale of children's body parts. Twitter's explanation was that
Blackburn's critique of ``the sale of baby body parts'' was an
``inflammatory statement'' that Twitter refused to advertise.
(a) Does Representative Blackburn's campaign advertisement
(available readily on the internet) violate Facebook's policies
regarding acceptable advertisements?
(b) Does Representative Blackburn's campaign advertisement violate
Facebook's policies against ``hate speech?''
(c) Would the statement, standing alone, that Planned Parenthood
sells baby body parts qualify as ``hate speech?''
(d) Would Facebook censor or otherwise downgrade or make
unavailable the statement that Planned Parenthood sells baby body parts
for any other reason?
Answer. As Facebook indicated publicly in October 2017,
Representative Blackburn's campaign advertisement, in which she
mentioned ``the sale of baby body parts'' does not violate our
Advertising Policies or our Community Standards.
We work to strike the right balance between enabling free
expression around the globe and ensuring that our platform is safe. We
currently define hate speech as anything that directly attacks people
based on protected characteristics--race, ethnicity, national origin,
religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender
identity, or serious disability or disease. We remove content that
violates our policies, regardless of who posted the content, including
the government.
Our policies allow content that may be controversial and at times
even distasteful, but which does not cross the line into hate speech.
This may include criticism of public figures, religions, professions,
and political ideologies.
Question 39. Louis Farrakhan presently employs Facebook to reach
numerous individuals. At present, he has over a million followers.
(a) On his Facebook page, Farrakhan links to an open letter of his
which states: ``We can now present to our people and the world a true,
undeniable record of the relationship between Blacks and Jews from
their own mouths and pens. These scholars, Rabbis and historians have
given to us an undeniable record of Jewish anti-Black behavior,
starting with the horror of the trans-Atlantic slave trade, plantation
slavery, Jim Crow, sharecropping, the labor movement of the North and
South, the unions and the misuse of our people that continues to this
very moment.''
(i) Does this statement violate Facebook's policies against
``hate speech?''
(ii) If so, why has this post been permitted to remain?
(iii) If not, why not?
(b) On his Facebook page, Farrakhan links to a sermon in which he
describes the ``Synagogue of Satan'' and its attempts to harm him.
(i) Is the term ``Synagogue of Satan'' a violation of
Facebook's policies against ``hate speech?''
(ii) If so, why has this post been permitted to remain?
(iii) If not, why not?
Answer. We are committed to designing our products to give all
people a voice and foster the free flow of ideas and culture. That
said, when something crosses the line into hate speech, it has no place
on Facebook, and we are committed to removing it from our platform any
time we become aware of it.
We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we
call protected characteristics--race, ethnicity, national origin,
religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender
identity, and serious disability or disease. We also provide some
protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or
dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion
or segregation. The detailed guidelines our reviewers use to assess
whether content violates our hate speech policies are available at
https://www.facebook.com/communitystan
dards/objectionable_content/hate_speech.
Question 40. In June 2013, Facebook blocked the following post
written by Fox News Radio's Todd Starnes for violating Facebook's
community standards, ``I'm about as politically incorrect as you can
get. I'm wearing an NRA ball cap, eating a Chick-fil-A sandwich,
reading a Paula Deen cookbook and sipping a 20-ounce sweet tea while
sitting in my Cracker Barrel rocking chair with the Gather Vocal Band
singing `Jesus Saves' on the stereo and a Gideon's Bible in my pocket.
Yes sir, I'm politically incorrect and happy as a June bug.'' Although
Facebook ultimately reversed its decision, for several hours, Todd
Starnes could not access either his fan or person page.
(a) Why was Todd Starnes' post removed?
(b) What Facebook rule was Todd Starnes' post thought to have
violated before it was reinstated?
(c) Was any part of Starnes' statement ``hate speech?''
(d) Was any part of Starnes' statement considered harassment?
(e) Yes or no: must posted content be ``politically correct'' to
remain in accordance with Facebook's community standards?
(f) Is a statement that something is not ``politically correct'' a
violation of Facebook's standards?
Answer. The page where Todd Starnes posted the content was not
unpublished. He was the administrator that made the post, and the
action was taken on his profile. He posted the content at around 2 a.m.
on June 29, 2013, and it was restored shortly before 10 a.m. the same
day. During that time, he did not lose his ability to access either his
profile or his page, just the post itself. When we reinstated the post,
we sent him an apology the same day.
Our policies apply equally to individuals and entities across the
political spectrum. We are committed to designing our products to give
all people a voice and foster the free flow of ideas and culture. That
said, when something crosses the line into hate speech, it has no place
on Facebook, and we are committed to removing it from our platform any
time we become aware of it.
We recognize that our policies are only as good as the strength and
accuracy of our enforcement--and our enforcement is not perfect. We
make mistakes because our processes involve people, and people are not
infallible. We are always working to improve.
When we're made aware of incorrect content removals, we review them
with team members so as to prevent similar mistakes in the future. We
also audit the accuracy of reviewer decisions on an ongoing basis to
coach them and follow up on improving, where errors are being made.
We hope that our recent decision to publicize our detailed
Community Standards--which reflect our internal reviewer guidelines--
and the introduction of appeals will aid in this process. By providing
more clarity on what is and isn't allowed on Facebook, we hope that
people will better understand how our policies apply to them. Where
people believe we have made a mistake, they can request review of our
decisions.

Question 41. How many individuals at Facebook have the ability to
moderate, remove, downgrade, conceal, or otherwise censor content, ban,
suspend, warn, or otherwise discipline users, or approve, price,
review, or refuse advertisements on the platform? This question
includes individuals with the power to alter search results and similar
mechanisms that suggest additional content to users in order to to
promote or demote content, whether individually or routinely through an
algorithm or by altering any of the platform's search functions.
(Please include all employees, independent contractors, or others with
such ability at Facebook.)
(a) Into what divisions or groups are those individuals organized?
(b) Who are the individuals responsible for supervising these
individuals as their conduct relates to American citizens, nationals,
businesses, and groups?
(c) We understand from your April 10 testimony that Facebook has
approximately 15,000 to 20,000 moderators. How many individuals have
the responsibility to moderate, remove, downgrade, conceal, or
otherwise censor content, ban, suspend, warn, or otherwise discipline
users, or approve, price, review, or refuse advertisements as a primary
or significant function of their role at Facebook? This question
includes individuals with the power to alter search results and similar
mechanisms that suggest additional content to users in order to to
promote or demote content, whether individually or routinely through an
algorithm or by altering any of the platform's search functions. (Going
forward, we will refer to these individuals, with a primary or
significant responsibility for reviewing content, users, or
advertisements, as ``moderators.'')
(d) Who are the individuals responsible for supervising these
moderators as their conduct relates to American citizens, nationals,
businesses, and groups?
(e) How many moderators has Facebook had on its platform for each
of the calendar years 2006 to 2018? Please provide approximations if
exact numbers are impossible to obtain.
(f) How many moderators does Facebook intend to retain for the
years 2019 and 2020?
(g) On average, how many pieces of content (e.g., a Facebook post,
an Instagram photo, and so on) does a moderator remove a day?
(h) On average, how many users does a moderator discipline a day?
(i) On average, how many advertisements does a moderator approve,
disapprove, price, consult on, review, or refuse a day?
Answer. Our content reviewers respond to millions of reports each
week from people all over the world.
Our community of users helps us by reporting accounts or content
that may violate our policies. Our content review teams around the
world--which grew by 3,000 people last year--work 24 hours a day and in
dozens of languages to review these reports. By the end of 2018, we
will have doubled the number of people working on safety and security
as compared to the beginning of the year--to a total of 20,000.
To help the Facebook community better understand our efforts to
enforce the Community Standards, we recently published a Community
Standards Enforcement Preliminary Report (https://
transparency.facebook.com/community-standards-enforcement) describing
the amount and types of content we take action against, as well as the
amount of content that we flag for review proactively.
We are also committed to getting better at enforcing our
advertising policies. We review many ads proactively using automated
and manual tools, and reactively when people hide, block, or mark ads
as offensive. We are taking aggressive steps to strengthen both our
automated and our manual review. We are also expanding our global ads
review teams and investing more in machine learning to better
understand when to flag and take down ads, such as ads that offer
employment or credit opportunity while including or excluding
multicultural advertising segments. Enforcement is never perfect, but
we will get better at finding and removing improper ads.

Answer. A user's News Feed is made up of stories from their
friends, Pages they've chosen to follow and groups they've joined.
Ranking is the process we use to organize all of those stories so that
users can see the most relevant content at the top, every time they
open Facebook. Ranking has four elements: the available inventory of
stories; the signals, or data points that can inform ranking decisions;
the predictions we make, including how likely we think a user is to
comment on a story, share with a friend, etc.; and a relevancy score
for each story.
News Feed considers thousands of signals to surface the content
that's most relevant to each person who uses Facebook. Our employees
don't determine the ranking of any specific piece of content. To help
the community understand how News Feed works and how changes to News
Feed affect their experience on Facebook, we publish a regularly-
updated News Feed FYI blog (https://newsroom.fb.com/news/category/
inside-feed/) where our team shares details of significant changes.
Question 48. What percentage of the individuals who design, code,
implement, monitor, correct, or alter any of these algorithms:
(a) Self-identify as Democrats?
(b) Are registered as Democrats?
(c) Self-identify as liberal?
(d) Self-identify as Republicans?
(e) Are registered as Republicans?
(f) Self-identify as conservative?
Answer. We do not maintain statistics on these data points.
Question 49. In 2016, in response to complaints about ``fake news''
during the 2016 Presidential campaign and following President Trump's
election, Facebook procured the services of specific ``fact-checking''
outlets in order to flag certain stories or sources as disputed,
challenged, or incorrect. Earlier this year, it additionally changed
one or more of the algorithms that recommend websites to users, such as
users' news feeds.
(a) On what basis did Facebook select the fact-checking
organizations that it enlisted to identify incorrect assertions of
fact?
(b) Numerous sources have cited the presence of political bias in
many ``fact-checking'' organizations; for example, according to one
2013 study by George Mason University's Center for Media and Public
Affairs, the site Politifact.com--which Facebook employs to check facts
on its platform--was between two and three times more likely to rate
Republicans' claims as false (32 percent) than Democrats' claims (11
percent), and was between two and three times more likely to rate
Democrats' statements as mostly or entirely true (54 percent) compared
to Republicans' statements (18 percent). Indeed, the RealClearPolitics
``Fact Check Review'' notes that, in the last 120 days, approximately
1/6th of ``facts'' that Politifact.com claims to check aren't facts at
all, but mere opinions.
(i) What steps does Facebook take to counteract liberal or
left-wing bias by fact-checking outlets?
(ii) What steps does Facebook intend to take to bring political
balance to its fact-checking review process?
(iii) What mechanisms for appealing a determination that a
statement is false or otherwise disagreed-with does Facebook
make available to entities that Politifact (or others)
accuse(s) of lying?
(1) If none exist, what mechanisms does Facebook intend
to make available?
(2) If none exist, to what extent will Facebook make
its review of these claims publicly visible?
(iv) Has Facebook ever labeled claims or articles by any of the
following entities as false? If so, please identify which
claims and when.
(1) Huffington Post
(2) Salon
(3) Slate
(4) ThinkProgress
(5) Media Matters for America
(6) ShareBlue
(7) The Daily Kos
(8) Vice
(9) Vox
(10) TalkingPointsMemo
(v) Does Facebook consider the basis for a fact-checker's
determination that something is ``false'' when choosing to
label it as such? For example, as numerous media outlets have
noted, some fact-checking outlets concede that the factual
statement a public figure has made is true, but then condemn it
for lacking ``context'' or spin favorable to a left-wing
politician.
(1) If so, how does Facebook consider it?
(2) If not, does Facebook intend to do so in the
future? And if so, how? If not, why not?
(c) When one of Facebook's fact-checkers determines that a claim is
false, how does Facebook determine what material to refer a user to in
response? Please list all such sources and any method relied on for
determining their priority.
(d) Facebook's 2018 alteration of its algorithm has had a noted and
outsized impact on traffic to conservative websites while not having a
similar effect on liberal websites. At least one study by the Western
Journal estimated liberal publishers' traffic from Facebook rose
approximately 2 percent following the change, while conservative
publishers' traffic declined approximately 14 percent.
(i) In what way(s) did Facebook change its content-screening or
news-suggesting algorithms, or any other feature of its website
which suggests content to users, in this 2018 instance?
(1) Were any components of these changes intended to
have a differential impact on conservative outlets
versus liberal ones?
(2) Were any components of these changes expected to
have a differential impact on conservative outlets
versus liberal ones?
(ii) Measured against pre-change traffic, how has the traffic
of liberal publishers changed following this 2018 instance?
(iii) Measured against pre-change traffic, how has the traffic
of conservative publishers changed following this 2018
instance?
(iv) Measured against pre-change traffic, how has this 2018
instance changed the traffic of the following publishers:
(1) The Washington Post
(2) The New York Times
(3) The Washington Times
(4) The New York Post
(5) The New York Daily News
(6) Fox News
(7) National Review
(8) The Daily Beast
(9) Huffington Post
(10) Buzzfeed
(11) Newsweek
(12) The Daily Wire
(13) Vice
(14) USA Today
(15) Salon
(16) Slate
(17) Vox
(18) The Daily Caller
(19) The Blaze
(20) PJ Media
(21) The Washington Free Beacon
(22) Reuters
(23) The Associated Press
(24) National Public Radio
(25) Bloomberg
(v) Does Facebook intend to do anything to reduce the
differential effect on its recent algorithmic changes on
conservative publishers?
(1) If so, what?
(2) If not, why not?
Answer. To reduce the spread of false news, one of the things we're
doing is working with third-party fact checkers to let people know when
they are sharing news stories (excluding satire and opinion) that have
been disputed or debunked, and to limit the distribution of stories
that have been flagged as misleading, sensational, or spammy. Third-
party fact-checkers on Facebook are signatories to the non-partisan
International Fact-Checking Network Code of Principles. Third-party
fact-checkers investigate stories in a journalistic process meant to
result in establishing the truth or falsity of the story.
In the United States, Facebook uses third-party fact-checking by
the Associated Press, Factcheck.org, PolitiFact, Snopes, and the Weekly
Standard Fact Check.
Publishers may reach out directly to the third-party fact-checking
organizations if (1) they have corrected the rated content, or if (2)
they believe the fact-checker's rating is inaccurate. To issue a
correction, the publisher must correct the false content and clearly
state that a correction was made directly on the story. To dispute a
rating, the publisher must clearly indicate why the original rating was
inaccurate. If a rating is successfully corrected or disputed, the
demotion on the content will be lifted and the strike against the
domain or Page will be removed. It may take a few days to see the
distribution for the domain or Page recover. Additionally, any recovery
will be affected by other false news strikes and related interventions
(like demotions for clickbait). Corrections and disputes are processed
at the fact-checker's discretion. Fact-checkers are asked to respond to
requests in a reasonable time period--ideally one business day for a
simple correction, and up to a few business days for more complex
disputes.
We want Facebook to be a place where people can discover more news,
information, and perspectives, and we are working to build products
that help.
As to the questions regarding ranking and algorithmic changes, see
Response to Question 47.
Question 50. Facebook's Help section explains that the posts that
users see are influenced by their connections and activity on Facebook,
including the number of comments, likes, and reactions a post receives
and what kind of story it is. Some reporting suggests that Facebook's
algorithm functions based on the content available (inventory),
considerations about the content (signals), considerations about a
person (predictions), and overall score.
(a) How do Facebook employees determine how informative a post is
or which interactions create a more meaningful experience?
(b) Does a speaker's viewpoint determine in whole or part how
informative or meaningful a post is?
(c) Does a speaker's partisan affiliation determine in whole or
part how informative or meaningful a post is?
(d) Does a speaker's religious affiliation determine in whole or
part how informative or meaningful a post is?
Answer. See Response to Question 47.

Answer. Facebook offered identical support to both the Trump and
Clinton campaigns, and had teams assigned to both. Everyone had access
to the same tools, which are the same tools that every campaign is
offered.
See also Response to Question 54.
Question 54. Please provide Facebook's advertising rates for each
U.S. Senate and U.S. House election for which Facebook quoted or sold
advertisements to one or more candidates for the years 2008, 2010,
2012, 2014, 2016, and 2018. For elections not falling in those years or
special elections, please provide and group these rates with the next
sequential election cycle. Where Facebook offered or sold advertising
to multiple candidates within the same race, please pair those quotes
or prices together along with party affiliation.
Answer. People can run ads on Facebook, Instagram and Audience
Network on any budget. The exact cost associated with an ad being shown
to someone is determined in Facebook's ad auction.
Question 55. Yes or no: has Facebook ever provided at no cost
advertising to political candidates, campaign committees, political
action committees or similar groups, or issue-advocacy groups or
campaigns, whether through outright advertising or by altering search
rankings, trending topics, content rankings, or the position of content
within any suggested content mechanism?
(a) If so, please provide each instance in which Facebook has done
so and indicate whether Facebook offered similar support to any other
candidate or issue in that race or election.
(b) If so, please indicate whether Facebook coordinated with that
campaign, candidate, or issue in doing so, or if Facebook acted
unilaterally.
Answer. Political candidates, campaign committees, political action
committees and similar groups, as well as issue advocacy groups and
campaigns can set up Facebook Pages for free and post free content via
those Pages, in the same way that any Page creator may. To run ads on
Facebook, a form of payment must be provided. The algorithms that set
content rankings are not designed to promote any candidate or party.
Question 56. Please list and describe all mandatory trainings that
Facebook employees are required to undergo and the topics involved in
each, including any trainings on sexual harassment, unconscious bias,
racial privilege, and inclusivity.
Answer. At Facebook, we treat any allegations of harassment,
discrimination, or retaliation with the utmost seriousness, and we have
invested significant time and resources into developing our policies
and processes. We have made our policies and processes available
publicly--not because we think we have all the answers, but because we
believe that the more companies are open about their policies, the more
we can all learn from one another. Our internal policies on sexual
harassment and bullying are available on our Facebook People Practices
website (http://peoplepractices.fb.com/), along with details of our
investigation process and tips and resources we have found helpful in
preparing our Respectful Workplace internal trainings. Our philosophy
on harassment, discrimination, and bullying is to go above and beyond
what is required by law. Our policies prohibit intimidating, offensive,
and sexual conduct even when that conduct might not meet the legal
standard of harassment. Even if it's legally acceptable, it's not the
kind of behavior we want in our workplace. In developing our policies,
we were guided by six basic principles:
First, develop training that sets the standard for
respectful behavior at work, so people understand what's
expected of them right from the start. In addition to
prescribing mandatory harassment training, we wrote our own
unconscious bias training program at Facebook, which is also
available publicly on our People Practices website. Our
training includes Sustainable Equity, a three-day course in the
U.S. about racial privilege and injustice, and Design for
Inclusion, a multi-day course in the UK to educate on systemic
inequity.
Second, treat all claims--and the people who voice them--
with seriousness, urgency, and respect. At Facebook, we make
sure to have HR business partners available to support everyone
on the team, not just senior leaders.
Third, create an investigation process that protects
employees from stigma or retaliation. Facebook has an
investigations team made up of experienced HR professionals and
lawyers trained to handle sensitive cases of sexual harassment
and assault.
Fourth, follow a process that is consistently applied in
every case and is viewed by employees as providing fair
procedures for both victims and those accused.
Fifth, take swift and decisive action when it is determined
that wrongdoing has occurred. We have a zero-tolerance policy,
and that means that when we are able to determine that
harassment has occurred, those responsible are fired.
Unfortunately, in some cases investigations are inconclusive
and come down to one person's word against another's. When we
don't feel we can make a termination decision, we take other
actions designed to help everyone feel safe, including changing
people's roles and reporting lines.
Sixth, make it clear that all employees are responsible for
keeping the workplace safe--and anyone who is silent or looks
the other way is complicit. There's no question that it is
complicated and challenging to get this right. We are by no
means perfect, and there will always be bad actors. Unlike law
enforcement agencies, companies don't have access to forensic
evidence and instead have to rely on reported conversations,
written evidence, and the best judgment of investigators and
legal experts. What we can do is be as transparent as possible,
share best practices, and learn from one another--recognizing
that policies will evolve as we gain experience. We don't have
everything worked out at Facebook on these issues, but we will
never stop striving to make sure we have a safe and respectful
working environment for all our people.
We are also working to reduce unconscious bias. Our publicly
available Managing Unconscious Bias class encourages our people to
challenge and correct bias as soon as they see it--in others, and in
themselves. We've also doubled down by adding two additional internal
programs: Managing Inclusion, which trains managers to understand the
issues that affect marginalized communities, and Be The Ally, which
gives everyone the common language, tools, and space to practice
supporting others.
Question 57. Please list and describe all optional recommended
trainings that Facebook employees are required to undergo and the
topics involved in each, including any trainings on sexual harassment,
unconscious bias, racial privilege, and inclusivity.
Answer. See Response to Question 56.
Question 58. Do any of the materials Facebook uses in any of these
trainings identify different preferences, values, goals, ideas, world-
views, or abilities among individuals on the basis of the following? If
so, please list each and include those materials.
(a) Race
(b) Sex
(c) Sexual orientation
(d) Place of origin
Answer. Diversity is core to our business at Facebook and we're
committed to building and maintaining a workforce as diverse and
inclusive as the people and communities we serve. We have developed and
implemented programs and groups to help build a more diverse and
inclusive company, and to better engage and support employees from
diverse backgrounds. We have a number of Facebook Resource Groups
(FBRGs) that are run by our internal communities from different
backgrounds, such as Asians and Pacific Islanders, African-Americans,
People with Disabilities, those of faith, Latinos/Hispanics, LGBTQ,
Veterans, and women. These FBRGs provide members with support, foster
understanding between all people, and can coordinate programming to
further support members. Examples of such programs include [email protected]
Leadership Day, [email protected] Leadership Day, [email protected] Leadership Day, and
[email protected] Leadership Day. Facebook also values and creates programming to
support its Veterans and People with Disabilities through dedicated
program managers and recruiters, mentoring programs and awareness
campaigns to promote education and inclusion. These groups and programs
are created to support and provide a more inclusive work experience for
people from diverse backgrounds, with membership and participation open
even to those who do not self-identify with these groups. For example,
people who do not self-identify as Black are still members of [email protected]
and have attended [email protected] Leadership Day, and there are male members of
[email protected] and men can attend [email protected] Leadership Day. Facebook is also an
Equal Opportunity Employer.
Question 59. Facebook acknowledges that it is located in a very
liberal part of the country, and has suggested that it understands that
many of its employees as well as the surrounding community share a
particular (very liberal) culture.
(a) Does Facebook have any training specifically aimed at
discouraging political, ideological, or partisan bias in decision-
making by its employees?
(b) Does Facebook have any training specifically aimed at
discouraging political, ideological, or partisan bias in hiring,
retention, promotion, and firing of its employees?
(c) Does Facebook have any training specifically aimed at
discouraging political, ideological, or partisan bias in the monitoring
and supervision of content, users, or advertisements on each of its
platforms?
Answer. Our Community Standards are global and all reviewers use
the same guidelines when making decisions.
They undergo extensive training when they join and, thereafter, are
regularly trained and tested with specific examples on how to uphold
the Community Standards and take the correct action on a piece of
content. This training includes when policies are clarified, or as they
evolve.
We seek to write actionable policies that clearly distinguish
between violating and non-violating content and we seek to make the
decision making process for reviewers as objective as possible.
Our reviewers are not working in an empty room. There are quality
control mechanisms as well as management on site to help or seek
guidance from if needed. When a reviewer isn't clear on the action to
take based on the Community Standards, they can pass the content
decision to another team for review.
We also audit the accuracy of reviewer decisions on an ongoing
basis to coach them and follow up on improving, where errors are being
made.
When we're made aware of incorrect content removals, we review them
with our Community Operations team so as to prevent similar mistakes in
the future.
We recently introduced the right to appeal our decisions on
individual posts so users can ask for a second opinion when they think
we've made a mistake. As a first step, we are launching appeals for
posts that were removed for nudity/sexual activity, hate speech or
graphic violence. We are working to extend this process further, by
supporting more violation types, giving people the opportunity to
provide more context that could help us make the right decision, and
making appeals available not just for content that was taken down, but
also for content that was reported and left up. We believe giving
people a voice in the process is another essential component of
building a fair system.
Question 60. Please list the names of any third-party organizations
or vendors that Facebook uses to facilitate its trainings.
Answer. We have a comprehensive training program that includes many
hours of live instructor-led training, as well as hands-on practice for
all of our reviewers.
All training materials are created in partnership with our policy
team and in-market specialists or native speakers from the region.
After starting, reviewers are regularly trained and tested with
specific examples on how to uphold the Community Standards and take the
correct action on a report. Additional training happens continuously
and when policies are clarified, or as they evolve.
Question 61. In the last five years, how many discrimination
complaints has Facebook received from Christians? Please indicate how
these complaints were resolved.
Answer. Decisions about content are made based on whether content
violates our Community Standards. A user's personal characteristics do
not influence the decisions we make, and Facebook does not track the
religious beliefs or other personal characteristics of complainants.
Question 62. Yes or no: Does Facebook offer any compensation,
amenities, trainings, or similar services to its employees on account
of their race, sex, sexual orientation, or religious affiliation? If
so, please list each and whether all other races, sexes, etc. are
provided the same compensation, amenity, etc.
Answer. See Response to Question 58.
Question 63. In August 2017, Google fired James Damore for
violating its code of conduct after Damore submitted an internal memo
criticizing the company's hiring practices and arguing that the
company's political bias created a negative work environment.
(a) Yes or no: Does Facebook agree with Google's decision to fire
James Damore?
(b) Would an individual at Facebook have been fired for publishing
a memorandum like Damore's? Assume no previous negative disciplinary
history.
(c) Does Facebook permit employees to believe that some portion of
the career differences between men and women are the result of
differing choices between the sexes?
(i) Would a Facebook employee be disciplined for mentioning
that opinion in a conversation to a willing participant?
(ii) Would a Facebook employee be disciplined for mentioning
that opinion on his or her Facebook account?
(d) Does Facebook permit employees to criticize its ``diversity''
efforts as being racist against whites or sexist against men?
(i) Would a Facebook employee be disciplined for mentioning
that opinion in a conversation to a willing participant?
(ii) Would a Facebook employee be disciplined for mentioning
that opinion on his or her Facebook account?
Answer. We try to run our company in a way where people can express
different opinions internally. We are not in a position to comment on
the personnel decisions of another company or to engage in speculation
about how we might respond in particular hypothetical circumstances.
Question 64. In October 2017, Prager University filed suit against

Answer. We are not in a position to comment on the decisions of
another company or on another company's executive's statements about a
news articles.
We are committed to designing our products to give all people a
voice and foster the free flow of ideas and culture. That said, when
something crosses the line into hate speech, it has no place on
Facebook, and we are committed to removing it from our platform any
time we become aware of it.

(c) Audio or ambient sound?
(d) Telephone usage?
(e) Text messaging?
(f) iMessaging?
(g) Physical location when the user is not using the Facebook app?
(h) Spending?
Answer. As explained in our Data Policy, we collect three basic
categories of data about people:
(1) data about things people do and share (and who they connect
with) on our services,
(2) data about the devices people use to access our services,
and
(3) data we receive from partners, including the websites and
apps that use our business tools.
As far as the amount of data we collect about people, the answer
depends on the person. People who have only recently signed up for
Facebook have usually shared only a few things--such as name, contact
information, age, and gender. Over time, as people use our products, we
receive more data from them, and this data helps us provide more
relevant content and services. That data will fall into the categories
noted above, but the specific data we receive will, in large part,
depend on how the person chooses to use Facebook. For example, some
people use Facebook to share photos, so we receive and store photos for
those people. Some people enjoy watching videos on Facebook; when they
do, we receive information about the video they watched, and we can use
that information to help show other videos in their News Feeds. Other
people seldom or never watch videos, so we do not receive the same kind
of information from them, and their News Feeds are likely to feature
fewer videos.
The data we have about people also depends on how they have used
our controls. For example, people who share photos can easily delete
those photos. The same is true of any other kind of content that people
post on our services. Through Facebook's Activity Log tool, people can
also control the information about their engagement--i.e., their likes,
shares and comments--with other people's posts. The use of these
controls of course affects the data we have about people.
Question 67. Does Facebook give its users the opportunity to opt
out of Facebook collecting its users' data while still using the
service?
Answer. The Ad Preferences tool on Facebook shows people the
advertisers whose ads the user might be seeing because they visited the
advertisers' sites or apps. The person can remove any of these
advertisers to stop seeing their ads.
In addition, the person can opt out of these types of ads
entirely--so he or she never sees those ads on Facebook based on
information we have received from other websites and apps.
We've also announced plans to build Clear History, a feature that
will enable people to see the websites and apps that send us
information when they use them, delete this information from their
accounts, and turn off our ability to store it associated with their
accounts going forward.
Apps and websites that use features such as the Like button or
Facebook Analytics send us information to make their content and ads
better. We also use this information to make user experience on
Facebook better.
If a user clears his or her history or uses the new setting, we'll
remove identifying information so a history of the websites and apps
the user used won't be associated with the user's account. We'll still
provide apps and websites with aggregated analytics--for example, we
can build reports when we're sent this information so we can tell
developers if their apps are more popular with men or women in a
certain age group. We can do this without storing the information in a
way that's associated with the user's account, and as always, we don't
tell advertisers who users are.
It will take a few months to build Clear History. We'll work with
privacy advocates, academics, policymakers and regulators to get their
input on our approach, including how we plan to remove identifying
information and the rare cases where we need information for security
purposes. We've already started a series of roundtables in cities
around the world, and heard specific demands for controls like these at
a session we held at our headquarters. We're looking forward to doing
more.
Question 68. Yes or no: In preparation for the April 10, 2018
hearing, did Facebook, employees of Facebook, or independent
contractors hired by Facebook examine the personal Facebook pages of

information sought.
(b) If so, please identify the individuals who sought such
information and what information they obtained.
(c) If so, please identify all individuals who possessed or
reviewed that information.
Answer. See Response to Question 68.
Question 74. Yes or no: Does Facebook collect data on individuals
who are not registered Facebook users?
(a) If so, does Facebook use this data as part of the advertising
products it sells?
(b) If so, does Facebook share or has Facebook ever shared this
data with third parties?
Answer. Facebook does not create profiles for people who do not
hold Facebook accounts.
When people visit apps or websites that feature our technologies--
like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers automatically log
(i) standard browser or app records of the fact that a particular
device or user visited the website or app (this connection to
Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a website
or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button, and is an
inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any additional
information the publisher of the app or website chooses to share with
Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as the fact
that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard feature of
the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same information
with multiple different third-parties whenever people visit their
website or app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's website
shares information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick and with
the analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a person visits
the Committee's website, it sends browser information about their visit
to each one of those third parties. More information about how this
works is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-
facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for this
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us--
described above--in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First,
these logs are critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to
detecting or preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser
has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign
the device might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a
potentially inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to
register for an account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide
summaries and insights to websites and apps about how many people visit
or use their product, or use specific features like our Like button--
but without providing any information about a specific person. We do
not create profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use browser and
app logs for non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from our
advertisers to them or otherwise seek to personalize the content they
see. However, we may take the opportunity to show a general ad that is
unrelated to the attributes of the person or an ad encouraging the non-
user to sign up for Facebook.
Question 75. To the extent that Facebook collects and uses data
from individuals who are not registered Facebook users, has Facebook
gained consent from those individuals to collect and use their personal
data?
Answer. Facebook does not create profiles about or track web or app
browsing history for people who are not registered users of Facebook.
Question 76. To the extent that Facebook collects and uses data
from individuals who are registered Facebook users, has Facebook
obtained those individuals' informed consent on an opt-in basis prior
to the acquisition of that data?
(a) If so, please provide the basis for concluding that data was
acquired on an informed consent basis.
(b) If so, please provide the basis for concluding that users
opted-in to Facebook's collection and commercialization of their data.
Answer. All users must expressly consent to Facebook's Terms and
Data Policy when registering for Facebook. The Data Policy explains the
kinds of information we collect, how we use this information, how we
share this information, and how users can manage and delete
information. After joining Facebook, people are presented with the
opportunity to consent to additional data collection and uses, such as
the use of location or the users' address book on their mobile device.
In response to your specific questions, depending on which Services
a person uses, we collect different kinds of information from or about
them. This is described in our Data Policy:
Things users and others do and provide.
Information and content users provide. We collect the
content, communications and other information users provide
when they use our Products, including when they sign up for an
account, create or share content, and message or communicate
with others. This can include information in or about the
content they provide (like metadata), such as the location of a
photo or the date a file was created. It can also include what
they see through features we provide, such as our camera, so
they can do things like suggest masks and filters that users
might like, or give them tips on using camera formats. Our
systems automatically process content and communications users
and others provide to analyze context and what's in them for
the purposes described below.
Data with special protections. Users can choose to
provide information in their Facebook profile fields or
Life Events about their religious views, political views,
who they are ``interested in,'' or their health. This and
other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,
philosophical beliefs or trade union membership) could be
subject to special protections under the laws of a user's
country.
Networks and connections. We collect information about the
people, Pages, accounts, hashtags, and groups users are
connected to and how users interact with them across our
Products, such as people users communicate with the most or
groups they are part of. We also collect contact information if
users choose to upload, sync or import it from a device (such
as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which we
use for things like helping users and others find people they
may know and for the other purposes listed below.
Users' usage. We collect information about how users use our
Products, such as the types of content they view or engage
with; the features they use; the actions they take; the people
or accounts they interact with; and the time, frequency and
duration of their activities. For example, we log when users
are using and have last used our Products, and what posts,
videos and other content users view on our Products. We also
collect information about how users use features like our
camera.
Information about transactions made on our Products. If
users use our Products for purchases or other financial
transactions (such as when they make a purchase in a game or
make a donation), we collect information about the purchase or
transaction. This includes payment information, such as their
credit or debit card number and other card information; other
account and authentication information; and billing, shipping
and contact details.
Things others do and information they provide about users.
We also receive and analyze content, communications and
information that other people provide when they use our
Products. This can include information about users, such as
when others share or comment on a photo of them, send a message
to them, or upload, sync or import their contact information.
Device Information
As described below, we collect information from and about
the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected
devices users use that integrate with our Products, and we
combine this information across different devices users use.
For example, we use information collected about users' use of
our Products on their phone to better personalize the content
(including ads) or features they see when they use our Products
on another device, such as their laptop or tablet, or to
measure whether they took an action in response to an ad we
showed them on their phone on a different device.
Information we obtain from these devices includes:
Device attributes: information such as the operating
system, hardware and software versions, battery level,
signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app
and file names and types, and plugins.
Device operations: information about operations and
behaviors performed on the device, such as whether a window
is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which
can help distinguish humans from bots).
Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other
identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts users
use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to
Facebook Company Products associated with the same device
or account).
Device signals: Bluetooth signals, and information
about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers.
Data from device settings: information users allow us
to receive through device settings they turn on, such as
access to their GPS location, camera, or photos.
Network and connections: information such as the name
of users' mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone,
mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in
some cases, information about other devices that are nearby
or on their network, so we can do things like help users
stream a video from their phone to their TV.
Cookie data: data from cookies stored on a user's
device, including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about
how we use cookies in the Facebook Cookies Policy (https://
www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/) and Instagram Cookies
Policy (https://www.instagram.com/legal/cookies/)
Information from partners.
Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us
information through Facebook Business Tools they use, including
our social plug-ins (such as the Like button), Facebook Login,
our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook pixel. These partners
provide information about users' activities off Facebook--
including information about their device, websites they visit,
purchases they make, the ads they see, and how they use their
services--whether or not they have a Facebook account or are
logged into Facebook. For example, a game developer could use
our API to tell us what games a user plays, or a business could
tell us about a purchase a user made in its store. We also
receive information about users' online and offline actions and
purchases from third-party data providers who have the rights
to provide us with users' information.
Partners receive users' data when users visit or use their
services or through third parties they work with. We require
each of these partners to have lawful rights to collect, use
and share users' data before providing any data to us.
Question 77. Yes or no: Does Facebook give non-Facebook users a
reasonable opportunity to learn what information has been collected
about them by Facebook? If yes, please describe how.
Answer. Yes. If a person doesn't have a Facebook account but
believes Facebook may have information about them, they can contact us
to request a copy of their information. A contact form is available at
https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/180237885820953.
However, Facebook does not create profiles about or track web or
app browser behavior of non-users.
Question 78. During the April 10, 2018 joint committee hearing, you
stated, ``Every piece of content that you share on Facebook, you own
and you have complete control over who sees it and--and how you share
it, and you can remove it at any time.'' To corroborate that statement,
you cited multiple mechanisms provided by Facebook that allow users to
locate, edit, download, and delete information collected about them by
Facebook.
(a) Yes or no: Does Facebook offer non-Facebook users the same
opportunities to control and edit any data collected about them by
Facebook?
Answer. A user owns the information they share on Facebook. This
means they decide what they share and who they share it with on
Facebook, and they can change their mind. We believe everyone deserves
good privacy controls. We require websites and apps who use our tools
to tell users they're collecting and sharing their information with us,
and to get users' permission to do so. However, non-Facebook users
cannot post content on Facebook. Accordingly, there are not
corresponding controls for non-Facebook users.
(b) Facebook's ``Privacy Basics'' on deleting posts states ``Hiding
lets you keep your post but no one else will be able to see it when
they view your Timeline. Note that it might still show up in search
results and other places on Facebook.''
(i) How does an individual have ``complete control'' over their
data if a post that has been hidden still shows up ``in search results
and other places on Facebook?''
Answer. A user can delete any post they have made. If they do so,
it will not appear in search results and in other places on Facebook.
The language you refer to appears in a feature that allows people to
hide--not delete--content from their personal timeline. That is, a
person can choose to delete a post that they have made from Facebook
entirely, or they can choose to hide a post from their timeline even
though it may be visible in other places on Facebook.
(ii) Does Facebook give users an opportunity delete their content
or information from these ``other places'' or search results?
Answer. Yes. See Response to Question 78(b)(i).
(iii) Does Facebook give non-users an opportunity to delete content
containing or relating to them from these ``other places'' or search
results?
Answer. Since this passage refers to content created by Facebook
users and whether it's visible on their timeline, this does not apply
to non-users. See the responses to the sub-questions above and below.
(c) If a Facebook user deletes a post will it show up in search
results and other places on Facebook? If so, please describe the other
places on Facebook in which a deleted post may appear.
Answer. In general, when a user deletes their account, we delete
things they have posted, such as their photos and status updates, and
they won't be able to recover that information later. (Information that
others have shared about them isn't part of their account and won't be
deleted.)
There are some limited exceptions to these policies: For instance,
information can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when
it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental
investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or
policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from
accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent
repeat abuse or other term violations.
(d) If a Facebook user deletes his account, will any of his data
show up in search results and other places on Facebook?
Answer. See Response to Question 78(c).
(i) Will Facebook retain any of his data for any purpose? If so,
please describe what data and for what purposes.
Answer. See Response to Question 78(c).
Question 79. Yes or no: does Facebook employ facial-recognition
technology?
(a) If so, does Facebook collect user data using facial-recognition
technology?
(b) If so, does Facebook collect data on individuals who are not
registered Facebook users using facial-recognition technology?
(c) If yes, does Facebook allow third-parties access to its facial-
recognition technology or related information obtained as a result of
the technology?
(d) If yes, does Facebook allow government entities access to its
facial recognition technology and/or the information obtained as a
result of the technology?
(e) To the extent that Facebook uses facial-recognition technology,
what policies and procedures does Facebook have to safeguard
information and data collected using that technology?
(f) Does Facebook offer individuals, whether registered users or
not, any opportunity to not be subject to facial-recognition technology
or to have data collected using facial-recognition technology deleted?
(g) Yes or no: Will Facebook commit to not using its facial-
recognition technology to assemble data on individuals who have never
consented to being part of Facebook?
Answer. Facebook uses facial recognition technology to provide
people with products and features that enhance online experiences for
Facebook users while giving them control over this technology.
Facebook's facial recognition technology helps people tag their friends
in photos; gives people an easier and faster way to privately share
their photos with friends; helps people with visual impairments by
generating descriptions of photos that people using screen readers can
hear as they browse Facebook; lets people know when a photo or video of
them has been uploaded to Facebook, even if they are not tagged; and
helps prevent people from impersonating other Facebook users.
Facial recognition technology uses machine-learning algorithms to
analyze the pixels in photos and videos in which a user is tagged, and
the photo used by the person as his or her profile picture, and
generates a unique number called a template. When a photo or video is
uploaded to Facebook, Facebook uses the template to attempt to identify
someone by determining whether there are any faces in that content, and
analyzing the portion of the image in which the face appears to compare
it against certain Facebook users depending on the purpose for which
facial recognition is being performed.
Facebook has not shared and does not have plans to share or make
available to any third party its facial recognition templates.
Moreover, these templates do not provide meaningful information on
their own; they can be used to identify a person only in conjunction
with Facebook's software. They could not be reverse-engineered to
recreate someone's face.
Facebook designed its facial-recognition technology and the
applications that use it with privacy considerations in mind and
incorporated various safeguards and controls that protect both (1)
users' ability to control the collection, use, and disclosure of their
personal information, and (2) the security of that personal
information.
Facebook gives users control over whether Facebook uses facial
recognition to recognize them in photos and videos. That control is
exercised through users' privacy settings. If a user chooses to turn
facial recognition off, Facebook does not create a template for that
person or deletes any template it has previously created. Facebook will
then be unable to recognize that person in any photos or videos that
are uploaded to the service. Facebook also deletes templates of people
who delete their Facebook accounts. Additionally, Facebook does not
maintain templates for users who have no photos tagged of themselves
and do not have a profile photo that is capable of being used to
generate a face signature or template (e.g., where a user has no
profile photo, where a user's profile photo does not contain a human
face, or where a user's profile photo contains multiple untagged
faces).
We inform people about our use of facial-recognition technology
through the Data Policy, Help Center, posts on Facebook, and direct
user notifications. Facebook users are told that they can opt out of
facial recognition at any time--in which case Facebook will delete
their template and will no longer use facial recognition to identify
them.
In creating facial recognition templates, Facebook uses only data
that people have voluntarily provided to Facebook: the photos and
videos that people have voluntarily uploaded to Facebook (including
public profile pictures) and the tags people have applied to those
photos and videos. Facebook does not use facial recognition to identify
someone to a stranger.
Question 80. Yes or no: does Facebook collect users' audio or
visual information for any reason whatsoever, or otherwise activate,
monitor, or capture data from a microphone or camera from a user's
phone without the user's contemporaneous knowledge and express,
contemporaneous consent? If so, please list each and every instance
under which Facebook does so.
Answer. No, Facebook does not engage in these practices or capture
data from a microphone or camera without consent. Of course, we do
allow people to take videos on their devices and share those on our
platform.
Question 81. Will Facebook commit to not using its platform to
gather such audio or visual information surreptitiously?
Answer. See Response to Question 80.
Question 82. During the April 11, 2018 House Energy and Commerce
Hearing, you stated, ``there may be specific things about how you use
Facebook, even if you're not logged in, that we keep track of, to make
sure that people aren't abusing the systems.'' You further stated that
``in general, we collect data on people who have not signed up for
Facebook for security purposes.''
(a) What categories of data does Facebook collect about registered
users' activity on websites and mobile applications other than
Facebook?
(b) What categories of data does Facebook collect about individuals
who are not registered Facebook users and their activity on websites
and mobile applications other than Facebook?
(c) To the extent Facebook collects such data, does Facebook sell
or provide this data to third parties?
(d) To the extent Facebook collects such data, has Facebook gained
consent from those individuals to collect and use their personal data?
(e) To the extent Facebook gathers such data, what opportunity does
Facebook provide to individuals not using Facebook to know, correct, or
delete any information Facebook has gathered and retained about them?
Answer. See Response to Question 74.
When the individual is a Facebook user, we are also able to use
this information to personalize their experiences on Facebook, whether
or not they are logged out, but we will not target ads to users relying
on this information unless the user allows this in their privacy
settings. We do not sell or share this information with third-parties.
Question 83. Most of your answers to the questions you received on
April 10, 2018, and likely most of the answers to these questions for
the record, will depend on information that Facebook alone possesses.
(a) Why is/are Facebook's content-suggesting algorithm(s) secret?
(b) Why are Facebook's editorial decisions secret?
Answer. See Response to Question 74.
When the individual is a Facebook user, we are also able to use
this information to personalize their experiences on Facebook, whether
or not they are logged out, but we will not target ads to users relying
on this information unless the user allows this in their privacy
settings. We do not sell or share this information with third-parties.
Question 84. Numerous Americans receive all or a significant
portion of their news from Facebook, which, in turn, suggests that news
to them based on an algorithm that determines appropriate content based
on criteria known only to Facebook.
(a) To what extent will Facebook make public the criteria on which
this algorithm relies?
(b) To what extent will Facebook make public any changes that it
makes to this or similar algorithms?
Answer. Facebook is a distribution platform that reflects the
conversations already taking place in society. We want Facebook to be a
place where people can discover more news, information, and
perspectives, and we are working to build products that help.
As to the questions regarding ranking and algorithmic changes, see
Response to Question 47.
Question 85. Facebook conducts numerous social experiments on its
users, examining everything from the effects of Facebook on voter
turnout to the effects of Facebook on the mood of its users.
(a) Will Facebook commit to not experimenting on its users without
express, informed consent in advance?
(b) Will Facebook commit to making the results of any such
experiments known publicly?
(c) Will Facebook commit to not experimenting on human subjects at
all?
Answer. Facebook does research in a variety of fields, from systems
infrastructure to user experience to artificial intelligence to social
science. We do this work to understand what we should build and how we
should build it, with the goal of improving the products and services
we make available each day. We're committed to doing research to make
Facebook better, but we want to do it in the most responsible way.
In October 2014, we announced a new framework that covers both
internal work and research that might be published:
Guidelines: we've given researchers clearer guidelines. If
proposed work is focused on studying particular groups or
populations (such as people of a certain age) or if it relates
to content that may be considered deeply personal (such as
emotions) it will go through an enhanced review process before
research can begin. The guidelines also require further review
if the work involves a collaboration with someone in the
academic community.
Review: we've created a panel including our most senior
subject-area researchers, along with people from our
engineering, research, legal, privacy and policy teams, that
will review projects falling within these guidelines. This is
in addition to our existing privacy cross-functional review for
products and research.
Training: we've incorporated education on our research
practices into Facebook's six-week training program, called
bootcamp, that new engineers go through, as well as training
for others doing research. We'll also include a section on
research in the annual privacy and security training that is
required of everyone at Facebook.
Research website: our published academic research is now
available at a single location (https://research.facebook.com/)
and will be updated regularly.
We believe in research because it helps us build a better Facebook.
Like most companies today, our products are built based on extensive
research, experimentation and testing.
It's important to engage with the academic community and publish in
peer-reviewed journals, to share technology inventions and because
online services such as Facebook can help us understand more about how
the world works. We want to do this research in a way that honors the
trust users put in us by using Facebook every day. We will continue to
learn and improve as we work toward this goal.
Question 86. What, if any, procedures does Facebook employ to
verify the identities of individuals who purchase or employ data from
Facebook?
Answer. Facebook does not sell people's information to anyone, and
we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners
can use and disclose the data we provide.
Our Data Policy makes clear the circumstances in which we work with
third-party partners who help us provide and improve our Products or
who use Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes
it possible to operate our companies and provide free services to
people around the world.
Question 87. Research and reporting by NYU Professor of Marketing
Scott Galloway suggests that, combined, Facebook and Google (parent
company now known as Alphabet) are together worth approximately $1.3
trillion. He concludes that this figure exceeds the world's top five
advertising agencies (WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, IPG, and Dentsu) with
five major media companies (Disney, Time Warner, 21st Century Fox, CBS,
and Viacom) and still need to add five major communications companies
(AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Charter, and Dish) approach 90 percent of
Facebook and Google's combined worth.
(a) What business or product lines does Facebook consider itself to
be in?
(i) On what basis does Facebook make that determination?
(ii) Who does Facebook consider its major competitors in each
of these business or product lines?
(b) Of those business or product lines, what market share does
Facebook believe that it has?
(c) What other entities provide all of the services that Facebook
does in one place or platform, if any?
(d) What other entities provide any of the services that Facebook
does?
(e) What is the relevant product market for Facebook (the
platform)?
(f) What are the relevant product markets for each of Facebook's
products?
(g) What is the relevant geographic market for Facebook (the
platform)?
(h) What is the relevant geographic market for each of Facebook's
products?
(i) Given these relevant geographic and product markets, what is
Facebook's market share in each distinct market in which it operates?
(j) What procedures, tools, programs, or calculations does Facebook
use to ascertain its market position relevant to its five largest
competitors overall (if five exist)?
(k) What procedures, tools, programs, or calculations does Facebook
use to ascertain its market position relevant to its five largest
competitors in each product market (if five exist)?
Answer. In Silicon Valley and around the world, new social apps are
emerging all the time. The average American uses eight different apps
to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people. There
is a lot of choice, innovation, and activity in this space, with new
competitors arising all the time. Facebook's top priority and core
service is to build useful and engaging products that enable people to
connect, discover and share through mobile devices and personal
computers. Given its broad product offerings, Facebook faces numerous
competitors, competing to attract, engage, and retain users, to attract
and retain marketers, and to attract and retain developers who build
compelling mobile and web applications. For instance, if a user wants
to share a photo or video, they can choose between Facebook,
DailyMotion, Snapchat, YouTube, Flickr, Twitter, Vimeo, Google Photos,
and Pinterest, among many other services. Similarly, if a user is
looking to message someone, just to name a few, there's Apple's
iMessage, Telegram, Skype, Line, Viber, WeChat, Snapchat, and
LinkedIn--as well as the traditional text messaging services their
mobile phone carrier provides. Equally, companies also have more
options than ever when it comes to advertising--from billboards, print
and broadcast, to newer platforms like Facebook, Spotify, Twitter,
Google, YouTube, Amazon or Snapchat. Facebook represents a small part
(in fact, just 6 percent) of this $650 billion global advertising
ecosystem and much of that has been achieved by helping small
businesses--many of whom could never have previously afforded newspaper
or TV ads--to cost-effectively reach a wider audience.
Question 88. As you indicated in your testimony, Facebook's
business model relies on advertising to individuals, typically through
tailored advertisements. This means that Facebook has monetized access
to the information that those individuals have published on Facebook.
(a) To Facebook's best approximation, what is the total value of
all user information that Facebook has acquired or to which Facebook
has access?
Answer. Facebook generates substantially all of its revenue from
selling advertising placements to third parties. Our total revenue and
the percentage of which comes from third-party ads is below. This
information is from our SEC filings.
2017: 40,653,000,000 (98 percent from third party ads)
2016: 27,638,000,000 (97 percent from third party ads)
2015: 17,928,000,000 (95 percent from third party ads)
2014: 12,466,000,000 (92 percent from third party ads)
2013: 7,872,000,000 (89 percent from third party ads)
2012: 5,089,000,000 (84 percent from third party ads)
2011: 3,711,000,000 (85 percent from third party ads)
2010: 1,974,000,000 (95 percent from third party ads)
2009: 777,000,000
2008: 272,000,000
(b) How does Facebook categorize individual pieces of information
for purposes of monetizing that information? (For example, Facebook
acknowledges that if it is approached by a company selling ski
equipment, it will target ads to individuals who have expressed an
interest in skiing. We want to know in what ways Facebook organizes
this information.)
Answer. As explained in our Data Policy, we collect three basic
categories of data about people: (1) data about things people do and
share (and who they connect with) on our services, (2) data about the
devices people use to access our services, and (3) data we receive from
partners, including the websites and apps that use our business tools.
Our Data Policy provides more detail about each of the three
categories. Any person can see each of the specific interests we
maintain about them for advertising by visiting Ads Preferences, which
lets people see what interests we use to choose ads for them--and to
edit or delete these interests.
We use data from each of the categories described above to obtain
these interests and to personalize every aspect of our services, which
is the core value we offer and the thing that makes Facebook services
unique from other online experiences. This includes selecting and
ranking relevant content, including ads, posts, Page recommendations,
to cite but a few examples.
For example, we use the data people provide about their age and
gender to help advertisers show ads based on those demographics but
also to customize the pronouns on our site and deliver relevant
experiences to those users.
We use data about things people do on Facebook, such as the Pages
they like, to associate ``interests'' with their accounts, so we can
rank posts relating to those interests higher in NewsFeed, for example,
or enable advertisers to reach audiences--i.e., groups of people--that
share those interests. For example, if a person has liked Pages about
baseball, we might associate them with interests called ``baseball'' or
``sports.''
We use data from devices (such as location data) to help
advertisers reach people in particular areas. For example, if people
have shared their device locations with Facebook or checked into a
specific restaurant, we can show them organic posts from friends who
have been in that location or we can show them ads from an advertiser
that wants to promote its services in their area or from the
restaurant.
We also help advertisers reach people who have given the advertiser
their contact information or who have used the advertiser's website or
app. For example, advertisers can send us a hashed list of e-mail
addresses of people they would like to reach on Facebook. If we have
matching e-mail addresses, we can show those people ads from that
advertiser (although we cannot see the e-mail addresses which are sent
to us in hashed form, and these are deleted as soon as we complete the
match).
Again, for people who are new to Facebook, we may have minimal data
that we can use to personalize their experience, including their
NewsFeed, their recommendations and the content (organic and sponsored)
that they see. For people who have used our services for longer, we
likely have more data, but the amount of data will depend on the nature
of that use and how they have used our controls.
As noted above, in addition to general controls--such as Activity
Log--we provide controls that specifically govern the use of data for
ads. Through Ad Preferences, people see and control things like: (1)
their ``interests,'' which are keywords associated with a person based
on activities such liking Pages and clicking ads; (2) their
``behaviors'' (which we also call ``categories''), which generally
reflect how, when and where they connect to Facebook; and (3) the
advertisers that are currently showing them ads based on the person's
contact information, based on the person's previous use of the
advertiser's website or app, or based on a visit to the advertiser's
store. People also can choose whether we use information about their
activities on websites and apps off of Facebook to show them ads
through Facebook, and whether we can use their Facebook advertising
interests to show them ads off of Facebook. People's use of these
controls will, of course, affect the data we use to show them ads.
(c) What types of advertisements does Facebook categorically
prohibit?
Answer. Section 4 of our Advertising Policies list the types of ads
that we categorically prohibit. These include ads that violate
Community Standards, ads for illegal products and services, ads with
adult content, ads that are misleading or false, ads that include
profanity, and many more.
(d) What external controls restrict how Facebook monetizes, sells,
rents, or otherwise commercializes an individual's information? Please
include (separately) any laws that Facebook views as applicable, any
injunctions presently binding Facebook, any regulations directing how
Facebook may monetize information, and any publicly available,
independent audits of how Facebook monetizes information.
Answer. Facebook complies with all applicable laws. In addition, we
adhere to the commitments set forth in our Data Policy, which describes
how we collect and use data.
(e) What internal controls restrict how Facebook monetizes, sells,
rents, or otherwise commercializes an individual's information? Please
include (separately) any internal policies, statements of ethics or
principles, directives, guidelines, or prohibitions that Facebook
routinely applies in determining whether to use an individual's
personal information for commercial gain.
Answer. See Response to previous question.
Question 89. When an individual chooses to ``lock down'' or
otherwise publicly conceal his Facebook profile, does Facebook:
(a) Continue to use that individual's private information for
commercial gain? (This includes aggregating data as well as targeting
advertisements at that individual.)
(b) Continue to retain that individual's private information for
its own archives or records?
Answer. When people post on Facebook--whether in a status update or
by adding information to their profiles--the ability to input the
information is generally accompanied by an audience selector. This
audience selector allows the person to choose who will see that piece
of information on Facebook--whether they want to make the information
public, share it with friends, or keep it for ``Only Me.'' The tool
remembers the audience a user shared with the last time they posted
something and uses the same audience when the user shares again unless
they change it. This tool appears in multiple places, such as privacy
shortcuts and privacy settings. When a person makes a change to the
audience selector tool in one place, the change updates the tool
everywhere it appears. The audience selector also appears alongside
things a user has already shared, so it's clear who can see each post.
After a person shares a post, they have the option to change who it is
shared with.
The audience with which someone chooses to share their information
is independent of whether we use that information to personalize the
ads and other content we show them. Specifically, our Data Policy
explains that we may use any information that people share on Facebook
``to deliver our Products, including to personalize features and
content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories
and ads).'' However, people can use our Ad Preferences tool to see the
list of interests that we use to personalize their advertising. This
means that, for example, a person who is interested in cars can
continue to share that interest with their friends but tell us not to
assign them an interest in ads for ad targeting purposes.
Likewise, the audience of a post does not determine whether a post
is retained. Someone can choose to share a post with ``Only Me''
(meaning that they don't want anyone to see it but want to retain it in
their Facebook account). They may also choose to delete the information
entirely. When people choose to delete something they have shared on
Facebook, we remove it from the site. In most cases, this information
is permanently deleted from our servers; however, some things can only
be deleted when a user permanently deletes their account.
Question 90. What are Facebook's total advertising revenues for
each of the calendar years 2001 to 2018?
Answer. Our total revenue and the percentage of which comes from
third-party ads is below. This information is from our SEC filings.
2017: 40,653,000,000 (98 percent from third party ads)
2016: 27,638,000,000 (97 percent from third party ads)
2015: 17,928,000,000 (95 percent from third party ads)
2014: 12,466,000,000 (92 percent from third party ads)
2013: 7,872,000,000 (89 percent from third party ads)
2012: 5,089,000,000 (84 percent from third party ads)
2011: 3,711,000,000 (85 percent from third party ads)
2010: 1,974,000,000 (95 percent from third party ads)
2009: 777,000,000
2008: 272,000,000
(a) What are Facebook's online advertising revenues for each of the
calendar years 2001 to 2018?
(b) What are Facebook's five largest competitors for online
advertising in each year from 2001 to 2018?
(i) What were each of those competitors' advertising revenues
through each of those years?
(ii) How many of Facebook's executive staff previously worked
at each of those entities?
Answer. We expect that our competitors make their numbers available
in their SEC filings. And, like many industries across the private
sector, many people may work in multiple technology companies
throughout the course of their careers.
Question 91. Regardless of place of incorporation, does Facebook
consider itself an American company?
Answer. Yes, we're an American-based company where ninety percent
of our community are outside the U.S.
Question 92. When Facebook makes policy decisions, are American
citizens the company's top priority? If not, what is the company's top
priority when it comes to policy decisions?
Answer. We are proud to be a U.S.-based company that serves
billions of people around the world. While the majority of our
employees are located here in the United States, more than 80 percent
of the people who use Facebook are outside this country. We consider
the needs of all of our users when making policy decisions. Of course,
with headquarters in the U.S. and Ireland, we have particularly strong
relationships with policy makers in those regions. We regularly engage
with policy makers around the world, however, and work to take account
of regional policy concerns as we build our products and policies for a
global user base.
Question 93. Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram have all reportedly
been blocked or partially blocked from the People's Republic of China
(PRC) since 2009.
(a) Please describe the extent to which these services may be
accessed from within the territory of the PRC, including Hong Kong and
Macau, and describing in detail any geographical limits or limits on
the available content.
Answer. Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram are available in Hong
Kong and Macau. Facebook and Instagram are blocked in Mainland China.
However, these can be accessed by people in Mainland China who employ
VPNs. WhatsApp is typically available in Mainland China although we
notice availability is often restricted around important events.
(b) On what basis does Facebook evaluate whether to honor a foreign
government's request to block specific content?
Answer. When something on Facebook or Instagram is reported to us
as violating local law, but doesn't go against our Community Standards,
we may restrict the content's availability only in the country where it
is alleged to be illegal after careful legal review. We receive reports
from governments and courts, as well from non-government entities such
as members of the Facebook community and NGOs.
(c) How does Facebook determine whether to honor a foreign
government's request to block specific content or users?
Answer. See Response to previous question.
(d) Listed by country, what percentage of requests to block
specific content (or users) from foreign governments does Facebook
honor in whole or part?
Answer. This information is available here: https://
transparency.facebook.com/content-restrictions.
(e) How does Facebook determine whether to honor the U.S.
Government's request to block specific content or users?
Answer. Our Transparency Report contains data on restrictions we
place on content that does not violate community standards but that is
alleged to violate local law. We do not have any such reports for the
United States.
(f) What percentage of requests to block specific content (or
users) from the U.S. Government does Facebook honor in whole or part?
Answer. See Response to previous question.
Question 94. Yes or no: Has Facebook made any alterations,
modifications, or changes to the encryption security of WhatsApp in
response to or as a result of the PRC government or any of its agencies
or in order to comply with PRC law?
Answer. No.
(a) If so, what changes has Facebook made to the encryption
security?
(b) Does Facebook program in ``back doors'' or other mechanisms to
decrypt or otherwise decode encrypted information at a government's
request?
Answer. No.
(i) If so, under what circumstances does Facebook decrypt such
data?
(ii) If so, on what platforms does Facebook have such
protocols?
(c) Does Facebook make WhatsApp or Facebook information available
to the PRC government on a searchable basis?
Answer. No.
Question 95. Since 2014, the PRC government has held a World
Internet Conference. Charles Smith, the co-founder of the non-profit
censorship monitoring website GreatFire, described foreign guests of
the Conference as ``complicit actors in the Chinese censorship regime
[that] are lending legitimacy to Lu Wei, the Cyberspace Administration
of China and their heavy-handed approach to Internet governance. They
are, in effect, helping to put all Chinese who stand for their
constitutional right to free speech behind bars.''
(a) How many Facebook employees have attended the PRC's World
Internet Conference?
(b) Have any Facebook employees ever participated on any panels or
advisory committees that are held or have been established by the World
Internet Conference?
Answer. There have been four World Internet Conferences. Several
Facebook employees have attended one or more of these four conferences.
(i) If so, please list the employees and the panels or high-level
advisory committees they have participated on.
Answer. One Facebook representative, Vaughan Smith, has
participated in World Internet Conference panels and keynotes alongside
representatives of other leading U.S. technology companies, for example
Tim Cook and Sundar Pichai. No employees participated in advisory
committees. Mr. Smith has provided keynotes on AI, innovation and how
Facebook is building the knowledge economy.
(ii) Has Facebook assisted other countries in designing regimes to
monitor or censor Facebook content? If so, which countries, and under
what circumstances? Please describe each.
Answer. When something on Facebook or Instagram is reported to us
as violating local law, but doesn't go against our Community Standards,
we may restrict the content's availability only in the country where it
is alleged to be illegal after careful legal review. We receive reports
from governments and courts, as well from non-government entities such
as members of the Facebook community and NGOs. This information is
available here: https://transparency.facebook.com/content-restrictions.
Government criticism does not violate our community standards, and
we do not evaluate or categorize accounts based on whether they engage
in government criticism.
See also Response to Question 93(c).
(c) Has Facebook ever provided any financial support to the World
Internet Conference? If yes, please provide and itemize all financial
support that has been provided to the World Internet Conference.
Answer. Facebook has not paid to participate in the World Internet
Conference. In 2016 we paid $10,000 to rent exhibit space at the event
to showcase Oculus VR which is manufactured in China.
Question 96. Has Facebook ever temporarily shut down or limited
access to Facebook, WhatsApp, or Instagram within a country or a
specific geographic area, at the request of a foreign government or
agency, including but not limited to, the PRC, the Islamic Republic of
Iran, Syria, the Russian Federation, and Turkey?
(a) If so, please describe each instance Facebook has complied with
a foreign government's request to censor content or users, the
requesting government, the provided justification for the government
request, and a description of the content requested to be removed.
(b) Please describe what if any policies Facebook has in place
governing Facebook's responses to government censorship requests.
Answer. We do not block access to Facebook products and services in
areas where they are otherwise generally available on the basis of
specific government requests. We may independently limit access to
certain functionality--such as peer-to-peer payments or facial
recognition--in some jurisdictions based on legal and regulatory
requirements.
In some instances, we may receive requests from governments or
other parties to remove content that does not violate our Community
Standards but is alleged to contravene local law. When we receive such
requests, we conduct a careful review to confirm whether the report is
legally valid and is consistent with international norms, as well as
assess the impact of our response on the availability of other speech.
When we comply with a request, we restrict the content only within the
relevant jurisdiction. We publish details of content restrictions made
pursuant to local law, as well as details of our process for handling
these requests, in our Transparency Report (https://
transparency.facebook.com/content-restrictions).

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Deb Fischer to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. Given ongoing user privacy concerns, American consumers
are asking for a public dialogue about the purposes for which Facebook
uses their personal data. However, a meaningful conversation cannot
happen until users also understand the sources from which their data is
gleaned, and the scope of the specific data--which characteristics,
attributes, labels, or categories of data points--being collected and
utilized. How many categories (i.e., attributes, factors, labels, or
data points) does Facebook collect about particular users?
Answer. As explained in our Data Policy, we collect three basic
categories of data about people:
(1)
data about things people do and share (and who they connect
with) on our services;
(2)
data about the devices people use to access our services; and
(3)
data we receive from partners, including the websites and apps
that use our business tools.
As far as the amount of data we collect about people, the answer
depends on the person. People who have only recently signed up for
Facebook have usually shared only a few things--such as name, contact
information, age, and gender. Over time, as people use our products, we
receive more data from them, and this data helps us provide more
relevant content and services. That data will fall into the categories
noted above, but the specific data we receive will, in large part,
depend on how the person chooses to use Facebook. For example, some
people use Facebook to share photos, so we receive and store photos for
those people. Some people enjoy watching videos on Facebook; when they
do, we receive information about the video they watched, and we can use
that information to help show other videos in their News Feeds. Other
people seldom or never watch videos, so we do not receive the same kind
of information from them, and their News Feeds are likely to feature
fewer videos.
The data we have about people also depends on how they have used
our controls. For example, people who share photos can easily delete
those photos. The same is true of any other kind of content that people
post on our services. Through Facebook's Activity Log tool, people can
also control the information about their engagement--i.e., their likes,
shares and comments--with other people's posts. The use of these
controls of course affects the data we have about people.
We recently announced improvements to our Download Your Information
tool, as well as a new feature that makes it easier for people to see
the information that's in their account on Facebook. These recently-
expanded tools for accessing your information will allow people to see
their data, delete it, and easily download and export it.
Question 2. How many categories, as the term is described above,
are used to construct the digital profiles that Facebook utilizes to
direct ads to particular users?
Answer. The specific number of categories that are used to decide
what ads a person will see vary from person to person, depending on the
interests and information that they have shared on Facebook, how
frequently they interact with ads and other content on Facebook, and
other factors. Any person can see each of the specific interests we
maintain about them for advertising by visiting Ads Preferences, which
lets people see what interests we use to choose ads for them--and to
edit or delete these interests. We also provide more detailed
information about how we use data to decide what ads to show to people
in our ``About Facebook Ads'' page, at https://www.facebook.com/ads/
about.
We use data about things people do on Facebook, such as the Pages
they like, to associate ``interests'' with their accounts, and we
enable advertisers to reach audiences--i.e., groups of people--that
share those interests. For example, if a person has liked Pages about
baseball, we might associate them with interests called ``baseball'' or
``sports.''
We use data from devices (such as location data) to help
advertisers reach people in particular areas. For example, if people
have shared their device locations with Facebook or checked into a
specific restaurant, we can show them ads from an advertiser that wants
to promote its services in their area or from the restaurant.
We also help advertisers reach people who have given the advertiser
their contact information or who have used the advertiser's website or
app. For example, advertisers can send us a hashed list of e-mail
addresses of people they would like to reach on Facebook. If we have
matching e-mail addresses, we can show those people ads from that
advertiser (although we cannot see the e-mail addresses which are sent
to us in hashed form, and these are deleted as soon as we complete the
match). The data we use to show ads to people depends on the data we
have received from people. Again, for people who are new to Facebook,
we may have minimal data that we can use. For people who have used our
services for longer, we likely have more data, but the amount of data
will depend on the nature of that use and how they have used our
controls.
As noted above, in addition to general controls--such as Activity
Log--we provide controls that specifically govern the use of data for
ads. Through Ad Preferences, people see and control things like: (1)
their ``interests,'' which are keywords associated with a person based
on activities such as liking Pages and clicking ads; (2) their
``behaviors'' (which we also call ``categories''), which generally
reflect how, when and where they connect to Facebook; and (3) the
advertisers that are currently showing them ads based on the person's
contact information, based on the person's previous use of the
advertiser's website or app, or based on a visit to the advertiser's
store. People also can choose whether we use information about their
activities on websites and apps off of Facebook to show them ads
through Facebook, and whether we can use their Facebook advertising
interests to show them ads off of Facebook. People's use of these
controls will, of course, affect the data we use to show them ads.
Question 3. If a user opts out of directed advertising, does
Facebook halt collection of all such data?
Answer. We give people a number of controls over the data we use to
show them ads. These controls apply to our use of data to show people
ads; they do not apply to the collection of data, because the same core
data sets are used to ensure the safety and security of our platform
and to provide our core service to our users. As noted above, people
can see and control the advertising ``interests'' and ``behaviors'' we
have associated with their accounts to show them ads. They can choose
not to see ads from a particular advertiser or not to see ads based on
their use of third-party websites and apps. They also can choose not to
see ads off Facebook that are based on the interests we derive from
their activities on Facebook.
Question 4. If a user opts out of directed advertising, does
Facebook delete all such data that was previously stored?
Alternatively, does Facebook instead simply stop utilization of that
data for directed advertising purposes?
Answer. Our advertising controls apply only to the use of data for
targeting and selecting ads. Using these controls does not result in
deletion of data, because the same core data sets are used to ensure
the safety and security of our platform and to provide our core service
to our users. This is consistent with industry practice. For example,
the Digital Advertising Alliance's Self-Regulatory Principles set the
industry standard for the collection and use of data for online
behavioral advertising and related practices. Those principles require
companies to offer controls over the use of data for advertising
purposes. Companies are not required to stop collecting data from
opted-out users or to delete previously collected data. Please note,
however, that when a person removes an ``interest'' or ``behavior'' in
Ad Preferences, that interest or behavior is permanently removed from
the person's ad profile; it will not be recreated even if the person
subsequently engages in activities that otherwise would have resulted
in the creation of the interest or behavior.
Question 5. When users download a copy of their Facebook data, as
Facebook has recently enabled, is all ad targeting data included in
that file?
Answer. Our Download Your Information or ``DYI'' tool is Facebook's
data portability tool and was launched many years ago to let people
access many types of information that we maintain about them, with a
focus on those types that a person may wish to use on another online
service. The data in DYI includes each of the demographic and
interests-based attributes we use to show or target people ads.
Although we do not store this data within DYI, people can also use Ad
Preferences to see which advertisers are currently running ads based on
their use of an advertiser's website or app. People also can choose not
to see ads from those advertisers.
We are also launching Access Your Information, a screenshot of
which was included in our April 27, 2018 letter to you. This is a
secure way for people to access and manage their information. Users can
go here to delete anything from their timeline or profile that they no
longer want on Facebook. They can also see their ad interests, as well
as information about ads they've clicked on and advertisers who have
provided us with information about them that influence the ads they
see. From here, they can go to their ad settings to manage how this
data is used to show them ads.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Jerry Moran to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. Cambridge Analytica had access to data on up to 87
million Facebook users because 270,000 individuals participated in a
personality quiz that also exposed their friends' data. While I
understand how the 270,000 individuals could have given their express
consent, can you please walk me through how the many millions of
friends could have given their ``affirmative express consent'' for
their data to be shared with a third party as is required by the 2011
consent decree--when they were unaware that a friend of theirs was even
participating in a personality quiz?
Answer. At the outset, we do not know what data Kogan may have
shared with Cambridge Analytica. Our investigation into these matters
is ongoing, and we are paused on investigating Cambridge Analytica
directly (or conducting a forensic audit of its systems) due to the
request of the UK Information Commissioner's Office, which is
separately investigating Cambridge Analytica, a UK entity. The best
information to date also suggests only U.S. user data was shared by
Kogan with Cambridge Analytica.
As was the practice of other online or mobile app platforms, at
that time, people on Facebook were able to take their data and data
their friends had shared with them off of Facebook to apps they
authorized to obtain a broader range of experiences than were available
on Facebook. But people could not share data for friends whose privacy
settings did not permit their data to be shared by their friends with
apps--and no data was shared with Kogan's app in violation of friends'
settings. The 2011 consent decree requires Facebook to get affirmative
express consent for materially expanding the audience of a user's
existing privacy settings. No privacy settings were expanded or
exceeded on Platform, and the consent order therefore does not apply
here.
Approximately 300,000 Facebook users worldwide installed Kogan's
app. For the majority of these users, the app requested consent to
access the following data fields associated with the user and with the
friends of the user: Public profile data, including name and gender;
Birthdate; ``Current city'' in the ``About'' section of the user's
profile, if provided; and Facebook Pages liked.
For a small subset of users, it appears that the app also requested
consent to access users' Facebook messages (fewer than 1,500
individuals, based on current information) and to posts that appeared
in the user's News Feed or Timeline (approximately 100 individuals,
based on current information)--but only for users who installed the
app. For a small subset of users (fewer than 1,500 individuals, based
on current information), it appears that the app also requested consent
to access the hometowns that the users' friends had specified in the
``About'' section of their profiles. And for a handful of people (fewer
than 10) who appear to be associated with Kogan/GSR, the app requested
consent to e-mail address and photos.
Question 2. According to Facebook's March 21 press release, one of
the six changes that Facebook initially offered to ``crack down on
platform abuse'' was to reward outside parties who find vulnerabilities
through its bug bounty program. My subcommittee has held hearings and
met with interested stakeholders on these types of data security
solutions along with other cyber vulnerability disclosure programs. One
concern I have regarding the utility of this approach is that
vulnerability disclosure programs are normally geared to identify
unauthorized access to data, not point out data sharing arrangements
that likely harm users but technically abide by the complex consent
agreements Facebook pushes on their users. Could you please explain how
Facebook's expansion of its bug bounty program will prevent future data
sharing issues with its associated applications from occurring?
Answer. The Data Abuse Bounty will reward people with first-hand
knowledge and proof of cases where a Facebook platform app collects and
transfers people's data to another party to be sold, stolen or used for
scams or political influence. We'll review all legitimate reports and
respond as quickly as possible when we identify a credible threat to
people's information. If we confirm data abuse, we will shut down the
offending app and, if necessary, take legal action against the company
selling or buying the data. We'll pay a bounty to the person who
reported the issue, or allow them to donate their bounty to a charity,
and we'll also alert those we believe to be affected. We also encourage
our users to report to us content that they find concerning or that
results in a bad experience, as well as other content that may violate
our policies. We review these reports and take action on abuse, like
removing content and disabling accounts.
Question 3. Facebook has confirmed alterations to its terms and
conditions shifting more than 1.5 billion of its user from contracts
with the international headquarters in Ireland to Facebook Inc. in the
United States, thereby removing these users from the protections they
would otherwise receive from the Europeans Union's General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR). With the recent scrutiny that Facebook
has faced about its data collection, sharing, and security polices what
is the justification for moving approximately 1.5 billion Facebook user
away from the more stringent rules of the European Union's GDPR?
Answer. We will offer everyone who uses Facebook the same controls
and settings, no matter where they live. However, the GDPR creates some
specific requirements that do not apply in the rest of the world, for
example the requirement to provide contact information for the EU Data
Protection Officer or to specify legal bases for processing data. We
are also looking to be more responsive to regional norms and legal
frameworks going forward, and want to have the flexibility to work with
local regulators, which is possible with this new model. At the same
time, we are changing the provisions in our Facebook, Inc. terms in our
user agreements outside the United States to allow people in other
countries to file lawsuits against Facebook in their home country,
rather than in courts in the U.S. This transition was part of a
continued effort to be locally responsive in countries where people use
our services.
Question 4. During your testimony, you noted that Facebook
cooperates with law enforcement in two instances, where there is an
``imminent threat of harm'' or when law enforcement reaches out to the
company with a ``valid request for data.'' In December 2017, the
Chicago Police Department announced that it had arrested fifty people
who were utilizing Facebook private group features in order to
communicate and facilitate illegal firearm and drug transactions.
Several national news outlets reported that Facebook was not helpful in
regards to this investigation and Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie
Johnson was later quoted in response to media inquiries as saying
``Quite frankly, they haven't been very friendly to law enforcement to
prevent these things.'' What specific policies and procedures does
Facebook currently have in place to aid law enforcement agencies in
gaining access to relevant information that indicates a clear threat to
public safety?
Answer. We recognize there are serious and evolving threats to
public safety and that law enforcement has an important responsibility
to keep people safe. Our legal and safety teams work hard to respond to
legitimate law enforcement requests while fulfilling our responsibility
to protect people's privacy and security. We have a global team that
strives to respond within minutes to emergency requests from law
enforcement. In the second half of 2017, for example, we provided
information in response to nearly 78 percent of the 1,808 requests for
emergency disclosures that we received from U.S. law enforcement
agencies. Facebook also reaches out to law enforcement whenever we see
a credible threat of imminent harm. We use automated and manual review
and also rely on users to help by reporting violating accounts or
content. We are also working with law enforcement and others to improve
our ability to find users at risk of harming themselves or others. We
also disclose information in response to law enforcement requests in
accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. In the second
half of 2017, for example, we disclosed data in response to 85 percent
of law enforcement requests from agencies in the U.S. Facebook
regularly produces a report on government requests to help people
understand the nature and extent of these requests and the policies and
processes in place to handle them.
In addition, we cooperated with the Chicago Police Department's
investigation that led to the December 2017 arrests. We reached out
immediately after we learned of the comments referenced in your
question, and they issued follow-up statements indicating that we
reached out and were planning to provide training. We followed up by
training over 100 Chicago-area law enforcement officers in a working
group hosted by the FBI and U.S. Attorney's Office. We also met
separately with the Chicago Police unit that conducted the
investigation to make sure they understood Facebook's policies, how to
submit requests to us, and how we could help them through additional
training and support.
Question 5. What specifically qualifies as a ``valid request for
data,'' which is required to gain access to information?''
Answer. We disclose account records in accordance with our terms of
service and applicable law, including the Federal Stored Communications
Act. In the United States, a valid subpoena issued in connection with
an official criminal investigation is required to compel the disclosure
of basic subscriber records. A court order issued under 18 U.S.C.
Sec. 2703(d) is required to compel the disclosure of certain records or
other information pertaining to the account, not including contents of
communications. A search warrant issued under the procedures described
in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure or equivalent state warrant
procedures upon a showing of probable cause is required to compel the
disclosure of the stored contents of any account. Facebook may also
voluntarily disclose information to law enforcement where we have a
good faith reason to believe that the matter involves imminent risk of
serious physical injury or death.
Question 6. How does Facebook determine what rises to an imminent
threat of harm and does that determination change the threshold for
deciding whether to respond to a law enforcement data request?
Answer. Facebook discloses account records in accordance with our
terms of service and applicable law, including the Federal Stored
Communications Act. The law permits Facebook to voluntarily disclose
information to law enforcement where we have a good faith reason to
believe that the matter involves imminent risk of serious physical
injury or death. Our law enforcement response team receives and
responds to emergency data requests around the clock and from around
the globe based on our timely and careful review of information
submitted by law enforcement and any other relevant facts. We also rely
on experience and input from law enforcement, safety organizations, and
industry to identify and respond to potential threats of harm.
Question 7. Facebook has made a big deal about users' ability to
request and download the data that Facebook has compiled about the
user. But that downloaded data does not include data such as the list
of the websites Facebook users have visited that is collected by
Facebook. Why is that the case, and when will Facebook make this
information available to users? What other information about Facebook
users is not available for download?
Answer. Our Download Your Information or ``DYI'' tool is Facebook's
data portability tool and was launched many years ago to let people
access and download many types of information that we maintain about
them. The data in DYI and in our Ads Preferences tool contain each of
the interest categories that are used to show people ads, along with
information about the advertisers are currently running ads based on
their use of an advertiser's website or app. People also can choose not
to see ads from those advertisers. We recently announced expansions to
Download Your Information, which, among other things, will make it
easier for people to see their data, delete it, and easily download and
export it. More information is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/
news/2018/04/new-privacy-protections.
Responding to feedback that we should do more to provide
information about websites and apps that send us information when
people use them, we also announced plans to build Clear History. This
new feature will enable users to see the websites and apps that send us
information when they use them, delete this information from their
account, and turn off Facebook's ability to store it associated with
their account going forward.
We have also introduced Access Your Information. This feature
provides a new way for people to access and manage their information.
Users can go here to delete anything from their timeline or profile
that they no longer want on Facebook. They can also see their ad
interests, as well as information about ads they've clicked on and
advertisers who have provided us with information about them that
influence the ads they see. From here, they can go to their ad settings
to manage how this data is used to show them ads.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. In the hearing, the topics of anticompetitive
consolidation and the enormous market capitalization of tech companies
such as Facebook were frequently raised. Recent calculations value the
four largest tech companies' capitalization at $2.8 trillion dollars,
which is a staggering 24 percent of the S&P 500 Top 50, close to the
value of every stock traded on the Nasdaq in 2001, and to give a
different perspective, approximately the same amount as France's
current GDP. At what point, from an antitrust perspective, is Facebook
simply too big? Would you say that your size inhibits the ``next
Facebook''?
Answer. In Silicon Valley and around the world, new social apps are
emerging all the time. The average American uses eight different apps
to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people. There
is a lot of choice, innovation, and activity in this space, with new
competitors arising all the time. Facebook's top priority and core
service is to build useful and engaging products that enable people to
connect, discover and share through mobile devices and personal
computers. Given its broad product offerings, Facebook faces numerous
competitors, competing to attract, engage, and retain users, to attract
and retain marketers, and to attract and retain developers who build
compelling mobile and web applications. For instance, if you want to
share a photo or video, you can choose between Facebook, DailyMotion,
Snapchat, YouTube, Flickr, Twitter, Vimeo, Google Photos and Pinterest
among many other services. Similarly, if you are looking to message
someone, just to name a few, there's Apple's iMessage, Telegram, Skype,
Line, Viber, WeChat, Snapchat and LinkedIn--as well as the traditional
text messaging services your mobile phone carrier provides. Equally,
companies also have more options than ever when it comes to
advertising--from billboards, print and broadcast, to newer platforms
like Facebook, Spotify, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Amazon, or Snapchat.
Facebook represents a small part (in fact, just 6 percent) of this $650
billion global advertising ecosystem and much of that has been achieved
by helping small businesses--many of whom could never have previously
afforded newspaper or TV ads--to cost-effectively reach a wider
audience.
Question 2. Senator Peters asked if Facebook extracts audio from
its users to enhance personal data profiles, to which you responded
no--is that the case? There are countless anecdotes about this exact
situation. Would you characterize these as coincidence or is targeted
advertising just that effective?
Answer. To be crystal clear on this point: Facebook does not use
users' phone's microphone or any other method to extract audio to
inform ads or to determine what they see in their News Feed. Facebook
show ads based on people's interests and other profile information--not
what users are talking out loud about. Facebook only accesses users'
microphone if the user has given our app permission and if they are
actively using a specific feature that requires audio (like voice
messaging features).
Question 3. As you are aware, children are increasingly active
users of technology. Do you have concerns generally about children's
increased use, in many cases that rises to the level of addiction, of
electronics? And more specifically, since I'm very interested in the
issue of individual privacy rights, what are your thoughts on the data
footprint of children being collected?
Answer. We take the privacy, safety, and security of all those who
use our platform very seriously and when it comes to minors (13 to 18
years old), we provide special protections and resources.
We also provide special protections for teens on Facebook and
Messenger. We provide education before allowing teens to post publicly.
We don't show search results based on specific profile data (high
school, birthday/age, and hometown, or current city) of teens to
unconnected adults when the adults search on Facebook. Unconnected
adults can't message minors who are 13-17. We prohibit search engines
off Facebook from indexing minors' profiles. And, we have age limits
for advertisements. For example, ads for dating sites, financial
services and other products or services are gated to users under 18.
We provide special resources to help ensure that they enjoy a safe
and secure experience. For example, we recently announced the launch of
our Youth Portal, which is available in 60 languages at facebook.com/
safety/youth. This portal is a central place for teens that includes:
Education: Information on how to get the most out of
products like Pages, Groups, Events, and Profile, while staying
safe. Plus, information on the types of data Facebook collects
and how we use it.
Peer Voices: First person accounts from teens around the
world about how they are using technology in new and creative
ways.
Ways to control your experience: Tips on things like
security, reporting content, and deciding who can see what
teens share.
Advice: Guidelines for how to safely get the most out of the
internet.
Instagram also will be providing information to teens to show them
where they can learn about all of the tools on Instagram to manage
their privacy and stay safe online, including how to use the new Access
and Download tools to understand what they have shared online and learn
how to delete things they no longer want to share. We are also making
this information available in formats specifically designed for young
users, including video tutorials for our privacy and safety tools, and
teen-friendly FAQs about the Instagram Terms of Use, Data Policy,
safety features, and Community Guidelines.
Instagram has also launched new content on Instagram Together,
including videos and FAQs about privacy controls; information on how to
use safety features, including comment controls, blocking accounts,
reporting abuse, spam, or troubling messages; information on
responsible social media use; and FAQs about safety on Instagram. We
will be reaching out to users under 18 on Instagram to encourage them
to learn more on Instagram Together.
Further, we have content restrictions and reporting features for
everyone, including minors. We have Community Standards that prohibit
hate speech, bullying, intimidation, and other kinds of harmful
behavior. We encourage people to report posts and rely on our team of
content reviewers around the world to review reported content. Our
reviewers are trained to look for violations and enforce our policies
consistently and as objectively as possible. When reviewed by our team,
we hide certain graphic content from users under 18 (and include a
warning for adults). We are also working to improve our ability to get
our community help in real time, especially in instances where someone
is expressing thoughts of suicide or self-harm, by expanding our use of
proactive detection, working with safety experts and first-responders,
and dedicating more reviewers from our Community Operations team.
In addition, with 9 out of 10 children under the age of 13 in the
United States able to access a tablet or smartphone and 2 out of 3 with
their own device, and parents seeking greater control over who connects
with their children, the content they see and the time they spend
online, we are committed to working with parents and families, as well
as experts in child development, online safety and children's health
and media, to ensure we are building better products for families.
That is why we're committed to both continued research and to
building tools that promote meaningful interactions and help people
manage their time on our platform.
Indeed, as we built Messenger Kids, we worked closely with leading
child development experts, educators, and parents to inform our
decisions. Our advisors include experts in the fields of child
development, online safety, and children's media currently and formerly
from organizations such as the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence,
Connect Safely, Center on Media and Child Health, Sesame Workshop and
more. The app does not have ads or in app purchase and we recently
added Sleep Mode which gives the parent the ability to set parameters
on when the app can be used. Messenger Kids collects only a limited
amount of information. Additionally, when a Messenger Kids user turns
13, which the minimum age to join Facebook, they don't automatically
get a Facebook account.
We recently launched a Parents Portal and Youth Portal, which are
both focused on fostering conversations around online safety and giving
parents and young people access to the information and resources they
need to make informed decisions about their use of online technologies.
Question 4. I'm very proud to be a cosponsor of the recently passed
SESTA legislation, which as you know, takes serious steps to hold
websites and other institutions accountable that knowingly facilitate
sex trafficking activity by closing loopholes in what was outdated
Federal communications law. As an active participant in the
deliberations and negotiations throughout the process, I noticed that
while Facebook ultimately supported the legislation, that was a stance
that evolved significantly- can you explain Facebook's shifting views
on this bill?
Answer. Facebook supports SESTA. We support the goal of the
legislation of providing victims of sex trafficking with recourse in
the courts against parties who directly support these illegal
activities, but wanted to ensure that good actors were not penalized
for their efforts to root out this type of harm online. We were very
pleased to be able to work successfully with a bipartisan group of
Senators on a bill that protects women and children from the harms of
sex trafficking.
Facebook is committed to making our platform a safe place,
especially for individuals who may be vulnerable. We have a long
history of working successfully with governments to address a wide
variety of threats to our platform, including child exploitation. When
we learn of a situation involving physical abuse, child exploitation,
or an imminent threat of harm to a person, we immediately report the
situation to first responders or the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children (NCMEC).
Further, as part of official investigations, government officials
sometimes request data about people who use Facebook. We have processes
in place to handle these government requests, and we disclose account
records in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. We
also have a global team that strives to respond within minutes to
emergency requests from law enforcement.
Our relationship with NCMEC also extends to an effort that we
launched in 2015 to send AMBER Alerts to the Facebook community to help
find missing children. When police determine that a case qualifies for
an AMBER Alert, the alert is issued by the NCMEC and distributed
through the Facebook system with any available information, including a
photograph of the missing child, a license plate number, and the names
and descriptions of the child and suspected abductor. Law enforcement
determines the range of the target area for each alert. We know the
chances of finding a missing child increase when more people are on the
lookout, especially in the critical first hours. Our goal is to help
get these alerts out quickly to the people who are in the best position
to help, and a number of missing children have been found through AMBER
Alerts on Facebook.
Further, we work tirelessly to identify and report child
exploitation images (CEI) to appropriate authorities. We identify CEI
through a combination of automated and manual review. On the automated
review side, we use image hashing to identify known CEI. On the manual
review side, we provide in-depth training to content reviewers on how
to identify possible CEI. Confirmed CEI is reported to the NCMEC, which
then forwards this information to appropriate authorities. When we
report content to the NCMEC, we preserve account information in
accordance with applicable law, which can help further law enforcement
investigations. We also reach out to law enforcement authorities in
serious cases to ensure that our reports are received and acted upon.
Question 5. Were your terms of service for third party app
developers violated by Cambridge Analytica? If not, have they ever been
violated in the past and what were those situations and outcomes?
Answer. Cambridge Analytica signed certifications at our insistence
declaring that they had deleted all copies of Facebook data and
derivatives obtained from Kogan's app. In March 2018, we received
reports that, contrary to the certification and confirmation we were
given by SCL/Cambridge Analytica, not all data was deleted. We are
moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these claims. If true,
this is an unacceptable violation of trust and a breach of the
representations Cambridge Analytica made in the certifications.
Question 6. Can a user opt-out of Facebook collecting and compiling
a user's web browsing history? If so, please provide the details
regarding how a user opts out of this collection.
Answer. The Ad Preferences tool on Facebook shows people the
advertisers whose ads the user might be seeing because they visited the
advertisers' sites or apps. The person can remove any of these
advertisers to stop seeing their ads.
In addition, the person can opt out of these types of ads
entirely--so he or she never sees those ads on Facebook based on
information we have received from other websites and apps.
We've also announced plans to build Clear History, a feature that
will enable people to see the websites and apps that send us
information when they use them, delete this information from their
accounts, and turn off our ability to store it associated with their
accounts going forward.
Apps and websites that use features such as the Like button or
Facebook Analytics send us information to make their content and ads
better. We also use this information to make user experience on
Facebook better. If a user clears his or her history or uses the new
setting, we'll remove identifying information so a history of the
websites and apps the user used won't be associated with the user's
account. We'll still provide apps and websites with aggregated
analytics--for example, we can build reports when we're sent this
information so we can tell developers if their apps are more popular
with men or women in a certain age group. We can do this without
storing the information in a way that's associated with the user's
account, and as always, we don't tell advertisers who users are.
It will take a few months to build Clear History. We'll work with
privacy advocates, academics, policymakers, and regulators to get their
input on our approach, including how we plan to remove identifying
information and the rare cases where we need information for security
purposes. We've already started a series of roundtables in cities
around the world and heard specific demands for controls like these at
a session we held at our headquarters. We're looking forward to doing
more.
Question 7. Finally, since you've recently spent some time in
Alaska, I'm sure your travels gave you a sense for our ardent
individualism and general skepticism about the benefits of conceding
privacy in the name of security. How can my constituents be assured of
their security online? Or more generally, what would you say should be
their new expectation of privacy online?
Answer. We believe that everyone has the right to expect strong
protections for their information, and that we also need to do our part
to help keep our community safe, in a way that's consistent with
people's privacy expectations. We've recently announced several steps
to give people more control over their privacy, including a new Privacy
Shortcuts tool that we're rolling out now to give people information
about how to control their information, including choosing who can see
what they post and adding protections like two-factor authentication to
their account. People can learn more about how to protect their privacy
in our updated Data Policy and in our Privacy Basics feature (https://
www.facebook.com/about/basics).

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Bill Nelson to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. While the primary focus of the April 10 hearing was on
Cambridge Analytica and Facebook's privacy and data security policies,
concerns were heard about many other issues from Members on both sides
of the aisle. Within this context, please detail specific steps that
Facebook is taking to address: (1) ``fake news'', (2) foreign
government interference in American elections, (3) illegal sex
trafficking, and (4) copyright infringement of digital content.
Answer. Fake News: We are working hard to stop the spread of false
news. We work with third party fact checking organizations to limit the
spread of articles with rated false. To reduce the spread of false
news, we remove fake accounts and disrupt economic incentives for
traffickers of misinformation. We also use various signals, including
feedback from our community, to identify potential false news. In
countries where we have partnerships with independent third-party fact-
checkers, stories rated as false by those fact-checkers are shown lower
in News Feed. If Pages or domains repeatedly create or share
misinformation, we significantly reduce their distribution and remove
their advertising rights. We also want to empower people to decide for
themselves what to read, trust, and share. We promote news literacy and
work to inform people with more context. For example, if third-party
fact-checkers write articles about a news story, we show them
immediately below the story in the Related Articles unit. We also
notify people and Page Admins if they try to share a story, or have
shared one in the past, that's been determined to be false. In addition
to our own efforts, we're learning from academics, scaling our
partnerships with third-party fact-checkers and talking to other
organizations about how we can work together.
Foreign Interference: In the run-up to the 2016 elections, we were
focused on the kinds of cybersecurity attacks typically used by nation
states, for example phishing and malware attacks. And we were too slow
to spot this type of information operations interference. Since then,
we've made important changes to prevent bad actors from using
misinformation to undermine the democratic process. This will never be
a solved problem because we're up against determined, creative and
well-funded adversaries. But we are making steady progress. Here is a
list of the 10 most important changes we have made:
Ads transparency. Advertising should be transparent: users
should be able to see all the ads an advertiser is currently
running on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. We are taking
steps to help users assess the content they see on Facebook.
For example, for ads with political content, we've created an
archive that will hold ads with political content for seven
years--including for information about ad impressions and
spend, as well as demographic data such as age, gender, and
location. People in Canada and Ireland can already see all the
ads that a Page is running on Facebook--and we're launching
this globally in June. Further, advertisers will now need to
confirm their ID and location before being able to run any ads
with political content in the U.S. All ads with political
content will also clearly state who paid for them. We also want
to empower people to decide for themselves what to read, trust,
and share. We promote news literacy and work to inform people
with more context. For example, if third-party fact-checkers
write articles about a news immediately below the story in the
Related Articles unit. We also notify people and Page Admins if
they try to share a story, or have shared one in the past,
that's been determined to be false.
Verification and labeling. We are working hard to regain the
trust of our community. Success would consist of minimizing or
eliminating abuse of our platform and keeping our community
safe. We have a number of specific goals that we will use to
measure our progress in these efforts. First, we are increasing
the number of people working on safety and security at
Facebook, to 20,000. We have significantly expanded the number
of people who work specifically on election integrity,
including people who investigate this specific kind of abuse by
foreign actors. Those specialists find and remove more of these
actors. Second, we work to improve threat intelligence sharing
across our industry, including, we hope, by having other
companies join us in formalizing these efforts. This is a fight
against sophisticated actors, and our entire industry needs to
work together to respond quickly and effectively. Third, we are
bringing greater transparency to election ads on Facebook by
requiring more disclosure from people who want to run election
ads about who is paying for the ads and by making it possible
to see all of the ads that an advertiser is running, regardless
of the targeting. We believe that these efforts will help to
educate our community and to arm users, media, civil society,
and the government with information that will make it easier to
identify more sophisticated abuse to us and to law enforcement.
Updating targeting. We want ads on Facebook to be safe and
civil. We thoroughly review the targeting criteria advertisers
can use to ensure they are consistent with our principles. As a
result, we removed nearly one-third of the targeting segments
used by the IRA. We continue to allow some criteria that people
may find controversial. But we do see businesses marketing
things like historical books, documentaries or television shows
using them in legitimate ways.
Better technology. We have gotten increasingly better at
finding and disabling fake accounts. We're now at the point
that we block millions of fake accounts each day at the point
of creation before they do any harm. This is thanks to
improvements in machine learning and artificial intelligence,
which can proactively identify suspicious behavior at a scale
that was not possible before--without needing to look at the
content itself.
Action to tackle fake news. (see above).
Significant investments in security. We're doubling the
number of people working on safety and security from 10,000
last year to over 20,000 this year. We expect these investments
to impact our profitability. But the safety of people using
Facebook needs to come before profit.
Industry collaboration. In April, we joined 34 global tech
and security companies in signing a TechAccord pact to help
improve security for everyone.
Intelligence sharing with government. In the 2017 German
elections, we worked closely with the authorities there,
including the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).
This gave them a dedicated reporting channel for security
issues related to the Federal elections.
Tracking 40+ elections. In recent months, we've started to
deploy new tools and teams to proactively identify threats in
the run-up to specific elections. We first tested this effort
during the Alabama Senate election, and plan to continue these
efforts for elections around the globe, including the U.S.
midterms. Last year we used public service announcements to
help inform people about fake news in 21 separate countries,
including in advance of French, Kenyan and German elections.
Action against the Russia-based IRA. In April, we removed 70
Facebook and 65 Instagram accounts--as well as 138 Facebook
Pages--controlled by the IRA primarily targeted either at
people living in Russia or Russian-speakers around the world
including from neighboring countries like Azerbaijan,
Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. The IRA has repeatedly used complex
networks of inauthentic accounts to deceive and manipulate
people in the U.S., Europe, and Russia--and we don't want them
on Facebook anywhere in the world. We are taking steps to
enhance trust in the authenticity of activity on our platform,
including increasing ads transparency, implementing a more
robust ads review process, imposing tighter content
restrictions, and exploring how to add additional authenticity
safeguards. We also have improved information sharing about
these issues among our industry partners.
Copyright: Facebook takes intellectual property rights seriously
and believes they are important to promoting expression, creativity,
and innovation in our community. Facebook's Terms of Service do not
allow people to post content that violates someone else's intellectual
property rights, including copyright and trademark. We publish
information about the intellectual property reports we receive in our
bi-annual Transparency Report, which can be accessed at https://
transparency.facebook.com/
Sex trafficking: Facebook is committed to making our platform a
safe place, especially for individuals who may be vulnerable. We have a
long history of working successfully with governments to address a wide
variety of threats to our platform, including child exploitation.
When we learn of a situation involving physical abuse, child
exploitation, or an imminent threat of harm to a person, we immediately
report the situation to first responders or the National Center for
Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). Further, as part of official
investigations, government officials sometimes request data about
people who use Facebook. We have processes in place to handle these
government requests, and we disclose account records in accordance with
our terms of service and applicable law. We also have a global team
that strives to respond within minutes to emergency requests from law
enforcement.
Our relationship with NCMEC also extends to an effort that we
launched in 2015 to send AMBER Alerts to the Facebook community to help
find missing children. When police determine that a case qualifies for
an AMBER Alert, the alert is issued by the NCMEC and distributed
through the Facebook system with any available information, including a
photograph of the missing child, a license plate number, and the names
and descriptions of the child and suspected abductor. Law enforcement
determines the range of the target area for each alert. We know the
chances of finding a missing child increase when more people are on the
lookout, especially in the critical first hours. Our goal is to help
get these alerts out quickly to the people who are in the best position
to help, and a number of missing children have been found through AMBER
Alerts on Facebook.
Further, we work tirelessly to identify and report child
exploitation images (CEI) to appropriate authorities. We identify CEI
through a combination of automated and manual review. On the automated
review side, we use image hashing to identify known CEI. On the manual
review side, we provide in-depth training to content reviewers on how
to identify possible CEI. Confirmed CEI is reported to the NCMEC, which
then forwards this information to appropriate authorities. When we
report content to the NCMEC, we preserve account information in
accordance with applicable law, which can help further law enforcement
investigations. We also reach out to law enforcement authorities in
serious cases to ensure that our reports are received and acted upon.
Question 2. Some commentators worry that the Internet is dominated
by a few large platforms with little competition or accountability.
Facebook is obviously considered to be one of those key, dominant
platforms.
Please comment on how American laws should hold large
Internet platforms accountable when things go wrong?
What is Facebook's legal and ethical responsibility as an
Internet platform with billions of global users?
Answer. Our mission is to give people the power to build community
and bring the world closer together--a mission that is inherently
global and enhanced by a global scope. As the Internet becomes more
important in people's lives, the real question is about the right set
of regulations that should apply to all Internet services, regardless
of size. Across the board, we have a responsibility to not just build
tools, but to make sure that they're used in ways that are positive for
our users. It will take some time to work through all the changes we
need to make across the company, but Facebook is committed to getting
this right.
Question 3. If large Internet platforms compromise consumer privacy
and/or facilitate the theft of original content, what should be the
Federal Government's response? What should be the obligations of the
platforms?
Answer. We take intellectual property rights seriously at Facebook
and work closely with the motion picture industries and other rights
holders worldwide to help them protect their copyrights and other IP.
Our measures target potential piracy across our products, including
Facebook Live, and continue to be enhanced and expanded. These include
a global notice-and-takedown program, a comprehensive repeat infringer
policy, integration with the content recognition service Audible Magic,
and our proprietary video-and audio-matching technology called Rights
Manager. More information about these measures can be found in our
Intellectual Property Help Center, Transparency Report, and Rights
Manager website.
Question 4. In general, as reflected in the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR), the European Union (EU) is considered to require
stronger data and privacy protections than the United States. According
to press reports, Facebook will be moving 1.5 billion users outside of
the scope of the EU's GDPR. Please explicitly lay out how Facebook's
compliance with the GDPR will affect all Facebook users, including
American users. That is, to what extent will the GDPR's requirements
and protections extend to Americans and users outside Europe?
Answer. The press reports referred to in this question pertain to
the legal entity with which Facebook users contract when they use the
service, which changed in some jurisdictions as a part of the most
recent updates to our Terms of Service and Data Policy. This change did
not impact people who live in the United States, who contract with
Facebook, Inc. under both our new and old policies.
The substantive protections in our user agreements offered by
Facebook Ireland and Facebook, Inc. are the same. However, there are
certain aspects of our Facebook Ireland Data Policy that are specific
to legal requirements in the GDPR--such as the requirement that we
provide contact information for our EU Data Protection Officer (DPO) or
that we identify the ``legal bases'' we use for processing data under
the GDPR. Likewise, our Facebook Ireland terms and Data Policy address
the lawful basis for transferring data outside the EU, based on legal
instruments that are applicable only to the EU.
In any case, the controls and settings that Facebook is enabling as
part of GDPR are available to people around the world, including
settings for controlling our use of face recognition on Facebook and
for controlling our ability to use data we collect off Facebook Company
Products to target ads. We recently began providing direct notice of
these controls and our updated terms to people around the world
(including in the U.S.), allowing people to choose whether or not to
enable or disable these settings or to consent to our updated terms. We
provide the same tools for access, rectification, erasure, data
portability and others to people in the U.S. and rest of world that we
provide in Europe, and many of those tools (like our Download Your
Information tool, ad preferences tool, and Activity Log) have been
available globally for many years.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maria Cantwell to
Mark Zuckerberg
I understand that last week you announced your support for
legislation that would regulate political ads on Internet platforms. By
your own report, Facebook has removed 70 Facebook accounts, 138
Facebook Pages, and 65 Instagram accounts run by the Russian
government-connected troll farm and election interference group known
as the Internet Research Agency.
I want to explore the distinction between paid political ads and
the troll and bot activity deployed by Russia that was designed to
meddle with and influence U.S. elections.
Question 1. What tools do we have to address this going forward? If
we pass the Honest Ads Act, won't we still have a problem with bots and
trolls that aren't running traditional paid ``political ads''?
Answer. We have always believed that Facebook is a place for
authentic dialogue and that the best way to ensure authenticity is to
require people to use the names they are known by. Fake accounts
undermine this objective and are closely related to the creation and
spread of inauthentic communication such as spam and disinformation. We
also prohibit the use of automated means to access our platform. We
rely on both automated and manual review in our efforts to effectively
detect and deactivate fake accounts, including bots, and we are now
taking steps to strengthen both. For example, we continually update our
technical systems to identify, checkpoint, and remove inauthentic
accounts. We block millions of attempts to register fake accounts every
day. These systems examine thousands of detailed account attributes and
prioritize signals that are more difficult for bad actors to disguise.
Question 2. Do we need a new definition of paid advertising or
political expenditures that reaches bots and troll activity that are
backed by foreign national interests?
Answer. We're committed to addressing this, and we have a number of
efforts underway. Facebook has generally dealt with bots and troll
activity via its Authenticity policy. Already, we build and update
technical systems every day to better identify and remove inauthentic
accounts, which also helps reduce the distribution of material that can
be spread by accounts that violate our policies. Each day, we block
millions of fake accounts at registration. Our systems examine
thousands of account attributes and focus on detecting behaviors that
are very difficult for bad actors to fake, including their connections
to others on our platform. By constantly improving our techniques, we
also aim to reduce the incentives for bad actors who rely on
distribution to make their efforts worthwhile.
For example, the Internet Research Agency, based in St. Petersburg,
is a ``troll farm'' and generally thought to be aligned with the
Russian government. Facebook has determined that Internet Research
Agency users violated Facebook's authenticity policy and has been
working to remove them from the platform. This has resulted in the
removal of numerous Facebook and Instagram accounts, as well as the
content connected with those accounts. Facebook has found that many
trolls are motivated by financial incentives and is taking steps to
disrupt those incentives to discourage the behavior. While working to
limit the impact of bots and trolls, Facebook is striving to strike the
right balance between enabling free expression and ensuring that its
platform is safe. Facebook's policies are aimed at encouraging
expression and respectful dialogue.
Question 3. Would you commit to working on troll problem in a way
that does not compromise free speech?
Answer. Yes, see Response to Question 2.
Question 4. In your testimony you talked about your use of
artificial intelligence to combat hate speech, bots, and trolls. What
do you feel is the correct regulatory or other approach Congress should
take to address artificial intelligence or other emerging technologies?
Answer. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a very promising technology
that has many applications. Fairness, transparency and accountability
should guide its development. Presently, AI systems make decisions in
ways that people don't really understand. Thus, society needs to invest
further in developing AI systems which are more transparent. Facebook
has AI teams working on developing the philosophical, as well as
technical, foundations for this work. We discussed our AI ethics work
during the keynote of our recent developer's conference (at minute 47):
https://www.facebook.com/FacebookforDevelopers/videos/
10155609688618553/.
Question 5. How does Facebook plan to address the leveraging of its
social engineering tools developed to optimize advertising revenue by
state sponsored actors and geopolitical forces that seek to influence
democratic elections and political outcomes?
Answer. In the run-up to the 2016 elections, we were focused on the
kinds of cybersecurity attacks typically used by nation states, for
example phishing and malware attacks. And we were too slow to spot this
type of information operations interference. Since then, we've made
important changes to prevent bad actors from using misinformation to
undermine the democratic process.
This will never be a solved problem because we're up against
determined, creative and well-funded adversaries. But we are making
steady progress. Here is a list of the 10 most important changes we
have made:
1.
Ads transparency. Advertising should be transparent: users
should be able to see all the ads an advertiser is currently
running on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. And for ads with
political content, we've created an archive that will hold ads
with political content for seven years--including information
about ad impressions and spend, as well as demographic data
such as age, gender and location. People in Canada and Ireland
can already see all the ads that a Page is running on
Facebook--and we're launching this globally in June.
2.
Verification and labeling. Every advertiser will now need
confirm their ID and location before being able to run any ads
with political content in the U.S. All ads with political
content will also clearly state who paid for them.
3.
Updating targeting. We want ads on Facebook to be safe and
civil. We thoroughly review the targeting criteria advertisers
can use to ensure they are consistent with our principles. As a
result, we removed nearly one-third of the targeting segments
used by the IRA. We continue to allow some criteria that people
may find controversial. But we do see businesses marketing
things like historical books, documentaries or television shows
using them in legitimate ways.
4.
Better technology. Over the past year, we've gotten increasingly
better at finding and disabling fake accounts. We now block
millions of fake accounts each day as people try to create
them--and before they've done any harm. This is thanks to
improvements in machine learning and artificial intelligence,
which can proactively identify suspicious behavior at a scale
that was not possible before--without needing to look at the
content itself.
5.
Action to tackle fake news. We are working hard to stop the
spread of false news. We work with third party fact checking
organizations to limit the spread of articles with rated false.
To reduce the spread of false news, we remove fake accounts and
disrupt economic incentives for traffickers of misinformation.
We also use various signals, including feedback from our
community, to identify potential false news. In countries where
we have partnerships with independent third-party fact-
checkers, stories rated as false by those fact-checkers are
shown lower in News Feed. If Pages or domains repeatedly create
or share misinformation, we significantly reduce their
distribution and remove their advertising rights. We also want
to empower people to decide for themselves what to read, trust,
and share. We promote news literacy and work to inform people
with more context. For example, if third-party fact-checkers
write articles about a news story, we show them immediately
below the story in the Related Articles unit. We also notify
people and Page Admins if they try to share a story, or have
shared one in the past, that's been determined to be false. In
addition to our own efforts, we're learning from academics,
scaling our partnerships with third-party fact-checkers and
talking to other organizations about how we can work together.
A key focus is working to disrupt the economics of fake news. For
example, preventing the creation of fake accounts that spread
it, banning sites that engage in this behavior from using our
ad products, and demoting articles found to be false by fact
checkers in News Feed--causing it to lose 80 percent of its
traffic. We now work with independent fact checkers in the
U.S., France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Italy, Mexico,
Colombia, India, Indonesia and the Philippines with plans to
scale to more countries in the coming months.
6.
Significant investments in security. We're doubling the number
of people working on safety and security from 10,000 last year
to over 20,000 this year. We expect these investments to impact
our profitability. But the safety of people using Facebook
needs to come before profit.
7.
Industry collaboration. Recently, we joined 34 global tech and
security companies in signing a TechAccord pact to help improve
security for everyone.
8.
Information sharing and reporting channels. In the 2017 German
elections, we worked closely with the authorities there,
including the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).
This gave them a dedicated reporting channel for security
issues related to the Federal elections.
9.
Tracking 40+ elections. In recent months, we've started to
deploy new tools and teams to proactively identify threats in
the run-up to specific elections. We first tested this effort
during the Alabama Senate election, and plan to continue these
efforts for elections around the globe, including the U.S.
midterms. Last year we used public service announcements to
help inform people about fake news in 21 separate countries,
including in advance of French, Kenyan and German elections.
10.
Action against the Russia-based IRA. In April, we removed 70
Facebook and 65 Instagram accounts--as well as 138 Facebook
Pages--controlled by the IRA primarily targeted either at
people living in Russia or Russian-speakers around the world
including from neighboring countries like Azerbaijan,
Uzbekistan and Ukraine. The IRA has repeatedly used complex
networks of inauthentic accounts to deceive and manipulate
people in the U.S., Europe and Russia--and we don't want them
on Facebook anywhere in the world.
Question 6. How should Congress address the leveraging of social
engineering tools developed to optimize advertising revenue on
technology platforms, by state sponsored actors and geopolitical forces
that seek to influence democratic elections and political outcomes?
Answer. From its earliest days, Facebook has always been focused on
security. These efforts are continuous and involve regular contact with
law enforcement authorities in the U.S. and around the world. Elections
are particularly sensitive events for Facebook's security operations,
and as the role of Facebook's service plays in promoting political
dialogue and debate has grown, so has the attention of its security
team. To address these concerns, Facebook is taking steps to enhance
trust in the authenticity of activity on its platform, including
increasing ads transparency, implementing a more robust ads review
process, imposing tighter content restrictions, and exploring how to
add additional authenticity safeguards. We welcome a dialog with
government about how to address these societal issues.
Question 7. During the 2016 campaign, Cambridge Analytica worked
with the Trump campaign to refine tactics. Were Facebook employees
involved in that?
Answer. During the 2016 election cycle, Facebook worked with
campaigns to optimize their use of the platform, including helping them
understand various ad formats and providing other best practices
guidance on use of the platform.
______
Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Amy Klobuchar to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question. Do you support a rule that would require you to notify
your users of a breach within 72 hours?
Answer. Facebook is generally open to the idea of breach
notification requirements, particularly legislation that would
centralize reporting and ensure a consistent approach across the United
States. For example, in Europe, the GDPR requires notification to a
lead supervisory authority, rather than individual member states, in
cases of a data breach. In the United States, however, there is no
centralized notification scheme, and instead, reporting obligations
vary widely across all 50 states. This complexity makes it harder to
respond appropriately and swiftly to protect people in the event of a
data breach. We believe this is an important issue and an area that is
ripe for thoughtful regulation.
______
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Richard Blumenthal to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. Facebook's Download Your Information Tool: During the
hearing, I asked not only whether Facebook users should be able to
access their information, but specifically whether it would provide its
users ``all of the information that you collect as a result of
purchases from data brokers, as well as tracking them?'' You
affirmatively stated that Facebook has a ``Download Your Information
(DYI) tool that allows people to see and to take out all of the
information that they have put into Facebook or that Facebook knows
about them.''
However, in a March 7, 2018 correspondence provided to the U.K.
Parliament regarding Paul-Olivier Dehaye's legal request for personal
data, Facebook's Privacy Operations Team acknowledged that the DYI tool
does not provide records stored in its `Hive' database. This answer
appears to confirm that the Facebook `Pixel' web tracking system and
other records are stored and combined with profile information, but not
provided to users. Since then, WIRED magazine and academic researchers
have noted the omission from the DYI tool of other pieces of data that
Facebook is known to collect.
What specific pieces of data does Facebook collect that are not
provided through the DYI tool? Please provide exact labels and
descriptions of the types of data and its source, rather than broad
categories or intent, including but not limited to web tracking data,
location history, ad interactions and advertiser targeting data, third
party applications, and derived inferences.
Answer. Our Download Your Information or ``DYI'' tool is Facebook's
data portability tool and was launched many years ago to let people
access and download many types of information that we maintain about
them. The data in DYI and in our Ads Preferences tool contain each of
the interest categories that are used to show people ads, along with
information about the advertisers that are currently running ads based
on their use of an advertiser's website or app. People also can choose
not to see ads from those advertisers. We recently announced expansions
to Download Your Information, which, among other things, will make it
easier for people to see their data, delete it, and easily download and
export it. More information is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/
news/2018/04/new-privacy-protections/.
Responding to feedback that we should do more to provide
information about websites and apps that send us information when
people use them, we also announced plans to build Clear History. This
new feature will enable users to see the websites and apps that send us
information when they use them, delete this information from their
account, and turn off Facebook's ability to store it associated with
their account going forward.
We have also introduced Access Your Information. This feature
provides a new way for people to access and manage their information.
Users can go here to delete anything from their timeline or profile
that they no longer want on Facebook. They can also see their ad
interests, as well as information about ads they've clicked on and
advertisers who have provided us with information about them that
influence the ads they see. From here, they can go to their ad settings
to manage how this data is used to show them ads.
Question 2. Facebook's Web Tracking: While users can more readily
understand the types of data that Facebook collects directly from them,
Facebook's data collection practices regarding non-users and from other
sources are opaque. For example, Facebook collects data from its social
plugins, Pixel, and other similar properties (``web tracking data'')
that provide a deep understanding about an individual's web browsing
habits.
Would an employee with appropriate technical permissions to the
Hive database be able to generate a list of websites viewed by a
Facebook user, where such websites contained a Facebook tracking
property?
Answer. We have strict policy controls and technical restrictions
so employees only access the data they need to do their jobs--for
example to fix bugs, manage customer support issues or respond to valid
legal requests. Employees who abuse these controls will be fired.
Further information is available in our Cookies Policy, available at
http://facebook.com/ads/about.
Question 3. Is web tracking data used for inferring an individual's
interests or other characteristics? Are those inferences used in
advertising?
Answer. Yes, but only for Facebook users. We do not use web
browsing data to show ads to non-users or otherwise store profiles
about non-users. Our goal is to show people content (including
advertising) that is relevant to their interests. We use information
people have provided on Facebook--such as things they've liked or posts
they've engaged with--to help determine what people will be interested
in. Like most online advertising companies, we also inform our
judgments about what ads to show based on apps and websites that people
use off of Facebook. People can turn off our use of web browser data
and other data from third-party partners to show them ads through a
control in Ads Preferences. They can also customize their advertising
experience by removing interests that they do not want to inform the
Facebook ads they see. In addition, a person's browser or device may
offer settings that allow users to choose whether browser cookies are
set and to delete them.
Question 4. Does Facebook provide users and non-users with the
ability to disable the collection (not merely the use) of web tracking?
Does Facebook allow users to delete this data without requiring the
deletion of their accounts?
Answer. When people visit apps or websites that feature our
technologies--like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers
automatically log (i) standard browser or app records of the fact that
a particular device or user visited the website or app (this connection
to Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a
website or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button,
and is an inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any
additional information the publisher of the app or website chooses to
share with Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as
the fact that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard
feature of the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same
information with multiple different third-parties whenever people visit
their website or app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's
website shares information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick
and with the analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a
person visits the Committee's website, it sends browser information
about their visit to each one of those third parties. More information
about how this works is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/
04/data-off-facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for this
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us--
described above--in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First,
these logs are critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to
detecting or preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser
has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign
the device might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a
potentially inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to
register for an account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide
summaries and insights to websites and apps about how many people visit
or use their product or use specific features like our Like button--but
without providing any information about a specific person.
We do not create profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use
browser and app logs for non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from
our advertisers to them or otherwise seek to personalize the content
they see. However, we may take the opportunity to show a general ad
that is unrelated to the attributes of the person or an ad encouraging
the non-user to sign up for Facebook.
When the individual is a Facebook user, we are also able to use
this information to personalize their experiences on Facebook, whether
or not they are logged out, but we will not target ads to users relying
on this information unless the user allows this in their privacy
settings. We do not sell or share this information with third-parties.
We recently announced plans to build on this by introducing Clear
History, a new feature that will enable users to see the websites and
apps that send us information when they use them, delete this
information from their accounts, and turn off our ability to store it
associated with their accounts going forward.
Question 5. One academic study from 2015 raised concerns about the
privacy risks of web tracking data collected from health-related web
pages, including an example of Facebook collecting information from the
inclusion of a Facebook Like button on the CDC's page about HIV. Does
Facebook impose any limitation on itself regarding the collection and
use (including references) of web tracking data collected from health-
related pages or any other themes of websites?
Answer. Websites and apps choose whether they use Facebook services
to make their content and ads more engaging and relevant and whether
they share browser data or other information with Facebook or other
companies when people visit their sites. These services include:
Social plugins, such as our Like and Share buttons, which
make other sites more social and help people share content on
Facebook;
Facebook Login, which lets people use their Facebook account
to log into another website or app;
Facebook Analytics, which helps websites and apps better
understand how people use their services; and
Facebook ads and measurement tools, which enable websites
and apps to show ads from Facebook advertisers, to run their
own ads on Facebook or elsewhere, and to understand the
effectiveness of their ads.
Many companies offer these types of services and, like Facebook,
they also get information from the apps and sites that use them.
Twitter, Pinterest, and LinkedIn all have similar Like and Share
buttons to help people share things on their services. Google has a
popular analytics service. And Amazon, Google, and Twitter all offer
login features. These companies--and many others--also offer
advertising services. In fact, most websites and apps send the same
information to multiple companies each time users visit them.
For example, when a user visits a website, their browser (for
example Chrome, Safari or Firefox) sends a request to the site's
server. The browser shares a user's IP address, so the website knows
where on the Internet to send the site content. The website also gets
information about the browser and operating system (for example Android
or Windows) they're using because not all browsers and devices support
the same features. It also gets cookies, which are identifiers that
websites use to know if a user has visited before.
A website typically sends two things back to a user's browser:
first, content from that site; and second, instructions for the browser
to send the user's request to the other companies providing content or
services on the site. So, when a website uses one of our services, our
users' browsers send the same kinds of information to Facebook as the
website receives. We also get information about which website or app
our users are using, which is necessary to know when to provide our
tools.
Our policies include a range of restrictions on the use of these
tools for health-related advertising. For example, we do not allow ads
that discriminate based on disability, medical or genetic condition.
Ads also may not contain content that directly or indirectly asserts or
implies a person's disability, medical condition (including physical or
mental health), or certain other traits. And ads generally may not
request health information, including physical health, mental health,
medical treatments, medical conditions, or disabilities. And we
prohibit anyone from using our pixel to send us data that includes
health, financial information, or other categories of sensitive
information.
In addition, we also enable ad targeting options--called
``interests'' and ``behaviors''--that are based on people's activities
on Facebook, and when, where, and how they connect to the Internet
(such as the kind of device they use and their mobile carrier). These
options do not reflect people's personal characteristics, but we still
take precautions to limit the potential for advertisers to misuse them.
For example, we do not create interest or behavior segments that
suggest the people in the segment are members of sensitive groups such
as people who have certain medical conditions.
Question 6. What changes, if any, is Facebook making to limit the
amount of data that Facebook itself collects about users and non-users?
Answer. As explained in our Data Policy, we collect three basic
categories of data about people: (1) data about things people do and
share (and who they connect with) on our services, (2) data about the
devices people use to access our services, and (3) data we receive from
partners, including the websites and apps that use our business tools.
Our Data Policy provides more detail about each of the three
categories.
We use this information for a variety of purposes, including to
provide, personalize, and improve our products, provide measurement,
analytics, and other business services, promote safety and security, to
communicate with people who use our services, and to research and
innovate to promote the social good. We provide more information in our
Data Policy about these uses as well.
Our policies limit our retention of the data that we receive in
several ways. Specifically, we store data until it is no longer
necessary to provide our services and Facebook products, or until a
person's account is deleted--whichever comes first. This is a case-by-
case determination that depends on things like the nature of the data,
why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational
retention needs. For example, when a user searches for something on
Facebook, they can access and delete that query from within their
search history at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after
6 months. If they submit a copy of their government-issued ID for
account verification purposes, we delete that copy 30 days after
submission. If a user posts something on their Facebook profile, then
that information would be retained until they delete it or until they
delete their account.
We also have other policies that are designed to limit our
retention of other types of information about people. For example, if a
user visits a site with the ``Like'' button or another social plugin,
we receive cookie information that we use to help show them a
personalized experience on that site as well as Facebook, to help
maintain and improve our service, and to protect both the user and
Facebook from malicious activity. We delete or anonymize it within 90
days.
In general, when a user deletes their account, we delete things
they have posted, such as their photos and status updates, and they
won't be able to recover that information later. (Information that
others have shared about them isn't part of their account and won't be
deleted.)
There are some limited exceptions to these policies: For instance,
information can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when
it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental
investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or
policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from
accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent
repeat abuse or other term violations.
We collect very little data about non-users (unless they choose to
communicate directly with us) and do not create profiles or track
browsing history for people who are not registered users of Facebook,
for example.
Particularly in the past few months, we've realized that we need to
take a broader view of our responsibility to our community. Part of
that effort is continuing our ongoing efforts to identify ways that we
can improve our privacy practices. This includes restricting the way
that developers can get information from Facebook and announcing plans
to build Clear History, a new feature that will enable users to see the
websites and apps that send us information when they use them, delete
this information from their accounts, and turn off our ability to store
it associated with their accounts going forward.
Question 7. Onavo Protect: When Facebook bought a VPN service,
Onavo Protect, the purchase was portrayed as a way for your company to
build more efficient mobile products. Since 2016, you have encouraged
users to install the Onavo application as a way to ``keep you and your
data safe,'' although it does not brand itself as a Facebook product.
Onavo is a particularly sensitive product since it provides your
company access to all of the Internet traffic being generated by the
device. Wall Street Journal and other publications have reported that
Facebook has used the data captured from the Onavo for market analytics
on competitive services.
Does Facebook use traffic information collected from Onavo to
monitor the adoption or popularity of non-Facebook applications?
Answer. When people first install the iOS version of the Onavo
Protect app, we explain that Onavo uses a VPN that ``helps keep you and
your data safe by understanding when you visit potentially malicious or
harmful websites and giving you a warning.'' In addition, the first
screen that a person sees when installing the app explains, under a
heading that reads ``Data Analysis'':
``When you use our VPN, we collect the info that is sent to,
and received from, your mobile device. This includes
information about: your device and its location, apps installed
on your device and how you use those apps, the websites you
visit, and the amount of data use.
This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by
analyzing your use of websites, apps and data. Because we're a
part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook
products and services, gain insights into the products and
services people value, and build better experiences.''
People must tap a button marked ``Accept & Continue'' after seeing
this information in a full-screen interstitial before they can use the
app.
The Android version of the Onavo Protect app offers data management
features (e.g., the ability to block apps from using background data)
that do not require users to enable the app's VPN.
For both versions of the app, we communicate repeatedly and up
front--in the App Store description, in Onavo's Privacy Policy, and in-
line at the time the user first opens the app after downloading it--
that Onavo is part of Facebook and what that means for how Onavo
Protect handles data in other ways.
More broadly, websites and apps have used market research services
for years. We use Onavo, App Annie, comScore, and publicly available
tools to help us understand the market and improve all our services.
When people download Onavo to manage their data usage and help secure
their connection, we are clear about the information we collect and how
it is used. Like other VPNs, when the Onavo VPN is enabled, Onavo
Protect helps create a secure connection, including when people are on
public Wi-Fi. As part of this process, Onavo receives their mobile data
traffic. This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service. Because
we're part of Facebook, we also use this information to improve
Facebook products and services. We let people know about this activity,
and other ways that Onavo uses, analyzes, and shares data (for example,
the apps installed on users' devices) in the App Store descriptions,
and when they first open the app after downloading it.
Facebook does not use Onavo data for Facebook product uses, nor
does it append any Onavo data or data about individuals' app usage to
Facebook accounts.
Question 8. Has Facebook ever used the Onavo data in decisions to
purchase another company or develop a product to compete against
another company?
Answer. See Response to Question 7.
Question 9. Does Facebook associate Onavo traffic information with
profile data from its social networking sites, including for analytic
purposes?
Answer. See Response to Question 7.
Question 10. Facebook and Academic Research: Facebook's users place
a significant amount of trust in the company to keep its data safe and
protect the integrity of the platform. While Facebook has now developed
a well-regarded ethical review processes and it is commendable that the
company has supported academic research, any process is fallible and at
least one of its experiments on ``emotional contagion'' was highly
criticized by the academic community. One of the researchers behind the
Cambridge Analytica application, Dr. Aleksandr Kogan, had frequently
collaborated with Facebook on social science research based on its
data, including a paper where Facebook provided data on every
friendship formed in 2011 in every country in the world at the national
aggregate level. Facebook users almost certainly are unaware that their
data is used for scientific research by outside researchers nor do they
have a credible understanding of the accountability of these
relationships.
Has Facebook ever provided any third party researcher with direct
access to non-anonymized user data?
Answer. In our Data Policy, we explain that we may use the
information we have to conduct and support research in areas that may
include general social welfare, technological advancement, public
interest, health, and well-being. Researchers are subject to strict
restrictions regarding data access and use as part of these
collaborations.
Question 11. Do users have the ability to opt out of such
experiments?
Answer. No, users do not have the ability to opt out of such
research; however, we disclose our work with academic researchers in
our Data Policy, and our work with academics is conducted subject to
strict privacy and research protocols.
Question 12. Has a researcher ever been found to have misused
access to the non-anonymized user data? Please describe any such
incidents.
Answer. We are investigating all apps that, like Aleksandr Kogan's,
had access to large amounts of information before we changed our
platform in 2014 to reduce data access. The investigation process is in
full swing, and it has two phases. First, a comprehensive review to
identify every app that had access to this amount of Facebook data. And
second, where we have concerns, we will conduct interviews, make
requests for information (RFI)--which ask a series of detailed
questions about the app and the data it has access to--and perform
audits that may include on-site inspections. We have large teams of
internal and external experts working hard to investigate these apps as
quickly as possible. To date thousands of apps have been investigated
and around 200 (from a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You, the
Cambridge Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality) have been
suspended--pending a thorough investigation into whether they did in
fact misuse any data. Where we find evidence that these or other apps
did misuse data, we will ban them and notify people whose data was
shared with these apps. Additionally, we have suspended an additional
14 apps, which were installed by around one thousand people. They were
all created after 2014, after we made changes to more tightly restrict
our platform APIs to prevent abuse. However, these apps appear to be
linked to AIQ, which was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica. So, we
have suspended them while we investigate further. Any app that refuses
to take part in or fails our audit will be banned.
Question 13. Does Facebook believe it would have a responsibility
to report such incidents der the consent decree? If such incidents have
occurred, has Facebook reported them to the FTC?
Answer. The July 27, 2012 Consent Order memorializes the agreement
between Facebook and the FTC and does not require ongoing reporting.
Instead, and among other things, the consent order obligates
Facebook not to misrepresent the extent to which it maintains the
privacy or security of covered information (Section I), not to
materially exceed the restrictions of a privacy setting that applies to
nonpublic user information without affirmative express consent (Section
II), and to implement a comprehensive privacy program that is subjected
to ongoing review by an independent assessor (Sections IV and V).
Facebook accurately represented the operation of its developer Platform
and the circumstances under which people could share data (including
friends data) with developers, honored the restrictions of all privacy
settings that covered developer access to data, and implemented a
comprehensive privacy program build on industry-leading controls and
principles, which has undergone ongoing review by an independent
assessor approved by the FTC.
Question 14. Cambridge Analytica Timeline Questions: There have
been conflicting reports regarding the timeline of Facebook's response
to the ``thisisyourdigitallife'' application developed for Cambridge
Analytica. Please provide specific information about Facebook's
response to the matter.
With respect to the harvesting of user data from the
``thisisyourdigitallife'' application, for each the following (a)
Cambridge Analytica, (b) Christopher Wylie, and (c) Dr. Kogan, on what
date did Facebook:
1.
First contact that party about the data collected from the
application?
2.
Seek certification that the partys copy of the data was
destroyed?
3.
Receive the certification from party?
Answer. On December 11, 2015, The Guardian published an article
reporting that Kogan and his company, GSR, may have passed information
the app had obtained from Facebook users to SCL Elections Ltd. (SCL)/
Cambridge Analytica. If this occurred, Kogan and his company violated
Facebook's Platform Policies, which explicitly prohibited selling user
data accessed from Facebook and from sharing any user data accessed
from Facebook with any ad network, data broker or other advertising or
monetization related service.
For this reason, Facebook immediately banned the app from our
platform and investigated what happened and what further action we
should take to enforce our Platform Policies. Facebook also contacted
Kogan/GSR and demanded that they explain what data they collected, how
they used it, and to whom they disclosed it. Facebook further insisted
that Kogan and GSR, as well as other persons or entities to whom they
had disclosed any such data, account for and irretrievably delete all
such data and information.
Facebook also contacted Cambridge Analytica to investigate the
allegations reflected in the reporting. On January 18, 2016, Cambridge
Analytica provided written confirmation to Facebook that it had deleted
the data received from Kogan and that its server did not have any
backups of that data. On June 11, 2016, Kogan executed and provided to
Facebook signed certifications of deletion on behalf of himself and
GSR. The certifications also purported to identify all of the
individuals and entities that had received data from GSR (in addition
to Kogan and his lab), listing the following: SCL, Eunoia Technologies
(a company founded by Christopher Wylie), and a researcher at the
Toronto Laboratory for Social Neuroscience at the University of
Toronto. On July 7, 2016, a representative of the University of Toronto
certified that it deleted any user data or user-derived data. On August
16, 2016, Eunoia (executed by Eunoia Founder Christopher Wylie)
certified that it deleted any user and user-derived data. On September
6, 2016, counsel for SCL informed counsel for Facebook that SCL had
permanently deleted all Facebook data and derivative data received from
GSR and that this data had not been transferred or sold to any other
entity. On April 3, 2017. Alexander Nix, on behalf of SCL, certified to
Facebook, that it deleted the information that it received from GSR or
Kogan.
Because all of these concerns relate to activity that took place
off of Facebook and its systems, we have no way to confirm whether
Cambridge Analytica may have Facebook data without conducting a
forensic audit of its systems. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to submit
to a forensic audit, but we have not commenced that yet due to a
request from the UK Information Commissioner's Office, which is
simultaneously investigating Cambridge Analytica (which is based in the
UK). And even with an audit, it may not be possible to determine
conclusively what data was shared with Cambridge Analytica or whether
it retained data after the date it certified that data had been
deleted.
The existing evidence that we are able to access supports the
conclusion that Kogan only provided SCL with data on Facebook users
from the United States. While the accounts of Kogan and SCL conflict in
some minor respects not relevant to this question, both have
consistently maintained that Kogan never provided SCL with any data for
Facebook users outside the United States. These consistent statements
are supported by a publicly released contract between Kogan's company
and SCL.
Question 15. Was Facebook aware at that time that Cambridge
Analytica had developed other platform applications to collect user
data? What applications did it delete due to associations with
Cambridge Analytica and when were they removed from the platform?
Answer. Our investigation of Cambridge Analytica's advertising
activities is ongoing, and we have banned Cambridge Analytica from
purchasing ads on our platform. Cambridge Analytica generally utilized
custom audiences, some of which were created from contact lists and
other identifiers that it generated and uploaded to our system to
identify the people it wanted to deliver ads to on Facebook, and in
some instances, refined those audiences with additional targeting
attributes.
Question 16. Facebook's ``People You May Know'' Feature: Facebook's
``People You May Know'' feature has drawn attention for disclosures
that reveal sensitive relationships, such as psychiatrists who have
reported that their clients were recommended to each other.
What pieces of data does Facebook use for the PYMK feature? Has it
ever used data collected from data brokers for this purpose?
Answer. People You May Know can help Facebook users find friends on
Facebook. People You May Know suggestions come from things such as
having friends in common, or mutual friends; being in the same Facebook
group or being tagged in the same photo; users' networks (for example,
school or work); and contacts users have uploaded. We give people
context when we suggest someone with mutual friends. Users may delete
contacts that they have uploaded to Facebook, in which case that
information is no longer used for People You May Know. Facebook does
not allow advertisers to target ads based o People You May Know.
Facebook does not use data collected from data brokers for PYMK.
Question 17. Has PYMK ever used location to make recommendations
and does it currently? If so, is this based on device reported
geolocation or IP address?
Answer. PYMK uses country-level location to help users find
friends.
Question 18. Does Facebook provide users with the ability to opt
out of data collected from them or data about them being used by PYMK?
Answer. See Response to Question 16.
Question 19. Has the PYMK feature ever bypassed the privacy
controls in order to perform its analytics for recommendations? For
example, if a user's friends list is set to private, will Facebook
still use this data to make recommendations to others?
Answer. See Response to Question 16.
Question 20. Other Cambridge Analyticas: Over a month ago, Mr.
Zuckerberg stated that one of Facebook's next responsibilities was to
``make sure that there aren't any other Cambridge Analyticas out
there.'' One would expect that review process would include identifying
past cases where Facebook identified or took action against third-party
developers over their data collection practices.
When the company Klout automatically created accounts and assigned
social popularity scores for the children of Facebook users, did
Facebook send a deletion letter or exercise its right to audit?
Answer. In 2011, Facebook contacted Klout regarding potential
violations of Facebook polices. Facebook determined that these issues
had been resolved by Dec. 2011.
We use a variety of tools to enforce Facebook policies against
violating parties, including developers. We review tens of thousands of
apps per year and regularly disapprove noncompliant apps as part of our
proactive review process. We also use tools like cease and desist
letters, account suspensions, letter agreements, and civil litigation.
For example, since 2006, Facebook has sent over 1,150 cease-and-desist
letters to over 1,600 targets. In 2017, we took action against about
370,000 apps, ranging from imposing certain restrictions to removal of
the app from the platform. Moreover, we have required parties who have
procured our data without authorization to delete that data. We have
invested significant resources in these efforts. Facebook is presently
investigating apps that had access to large amounts of information
before we changed our platform policies in 2014 to significantly reduce
the data apps could access. To date around 200 apps (from a handful of
developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You, the Cambridge Psychometrics Center,
and myPersonality) have been suspended--pending a thorough
investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data.
Additionally, we have suspended an additional 14 apps, which were
installed by around one thousand people. They were all created after
2014, after we made changes to more tightly restrict our platform APIs
to prevent abuse. However, these apps appear to be linked to AIQ, which
was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica. So, we have suspended them
while we investigate further. Any app that refuses to take part in or
fails our audit will be banned.
Question 21. How many times was Facebook made aware of privacy
breaches by applications?
Answer. Facebook's policies regarding third-party usage of its
platform technologies have prohibited--and continue to prohibit--those
third-party app developers from selling or licensing user data obtained
from Facebook and from sharing any user data obtained from Facebook
with any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-
related service. We will investigate all apps that had access to large
amounts of information before we changed our platform in 2014 to reduce
data access, and we will conduct a full audit of any app with
suspicious activity.
Question 22. How many times did Facebook send a deletion letter to
an application developer for strictly privacy violations?
Answer. We use a variety of tools to enforce Facebook policies
against violating parties, including developers. We review tens of
thousands of apps per year and regularly disapprove noncompliant apps
as part of our proactive review process. We also use tools like cease
and desist letters, account suspensions, letter agreements, and civil
litigation. For example, since 2006, Facebook has sent over 1,150
cease-and-desist letters to over 1,600 targets. In 2017, we took action
against about 370,000 apps, ranging from imposing certain restrictions
to removal of the app from the platform. Moreover, we have required
parties who have procured our data without authorization to delete that
data. We have invested significant resources in these efforts. Facebook
is presently investigating apps that had access to large amounts of
information before we changed our platform policies in 2014 to
significantly reduce the data apps could access. To date around 200
apps (from a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You, the Cambridge
Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality) have been suspended--pending a
thorough investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data.
Question 23. How many times did Facebook perform an audit on an
application for strictly privacy violations?
Answer. See Response to Question 22.
Question 24. How many times did Facebook initiate litigation for
strictly privacy violations?
Answer. See Response to Question 22.
Question 25. How many times did Facebook impose a moratorium or ban
on an application developer for strictly privacy violations?
Answer. See Response to Question 22.
Question 26. Does Facebook plan to provide public disclosure of
incidents where it finds that user data was improperly obtained or
transferred by third-party application developers?
Answer. We are in the process of investigating every app that had
access to a large amount of information before we changed our Platform
in 2014. The investigation process is in full swing, and it has two
phases. First, a comprehensive review to identify every app that had
access to this amount of Facebook data and to focus on apps that
present reason for deeper investigation. And second, where we have
concerns, we will conduct interviews, make requests for information
(RFI)--which ask a series of detailed questions about the app and the
data it has access to--and perform audits using expert firms that may
include on-site inspections. We have large teams of internal and
external experts working hard to investigate these apps as quickly as
possible. To date thousands of apps have been investigated and around
200 apps have been suspended--pending a thorough investigation into
whether they did in fact misuse any data. Where we find evidence that
these or other apps did misuse data, we will ban them and let people
know.
These apps relate to a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You,
the Cambridge Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality, with many of the
suspended apps being affiliated with the same entity. Many of these
suspensions include apps that appear to be ``test'' apps that were
never released to the public, and therefore would not have acquired
significant user data, although our investigation into these apps is
ongoing.
Additionally, we have suspended an additional 14 apps, which were
installed by around one thousand people. They were all created after
2014, after we made changes to more tightly restrict our platform APIs
to prevent abuse. However, these apps appear to be linked to AIQ, which
was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica. So, we have suspended them
while we investigate further. Any app that refuses to take part in or
fails our audit will be banned.
We will commit to briefing your staff on future developments.
Question 27. Facebook Privacy Settings: This month, Facebook began
to roll out changes to comply with new European data protection rules.
These updates include a new consent process that affects how Facebook
uses sensitive data and whether facial recognition is enabled, among
other factors.
Has Facebook engaged in user testing or other analysis that
assessed how platform changes and interface design influence the
adoption of certain privacy settings?
Answer. We routinely test new products and consent flows before
rolling them out broadly to ensure that there are no bugs or unintended
behaviors that would lead to an unintended or negative user experience.
In designing the GDPR roll out, like all product roll outs, we rely on
design principles and research derived from numerous sources, including
user research and academic research, to develop experiences that are
engaging and useful for the broadest number of people. We also
conducted cross-disciplinary workshops, called ``design jams,'' with
experts around the world to collect input on user interaction
principles that would inform our work. We have learned from our work
and other design research in the field that people are less likely to
make informed or thoughtful decisions when bombarded with many
different choices in succession. To avoid so-called ``notice fatigue,''
we streamlined the number of data choices people are presented with as
part of the GDPR roll out to 2-3 choices (depending on the user's
existing settings), responding to early testing of a version with
several additional choices, which the people who tested this version
did not like. We also used a layered approach that gave people the
information needed to make an informed choice on the first screen,
while enabling ready access to deeper layers of information and
settings for those interested in a particular topic. We will continue
to monitor how these and other privacy settings perform with users.
It's important to us that people have the information they need to make
the privacy choices that are right for them.
Question 28. Has Facebook ever tested platform changes and
interface design to determine whether it would lead to users allowing
more permissive privacy settings?
Answer. At Facebook, we make decisions about privacy through a
cross-functional, cross-disciplinary effort that involves participants
from departments across the company. This process is a collaborative
approach to privacy that seeks to promote strong privacy protections
and sound decision making at every stage of the product development
process. Our privacy program is responsible for reviewing product
launches, major changes, and privacy-related bug fixes to products and
features to ensure that privacy policies and procedures are
consistently applied and that key privacy decisions are implemented for
the product. This approach has several key benefits.
First, it is designed to consider privacy early in the product
development process. This allows us to consider the benefits that a
feature is intended to have for people who use our services, how data
will be used to deliver those benefits, and how we can build features
from the ground up that include privacy protections to enable those
benefits while protecting people's information and putting them in
control.
Second, while complying with our obligations is critically
important, taking a cross-disciplinary approach to privacy encourages
us to think about data protection as more than just a compliance
exercise. Instead, we evaluate how to design privacy into the features
that we build and consider this from the perspective of things like how
we design interfaces that make data use intuitive, taking a consistent
approach to privacy across our services, and building protections in
how our software is engineered. Accordingly, while we scale our privacy
review process depending on the complexity of a particular data use,
reviews typically involve experts who evaluate proposed data practices
from the perspective of multiple disciplines.
As part of our consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission,
we submit a report to the FTC every two years. That report is based on
assessments conducted by an independent third party on a bi-annual
basis, which require us to submit evidence to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the program.
Question 29. EU Data Protection Regulations: In Europe, under new
data protection regulations, Facebook will be required to provide users
will more clear opportunities to provide consent and afford more
protections to that data. While Facebook has stated that it will offer
some of those protections for users outside of Europe, it has not
committed to providing all of these protection. I am interested in what
rules Congress should put into place for such data.
Would Facebook support a requirement that users be provided with
clear and plain information about the use of their data?
Answer. Yes. We work hard to provide clear information to people
about how their information is used and how they can control it. We
agree that companies should provide clear and plain information about
their use of data and strive to do this in our Data Policy, in in-
product notices and education, and throughout our product--and we
continuously work on improving this. We provide the same information
about our data practices to users around the world and are required
under many existing laws--including U.S. laws (e.g., Section 5 of the
FTC Act) to describe our data practices in language that is fair and
accurate.
Question 30. Would Facebook support a requirement that users be
allowed to download and take their data to competitive services?
Answer. Facebook already allows users to download a copy of their
information from Facebook. This functionality, which we've offered for
many years, includes numerous categories of data, including About Me,
Account Status History, Apps, Chat, Follower, Following, Friends,
Messages, Networks, Notes, and more. We recently launched improvements
to our ``Download Your Information'' tool, including to give people
choices about whether they want to download only certain types of
information and about the format in which they want to receive the
download, to make it easier for people to use their information once
they've retrieved it.
Question 31. Would Facebook support a requirement that users are
assured that their data is actually deleted when they request its
deletion or close their account?
Answer. In general, when a user deletes their account, we delete
things they have posted, such as their photos and status updates, and
they won't be able to recover that information later. (Information that
others have shared about them isn't part of their account and won't be
deleted.)
There are some limited exceptions to these policies: For instance,
information can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when
it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental
investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or
policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from
accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent
repeat abuse or other term violations.
Question 32. Would Facebook support a requirement of mandatory and
timely disclosure of breaches?
Answer. Facebook is generally open to the idea of breach
notification requirements, particularly legislation that would
centralize reporting and ensure a consistent approach across the United
States. For example, in Europe, the GDPR requires notification to a
lead supervisory authority, rather than individual member states, in
cases of a data breach. In the United States, however, there is no
centralized notification scheme, and instead, reporting obligations
vary widely across all 50 states. This complexity makes it harder to
respond appropriately and swiftly to protect people in the event of a
data breach. We believe this is an important issue and an area that is
ripe for thoughtful regulation.
Question 33. Would Facebook support a requirement for a baseline
technical and organizational measures to ensure adequate data security?
Answer. Facebook is generally not opposed to regulation but wants
to ensure it is the right regulation. The issues facing the industry
are complex, multi-faceted, and affect an important part of peoples'
lives. As such, Facebook is absolutely committed to working with
regulators, like Congress, to craft the right regulations. Facebook
would be happy to review any proposed legislation and provide comments.
Question 34. Russian Interference: As early as June 2015, the New
York Times Magazine had documented the Internet Research Agency's
interest in interfering with American politics, and even named specific
Facebook accounts associated in the disinformation effort. The way that
Facebook is designed, outsiders have very little insight into these
efforts. And yet, the Russian media outlet RBC had identified accounts
that were paying to spread content several months before Facebook took
notice. New York Times also claims that as early as November 2016,
Facebook's Chief Security Officer Alex Stamos had uncovered evidence
that Russian operatives used the platform to weaponized information
obtained from the hacking of the DNC and the Clinton campaign.
In a CNN interview, Mr. Zuckerberg for the first time disclosed
that Facebook had found ``a lot of different accounts coming from
Macedonia'' to spread false news during the Alabama special election.
That election, another one decided by only small margin, was months
ago. Mr. Zuckerberg acknowledged that Facebook expects there will be
attempts to interfere in the midterm elections with newer tactics, a
belief shared by the intelligence community.
Will you commit to providing Congress with information about
disinformation and propaganda campaigns on a timely basis prior to the
midterm elections?
Answer. We recently outlined steps we are taking on election
integrity here: https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/03/hard-questions-
election-security/.
Further, pursuant to the new transparency measures Facebook is
launching, all advertisers who want to run ads with political content
targeted at the U.S. will have to confirm their identity and location
by providing either a U.S. driver's license or passport, last four
digits of their social security number, and a residential mailing
address. Ads that include political content and appear on Facebook or
Instagram will include a ``Paid for by'' disclaimer provided by the
advertisers that shows the name of the funding source for the ad.
Question 35. The New York Times reports details of Russian
interference were removed from the April 2017 report ``Information
Operations and Facebook'' by management due to political and business
reasons. Will Facebook provide Congress with the original draft of the
report?
Answer. In the run-up to the 2016 elections, we were focused on the
kinds of cybersecurity attacks typically used by nation states, for
example phishing and malware attacks. And we were too slow to spot this
type of information operations interference. Since then, we've made
important changes to prevent bad actors from using misinformation to
undermine the democratic process.
This will never be a solved problem because we're up against
determined, creative and well-funded adversaries. But we are making
steady progress. Here is a list of the 10 most important changes we
have made:
Ads transparency. Advertising should be transparent: users
should be able to see all the ads an advertiser is currently
running on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. And for ads with
political content, we've created an archive that will hold ads
with political content for seven years--including information
about ad impressions and spend, as well as demographic data
such as age, gender, and location. People in Canada and Ireland
can already see all the ads that a Page is running on
Facebook--and we're launching this globally in June.
Verification and labeling. Every advertiser will now need
confirm their ID and location before being able to run any ads
with political content in the U.S. All ads with political
content will also clearly state who paid for them.
Updating targeting. We want ads on Facebook to be safe and
civil. We thoroughly criteria advertisers can use to ensure
they are consistent with our principles. As a result, we
removed nearly one-third of the targeting segments used by the
IRA. We continue to allow some criteria that people may find
controversial. But we do see businesses marketing things like
historical books, documentaries or television shows using them
in legitimate ways.
Better technology. Over the past year, we've gotten
increasingly better at finding and disabling fake accounts. We
now block millions of fake accounts each day as people try to
create them--and before they've done any harm. This is thanks
to improvements in machine learning and artificial
intelligence, which can proactively identify suspicious
behavior at a scale that was not possible before--without
needing to look at the content itself.
Action to tackle fake news. We are working hard to stop the
spread of false news. We work with third party fact checking
organizations to limit the spread of articles with rated false.
To reduce the spread of false news, we remove fake accounts and
disrupt economic incentives for traffickers of misinformation.
We also use various signals, including feedback from our
community, to identify potential false news. In countries where
we have partnerships with independent third-party fact-
checkers, stories rated as false by those fact-checkers are
shown lower in News Feed. If Pages or domains repeatedly create
or share misinformation, we significantly reduce their
distribution and remove their advertising rights. We also want
to empower people to decide for themselves what to read, trust,
and share. We promote news literacy and work to inform people
with more context. For example, if third-party fact-checkers
write articles about a news story, we show them immediately
below the story in the Related Articles unit. We also notify
people and Page Admins if they try to share a story, or have
shared one in the past, that's been determined to be false. In
addition to our own efforts, we're learning from academics,
scaling our partnerships with third-party fact-checkers, and
talking to other organizations about how we can work together.
Significant investments in security. We're doubling the
number of people working on safety and security from 10,000
last year to over 20,000 this year. We expect these investments
to impact our profitability. But the safety of people using
Facebook needs to come before profit.
Industry collaboration. Recently, we joined 34 global tech
and security companies in signing a TechAccord pact to help
improve security for everyone.
Information sharing and reporting channels. In the 2017
German elections, we worked closely with the authorities there,
including the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).
This gave them a dedicated reporting channel for security
issues related to the Federal elections.
Tracking 40+ elections. In recent months, we've started to
deploy new tools and teams to proactively identify threats in
the run-up to specific elections. We first tested this effort
during the Alabama Senate election, and plan to continue these
efforts for globe, including the U.S. midterms. Last year we
used public service announcements to help inform people about
fake news in 21 separate countries, including in advance of
French, Kenyan and German elections.
Action against the Russia-based IRA. In April, we removed 70
Facebook and 65 Instagram accounts--as well as 138 Facebook
Pages--controlled by the IRA primarily targeted either at
people living in Russia or Russian-speakers around the world
including from neighboring countries like Azerbaijan,
Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. The IRA has repeatedly used complex
networks of inauthentic accounts to deceive and manipulate
people in the U.S., Europe, and Russia--and we don't want them
on Facebook anywhere in the world.
We are taking steps to enhance trust in the authenticity of
activity on our platform, including increasing ads transparency,
implementing a more robust ads review process, imposing tighter content
restrictions, and exploring how to add additional authenticity
safeguards.
Question 36. Hate Speech: Over the past months, human rights
organizations and other civil society groups have raised attention to
concerns over Facebook's insufficient response to hate speech in
countries where there is a credible threat of violence. In addition to
Myanmar, the New York Times recently published an article on how mob
violence against Muslims in Sri Lanka was spurred by a baseless rumor
that a Muslim restaurant owner was secretly feeding sterilization pills
to women from the Sinhalese-Buddhist community.
Mr. Zuckerberg and other members of Facebook management have
expressed a renewed commitment to providing resources to address these
threats, including taking action to address those who generate hate
speech. As Mr. Zuckerberg noted, AI will not be able to resolve such
complex matters in the near or medium term, necessitating teams that
deal with local languages and context. While Facebook currently has
approximately 1,200 German content reviewers to comply with
regulations, it only has plans to hire ``dozens'' of Burmese content
reviewers. Hiring staff with reviewers, market specialists and analysts
with the appropriate expertise can be difficult, but these reports of
violence demonstrate the human cost of insufficient community resources
to handle content and complaints.
What ``specific product changes'' will you be making to address
hate speech in such countries? Will the new product changes enable
content that violates Facebook's Community Standards to be removed
within 24 hours?
Answer. We've been too slow to deal with the hate and violence in
places like Myanmar and Sri Lanka. The challenges we face in a country
that has fast come online are very different than those in other parts
of the world, and we are investing in people, technology, and programs
to help address them as effectively as possible.
We are increasing the number of Burmese and Sinhalese-language
content reviewers as we continue to grow and invest in Myanmar and Sri
Lanka. Our goal is always to have the right number of people with the
right native language capabilities to ensure incoming reports are
reviewed quickly and effectively. That said, there is more to tackling
this problem than reported content. A lot of abuse may go unreported,
which is why we are supplementing our hiring with investments in
technology and programs.
We are building new tools so that we can more quickly and
effectively detect abusive, hateful, or false content. We have, for
example, designated several hate figures and organizations for
repeatedly violating our hate speech policies, which has led to the
removal of accounts and content that support, praise, or represent
these individuals or organizations. We are also investing in artificial
intelligence that will help us improve our understanding of dangerous
content.
We are further strengthening our civil society partner network so
that we have a better understanding of local context and challenges. We
are focusing on digital literacy education with local partners in
Myanmar and Sri Lanka. For example, we launched a local language
version of our Community Standards (https://www.facebook.com/safety/
resources/myanmar) to educate new users on how to use Facebook
responsibly in 2015 and we have been promoting these actively in
Myanmar, reaching over 8 million people through promotional posts on
our platform alone. We've also rolled out several education programs
and workshops with local partners to update them on our policies and
tools so that they can use this information in outreach to communities
around the country. One example of our education initiatives is our
work with the team that developed the Panzagar initiative (https://
www.facebook.com/supportflowerspeech) to develop the Panzagar
counterspeech Facebook stickers to empower people in Myanmar to share
positive messages online. We also recently released locally illustrated
false news tips, which were promoted on Facebook and in consumer print
publications. We have a dedicated Safety Page for Myanmar (https://
www.facebook.com/safety/resources/myanmarand) and have delivered hard
copies of our local language Community Standards and safety and
security tips to civil society groups in Myanmar who have distributed
them around the country for trainings. Similarly, in Sri Lanka, we ran
a promotion in English, Sinhalese, and Tamil at the top of News Feeds
in April 2017 to educate people on our Community Standards, in
particular hate speech. The content has been viewed almost 100M times
by almost 4M people.
Question 37. Does Facebook believe that it has hired or will hire
within the year a sufficient number of content reviewers and
established local emergency points of contact for all regions where its
platform could inadvertently facilitate communal violence?
Answer. We are investing in people, technology, and programs to
help address the very serious challenges we have seen in places like
Myanmar and Sri Lanka.
Our content review teams around the world--which grew by 3,000
people last year--work 24 hours a day and in over 50 languages.
Over the last two years, we have added dozens more Burmese language
reviewers to handle reports from users across our services, and we plan
to more than double the number of content reviewers focused on user
reports. We also have increased the number of people across the company
working on Myanmar-related issues and we have a special product team
working to better understand the local challenges and build the right
tools to help keep people in the country safe. We will continue to hire
more staff dedicated to Myanmar, including Burmese speakers and policy
experts.
In Sri Lanka, we are increasing the number of Sinhalese language
experts sevenfold. From a programmatic perspective, we will continue to
work with experts to develop safety resources and counter-speech
campaigns in these regions and conduct regular training for civil
society and community groups on using our tools.
Facebook is committed to continuing to provide a platform where
people can raise awareness about human rights abuses around the globe,
and we have a track record of partnering with experts and local
organizations on these issues. For example, we have been part of the
Global Network Initiative (GNI) since 2013. That organization brings
together industry, civil society, academics, and socially-responsible
investors to address freedom-of-expression and privacy issues online.
An independent assessor conducted a human-rights-impact assessment of
Facebook to confirm that we comply with GNI's principles.
Question 38. What product changes, operational decisions, and
resource allocations has Facebook made in order to avoid future risks
such as those made abundantly clear in Myanmar and Sri Lanka?
Answer. We are working to enable freedom of expression around the
globe and ensure that our platform is safe. Our Community Standards
account for situations in which people may be raising awareness of and/
or condemning violence; however, they prohibit hate speech and
celebrating graphic violence. Drawing that line can be complex, which
is why we work with experts and external groups, including local civil
society organizations in places like Myanmar and Sri Lanka, to ensure
that we are taking local context and challenges into account. Our
content review team, which includes native language speakers, carefully
reviews reports that we receive from the public, media, civil society,
and governments. We remove content that violates our policies,
regardless of who posted the content (including the government). We
have also been working with local communities and NGOs for years in
these regions to educate people about hate speech, news literacy, and
our polices. For example, we have introduced an illustrated, Myanmar
language specific copy of our community standards and a customized
safety Page, which we work with our local partners to promote, and we
recently ran a series of public service ads in Myanmar that we
developed with the News Literacy Project to help inform people about
these important issues.
Question 39. What emergency processes for escalation do you have in
place for situations where there is content inciting people to
violence, such as what happened in Sri Lanka?
Answer. We have clear rules against hate speech and content that
incites violence, and we remove such content as soon as we're made
aware of it. In response to the situation in Sri Lanka, we're building
up teams that deal with reported content, working with civil society
and government to learn more about local context and changing language,
and exploring the use of technology to help. We want to provide direct
reporting channels to civil society partners so that they can alert us
to offline activity that might prompt an increase in violating content
on Facebook. We work with local civil society organizations to
understand what types of reporting channels would best serve their
specific communities and are engaging with organizations in Sri Lanka
to understand what more we can do. We are committed to having the right
policies, products, people, and partnerships in place to help keep our
community in Sri Lanka safe.
Question 40. In the context of Sri Lanka and Myanmar, rumors
present a credible threat of violence and have resulted in violence.
Are rumors such as those in Sri Lanka interpreted as violations under
your existing ``credible threat'' policy? How do your systems or
reporting mechanisms account for such country or context specific
threats? Given how quickly such content can lead to violence, do you
apply different processes or response time targets to prioritize
content categorized as hate speech?
Answer. We require everyone on Facebook to comply with our
Community Standards, and we carefully review reports of threatening
language to identify serious threats of harm to public and personal
safety. We recognize our services have an important role to play in
countries that are fast coming online. That's why we're investing in
people, technology, and programs to address the challenges we face in
these countries. We've added more local language reviewers, established
dedicated product teams, rolled out better reporting tools and appeals,
and are removing fake accounts, hate groups and individuals. We remove
credible threats of physical harm to individuals and specific threats
of theft, vandalism, or other financial harm. We also prohibit the use
of Facebook to facilitate or organize criminal activity that causes
physical harm to people, businesses or animals, or financial damage to
people or businesses, and we work with law enforcement when we believe
there is a genuine risk of physical harm or direct threats to public
safety. As part of our work in places like Sri Lanka and Myanmar, we
are strengthening our relationships with civil society organizations to
ensure we are taking local context, challenges, and tensions into
account.
Question 41. The anti-Muslim monk, U Wirathu, was reportedly banned
by Facebook in January 2018 after having been frequently reported for
hate content. Despite several bans, he was able to recreate a presence
on the platform on several occasions and there are to this day accounts
which carry his name. What mechanisms do you have in place to remove
users who repeatedly breach Facebook's Community Standards and what
actions are you taking to guarantee their permanent removal?
Answer. Our Community Standards (https://www.facebook.com/community
standards) prohibit hate speech that targets people based on their
race, ethnic identity, or religion. We remove violating content when it
is reported to us. We also have designated several hate figures and
hate organizations in Myanmar. These include Wirathu, Thuseitta, Ma Ba
Tha, and Parmaukkha. This means these individuals or organizations are
not allowed a presence on Facebook, and we will remove accounts and
content that support, praise or represent these individuals or
organizations.
In addition to removing content that violates our Community
Standards or Page Terms, we disable the accounts of repeat infringers
in appropriate circumstances.
Over the last several months, we have proactively searched for and
removed content on the platform that praises, supports, or represents
Wirathu.
Question 42. Human Rights--Iran: Iranian women's rights and pro-
democracy advocates have reported that copyright infringement and
content reporting mechanisms have been instrumentalized by pro-
government actors to take down their Instagram pages and Facebook
Groups over the past several years. While community reporting
mechanisms are necessary, and often legally required, for operating a
platform as large as Facebook, the threat posed by abusive reporting
also demonstrates the need for human reviewers. Likewise, the trolling,
hacking, and impersonation that frequently target Iranian dissidents
also necessitate teams that are empowered to deal with the Persian
language and the Iranian context. However, many activists have
struggled to establish relationships or receive help from Facebook to
have such issues addressed.
Answer. We recognize that individuals and entities may purposefully
report content en masse in an attempt to stifle speech. That is why we
believe content must be reviewed with the appropriate context.
We are proud that our platform has been used to inspire people to
stand up for their beliefs and values, even in the face of intimidating
opposition, and we regularly provide tools and programmatic resources
to activists and journalists. We also make materials available to
ensure activists and journalists are able to use Facebook safely.
Based on the foundation established in the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human
Rights, Facebook joined the ICT-sector specific Global Network
Initiative in 2013. As part of our commitments as a GNI member, we
routinely conduct human rights impact assessments of our product and
policy decisions and engage with external stakeholders to inform this
work. We are also independently assessed against our compliance with
the GNI Principles every two years.
Question 43. What measures, such as verification of accounts, has
Facebook taken to address the impersonation of Iranian activists,
cultural dissidents, and other public figures?
Answer. Claiming to be another person violates our Community
Standards, and we want to make it harder for anyone to be impersonated
on our platform. Users can also report accounts that are impersonating
them. We've developed several techniques to help detect and block this
type of abuse. At the time someone receives a friend request, our
systems are designed to check whether the recipient already has a
friend with the same name, along with a variety of other factors that
help us determine if an interaction is legitimate. Further, we recently
announced new features that use face recognition technology that may
help detect when someone is using another user's image as their profile
photo--which helps stop impersonation. This is an area we're
continually working to improve so that we can provide a safe and secure
experience on Facebook.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. You said at the hearing that Facebook users own and
control their data. But I am not persuaded that the company has done an
adequate job explaining, for example, what specific information the
company collects about individuals, how that information is being used
and kept safe, and how they can easily delete or modify it. If you and
your company are committed to putting privacy first, I urge that you
answer these questions in a precise, accurate, but straightforward way.
I understand your legal team will be reviewing this, but I hope you
resist complexity and answer these questions in a way that any American
could understand.
Please list and describe all of the types and categories of data
that Facebook collects and how Facebook uses this data. This includes,
but is not limited to, data collected:
on the Facebook platform (e.g., posts, messages, and search
history);
off the Facebook platform (quantify how ubiquitous
Facebook's plugins are on the web, for instance);
on products offered by Facebook family companies;
on specific devices (e.g., smartphone microphone and camera,
other apps, data from the operating system);
via third-party companies and app developers;
from data brokers; and
from publishers.
For each, describe whether users own the data, and what options
users have to modify or delete the data.
Answer. We believe that it's important to communicate with people
about the information that we collect and how people can control it.
That is why we work hard to provide this information to people in a
variety of ways: in our Data Policy, and in Privacy Basics, which
provides walkthroughs of the most common privacy questions we receive.
Beyond simply disclosing our practices, we also think it's important to
give people access to their own information, which we do through our
Download Your Information and Access Your Information tools, Activity
Log, and Ad Preferences, all of which are accessible through our
Privacy Shortcuts tool. We also provide information about these topics
as people are using the Facebook service itself.
We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other
important tools are too hard to find and that we must do more to keep
people informed. So, we're taking additional steps to put people more
in control of their privacy. For instance, we redesigned our entire
settings menu on mobile devices from top to bottom to make things
easier to find. We also created a new Privacy
Shortcuts in a menu where users can control their data in just a
few taps, with clearer explanations of how our controls work. The
experience is now clearer, more visual, and easy-to-find. Furthermore,
we also updated our terms of service that include our commitments to
everyone using Facebook. We explain the services we offer in language
that's easier to read. We're also updating our Data Policy to better
spell out what data we collect and how we use it in Facebook,
Instagram, Messenger, and other products.
In response to your specific questions, depending on which Services
a person uses, we collect different kinds of information from or about
them. This is described in our Data Policy:
Things Users and others do and provide. Information and
content users provide. We collect the content, communications
and other information users provide when they use our Products,
including when they sign up for an account, create or share
content, and message or communicate with others. This can
include information in or about the content they provide (like
metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file
was created. It can also include what users see through
features we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things
like suggest masks and filters that they might like, or give
users tips on using camera formats. Our systems automatically
process content and communications users provide to analyze
context and what's in them for the purposes described below.
Learn more about how people can control who can see the things
they share.
Data with special protections: Users can choose to
provide information in their Facebook profile fields or
Life Events about their religious views, political views,
who they are ``interested in,'' or their health. This and
other information (such as racial or ethnic origin,
philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership) could be
subject to special protections under the laws of their
country.
Networks and connections. We collect information about the
people, Pages, accounts, hashtags, and groups users are
connected to and how they interact with them across our
Products, such as people a user communicates with the most or
groups users are part of. We also collect contact information
if they choose to upload, sync, or import it from a device
(such as an address book or call log or SMS log history), which
we use for things like helping them and others find people they
may know and for the other purposes listed below.
People's usage. We collect information about how people use
our Products, such as the types of content they view or engage
with; the features they use; the actions they take; the people
or accounts they interact with; and the time, frequency, and
duration of their activities. For example, we log when they're
using and have last used our Products, and what posts, videos,
and other content they view on our Products. We also collect
information about how they use features like our camera.
Information about transactions made on our Products. If
people use our Products for purchases or other financial
transactions (such as when users make a purchase in a game or
make a donation), we collect information about the purchase or
transaction. This includes payment information, such as their
credit or debit card number and other card information; other
account and authentication information; and billing, shipping,
and contact details.
Things others do and information they provide about users.
We also receive and analyze content, communications, and
information that other people provide when they use our
Products. This can include information about them, such as when
others share or comment on a photo of a user, send a message to
them, or upload, sync or import their contact information.
Device Information. As described below, we collect
information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs
and other web-connected devices they use that integrate with
our Products, and we combine this information across different
devices they use. For example, we use information collected
about their use of our Products on their phone to better
personalize the content (including ads) or features they see
when they use our Products on another device, such as their
laptop or tablet, or to measure whether they took an action in
response to an ad we showed they on their phone on a different
device.
Information we obtain from these devices includes:
Device attributes: information such as the operating
system, hardware and software versions, battery level,
signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app
and file names and types, and plugins.
Device operations: information about operations and
behaviors performed on the device, such as whether a window
is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which
can help distinguish humans from bots).
Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other
identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts people
use, and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to
Facebook Company Products associated with the same device
or account).
Device signals: Bluetooth signals, and information
about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers.
Data from device settings: information users allow us
to receive through device settings people turn on, such as
access to their GPS location, camera, or photos.
Network and connections: information such as the name
of users' mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone,
mobile phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in
some cases, information about other devices that are nearby
or on users' network, so we can do things like help people
stream a video.
Cookie data: data from cookies stored on a user's
device, including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about
how we use cookies in the Facebook Cookies Policy (https://
www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/) and Instagram Cookies
Policy (https://www.instagram.com/legal/cookies/).
Information from partners. Advertisers, app developers, and
publishers can send us information through Facebook Business
Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the Like
button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook
pixel. These partners provide information about users'
activities off Facebook--including information about a user's
device, websites users visit, purchases users make, the ads
they see, and how they use their services--whether or not they
have a Facebook account or are logged into Facebook. For
example, a game developer could use our API to tell us what
games users play, or a business could tell us about a purchase
a user made in its store. We also receive information about a
user's online and offline actions and purchases from third-
party data providers who have the rights to provide us with
their information. Partners receive user data when users visit
or use their services or through third parties they work with.
We require each of these partners to have lawful rights to
collect, use and share user data before providing any data to
us.
People own what they share on Facebook, and they can manage things
like who sees their posts and the information they choose to include on
their profile.
Any person can see each of the specific interests we maintain about
them for advertising by visiting Ads Preferences, which lets people see
what interests we use to choose ads for them--and to edit or delete
these interests. They can choose not to see ads from a particular
advertiser or not to see ads based on their use of third-party websites
and apps. They also can choose not to see ads off Facebook that are
based on the interests we derive from their activities on Facebook.
Our Download Your Information or ``DYI'' tool is Facebook's data
portability tool and was launched many years ago to let people access
and download many types of information that we maintain about them. The
data in DYI and in our Ads Preferences tool contain each of the
interest categories that are used to show people ads, along with
information about the advertisers are currently running ads based on
their use of an advertiser's website or app. People also can choose not
to see ads from those advertisers. We recently announced expansions to
Download Your Information, which, among other things, will make it
easier for people to see their data, delete it, and easily download and
export it. More information is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/
news/2018/04/new-privacy-protections/.
And we recently announced plans to build Clear History. This
feature will enable users to see the websites and apps that send us
information when they use them, delete this information from their
accounts, and turn off our ability to store it associated with their
accounts going forward. Apps and websites that use features such as the
Like button or Facebook Analytics send us information to make their
content and ads better. We also use this information to make users'
experiences on Facebook better. If a user clears their history or use
the new setting, we'll remove identifying information so a history of
the websites and apps they've used won't be associated with their
account. We'll still provide apps and websites with aggregated
analytics--for example, we can build reports when we're sent this
information so we can tell developers if their apps are more popular
with men or women in a certain age group. We can do this without
storing the information in a way that's associated with a user's
account, and as always, we don't tell advertisers who a user is.
Question 2. What data does Facebook collect about non-users? For
example, when a user first joins Facebook, what data has Facebook
already typically collected about them? Assume that the new user is an
average American and active web user with many friends who are already
on Facebook. List the attributes that Facebook would typically know
about the new user and where that information comes from. If Facebook
collects information about non-users, what is the purpose?
Answer. Facebook does not create profiles or track website visits
for people without a Facebook account.
When people visit apps or websites that feature our technologies--
like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers automatically log
(i) standard browser or app records of the fact that a particular
device or user visited the website or app (this connection to
Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a website
or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button, and is an
inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any additional
information the publisher of the app or website chooses to share with
Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as the fact
that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard feature of
the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same information
with multiple different third-parties whenever people visit their
website or app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's website
shares information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick and with
the analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a person visits
the Committee's website, it sends browser information about their visit
to each one of those third parties. More information about how this
works is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-
facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for this
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us--
described above--in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First,
these logs are critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to
detecting or preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser
has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign
the device might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a
potentially inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to
register for an account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide
summaries and insights to websites and apps about how many people visit
or use their product or use specific features like our Like button--but
without providing any information about a specific person. We do not
create profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use browser and app
logs for non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from our advertisers
to them or otherwise seek to personalize the content they see. However,
we may take the opportunity to show a general ad that is unrelated to
the attributes of the person or an ad encouraging the non-user to sign
up for Facebook.
Question 3. Last year, how many Facebook users clicked on their
privacy settings at least once? What was the average time a user spent
adjusting their privacy controls? How often does an average user go
into their privacy settings (per year, for instance)? In 2017, how many
times did Facebook modify the user experience of its privacy settings
to better suit its users? What other analytics of this kind does
Facebook measure?
Answer. Privacy is at the core of everything we do, and our
approach to privacy starts with our commitment to transparency and
control. Our threefold approach to transparency includes, first,
whenever possible, providing information on the data we collect and use
and how people can control it in context and in our products. Second,
we provide information about how we collect and use data in our user
agreements and related educational materials. And third, we enable
people to learn more about the specific data we have about them through
interactive tools such as Download Your Information, which lets people
download a file containing data that they may want to take to another
service, and Access Your Information, a tool we are launching that will
let people more easily access and manage their data on Facebook.
Our approach to control is based on the belief that people should
be able to choose who can see what they share and how their data shapes
their experience on Facebook. People can control the audience for their
posts and the apps that can receive their data. They can see and delete
the history of their activities on Facebook, and, if they no longer
want to use Facebook, they can delete their account and the data
associated with it. Of course, we recognize that controls are only
useful if people know how to find and use them. That is why we
continuously deliver in-product educational videos in people's News
Feeds on important privacy topics. We are also inviting people to take
our Privacy Checkup--which prompts people to review key data controls--
and we are sharing privacy tips in education campaigns off of Facebook,
including through ads on other websites. To make our privacy controls
easier to find, we are launching a new settings menu that features core
privacy settings in a single place. We are always working to help
people understand and control how their data shapes their experience on
Facebook.
Question 4. At the hearing, you said that you don't believe that
enough users read Facebook's terms-of-service policy. Facebook has some
of tech's smartest UX and behavioral experts, which is evident by a
platform that millions of people use for hours each week. How is
Facebook applying its UX and behavioral expertise to track and improve
user engagement in this area? What does Facebook know about its users'
understanding of its terms-of-service? For example, how long do users
take to read Facebook's policies, on average? What does this number
indicate about whether users have actually read the material?
Answer. We believe that it's important to communicate with people
about the information that we collect and how people can control it.
This is why we work hard to provide this information to people in a
variety of ways: in our Data Policy, and in Privacy Basics, which
provides walkthroughs of the most common privacy questions we receive.
Beyond simply disclosing our practices, we also think it's important to
give people access to their own information, which we do through our
Download Your Information and Access Your Information tools, Activity
Log, and Ad Preferences, all of which are accessible through our
Privacy Shortcuts tool. We also provide information about these topics
as people are using the Facebook service itself.
As to your specific question, there is no single number that
measures how much time people spend understanding how Facebook services
work, in large part because Facebook seeks, as much as possible, to put
controls and information in context within its service. While ``up
front'' information like that contained in the terms of service are
useful, research overwhelmingly demonstrates that in-product controls
and education are the most meaningful to people and the most likely to
be read and understood. On-demand controls are also important, and we
recently redesigned our entire settings menu on mobile devices from top
to bottom to make things easier to find. We also created a new Privacy
Shortcuts, a menu where people can control their data in just a few
taps, with clearer explanations of how our controls work. The
experience is now clearer, more visual, and easy-to-find.
Improving people's understanding of how digital services work is an
industry-wide challenge that we are highly committed to addressing.
That's why, over the last 18 months, we've run a global series of
design workshops called ``Design Jams'', bringing together experts in
design, privacy, law, and computer science to work collaboratively on
new and innovative approaches. These workshops have run in Paris,
London, Dublin, Berlin, Sao Paolo, Hong Kong, and other cities, and
included global regulators and policymakers. At these workshops, expert
teams use ``people centric design'' methods to create innovative new
design prototypes and experiences to improve transparency and education
in digital services. These workshops inform Facebook's constantly-
improving approach.
In recognition of the need for improved approaches to data
transparency across all digital services, working with partners from
academia, design, and industry we recently launched TTC Labs, a design
innovation lab that seeks to improve user experiences around personal
data. TTC Labs is an open platform for sharing and innovation and
contains insights from leading experts in academia, design, and law, in
addition to prototype designs from the design jams, template services
and open-source toolkits for people-centric design for transparency,
trust and control of data. Working collaboratively, and based on open-
source approaches, TTC Labs seeks to pioneer new and more people-
centric best practices for people to understand how their data is used
by digital services, in ways that they find easy to understand and
control.
Facebook is highly committed to improving people's experience of
its own services as well as investing in new innovations and approaches
to support improvements across the industry.
Question 5. Recently you said Facebook would ``make all controls
and settings the same everywhere, not just in Europe.'' Please describe
these controls and settings and what they do? Would the modification of
these controls and settings apply in the U.S. only to new users or to
all users? Would Facebook commit to default those settings and controls
to minimize, to the greatest extent, the collection and use of users'
data? What changes will U.S. users see in their settings and controls
after this change is implemented? And what features and protections
(including but not limited to controls and settings) will European
Facebook users have that will differ from U.S. users after the company
implements GDPR?
Answer. The GDPR requires companies to obtain explicit consent to
process certain kinds of data (``special categories of data'' like
biometric data). We are seeking explicit consent from people in Europe
to three specific uses of data: facial recognition data (which
previously was not enabled in Europe), special categories of data and
use of data we collect off Facebook Company Products to target ads. We
recently began providing direct notice of these controls and our
updated terms to people around the world (including in the U.S.),
allowing people to choose whether or not to enable or disable these
settings or to agree to our updated terms. Outside of Europe we are not
requiring people to complete those flows if they repeatedly indicate
that they do not want to go through the experience. At the same time,
the events of recent months have underscored how important it is to
make sure people know how their information is used and what their
choices are. So, we decided to communicate prominently on Facebook--
through a full-screen message and a reminder to review at a later date.
People can choose to dismiss or ignore these messages and continue
using Facebook.
The controls and settings that Facebook is enabling as part of GDPR
are already available to other users around the world, including in the
U.S.. We also provide identical levels of transparency in our user
agreements and in product notices to people in the U.S. that we are
providing under GDPR.
In the U.S., where these settings are already in place, people will
have a mechanism to maintain their current choice or to change it. In
each of these cases, we want people to make the choice--not Facebook--
so nobody's settings will change as part of this roll out unless they
choose to change an existing setting.
And we also provide the same tools for access, rectification,
erasure, data portability and others to users in in the U.S. and rest
of world that we provide in Europe, and many of those tools (like our
Download Your Information tool, Ads Preferences tool, and Activity Log)
have been available globally for many years.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Edward Markey to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. Mr. Zuckerberg, your company has stated that it has
``no plans'' to include advertisements on Messenger Kids. Will you
pledge that Facebook will never incorporate advertising into Messenger
Kids or any future products for children 12 and under?
Answer. We have no plans to include advertising in Messenger Kids.
Moreover, there are no in-app purchases, and we do not use the data in
Messenger Kids to advertise to kids or their parents. In developing the
app, we assembled a committee of advisors, including experts in child
development, online safety, and media and children's health, and we
continue to work with them on an ongoing basis. In addition, we
conducted roundtables with parents from around the country to ensure we
were addressing their concerns and built the controls they need and
want in the app. We are committed to approaching all efforts related to
children 12 and under thoughtfully, and with the guidance and input of
experts and parents.
Question 2. In your response to my letter on the topic of Messenger
Kids, you stated that your company will not ``automatically'' create a
Facebook account for Messenger Kids users when those children turn 13.
Will you commit to not share children's information for targeted
advertisements, once young users turn 13?
Answer. As we stated in our response to your earlier letter, we
will not automatically create a Facebook account for Messenger Kids
users, or automatically transition a Messenger Kids account into a
Facebook account once a child turns 13. Contained within that
commitment and our commitment not to use data collected within
Messenger Kids to market to kids or their parents is a commitment that
we will not automatically enable third parties to send targeted ads to
children who have used Messenger Kids when the child turns 13.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tom Udall to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. Data Protection on Facebook: The General Data
Protection Regulation or ``GDPR'', which will go into effect on May 25
of this year. Will Facebook provide the same privacy protections for
consent, retention, data portability, and transparency to American
consumers that it will provide to EU consumers?
Answer. The controls and settings that Facebook is enabling as part
of GDPR are available to people around the world, including settings
for controlling our use of face recognition on Facebook and for
controlling our ability to use data we collect off Facebook Company
Products to target ads. We recently began providing direct notice of
these controls and our updated terms to people around the world
(including in the U.S.), allowing people to choose whether or not to
enable or disable these settings or to consent to our updated terms. We
provide the same tools for access, rectification, erasure, data
portability and others to people in the U.S. and rest of world that we
provide in Europe, and many of those tools (like our Download Your
Information tool, ad preferences tool, and Activity Log) have been
available globally for many years. We also provide identical levels of
transparency in our user agreements and in product notices to people in
the United States that we are providing under GDPR.
Question 2. What kind of privacy review is required to make a
change to Facebook that impacts user privacy? When did that level of
review become mandatory?
Answer. At Facebook, we make decisions about privacy through a
cross-functional, cross-disciplinary effort overseen by the Chief
Privacy Officer that involves participants from departments across the
company. This process is a collaborative approach to privacy that seeks
to promote strong privacy protections and sound decision making at
every stage of the product development process. Our privacy program is
responsible for reviewing product launches, major changes, and privacy-
related bug fixes to products and features to ensure that privacy
policies and procedures are consistently applied and that key privacy
decisions are implemented for the product. This approach has several
key benefits:
First, it is designed to consider privacy early in the
product development process. This allows us to consider the
benefits that a feature is intended to have for people who use
our services, how data will be used to deliver those benefits,
and how we can build features from the ground up that include
privacy protections to enable those benefits while protecting
people's information and putting them in control.
Second, while complying with our obligations is critically
important, taking a cross-disciplinary approach to privacy
encourages us to think about data protection as more than just
a compliance exercise. Instead, we evaluate how to design
privacy into the features that we build and consider this from
the perspective of things like how we design interfaces that
make data use intuitive, taking a consistent approach to
privacy across our services, and building protections in how
our software is engineered. Accordingly, while we scale our
privacy review process depending on the complexity of a
particular data use, reviews typically involve experts who
evaluate proposed data practices from the perspective of
multiple disciplines.
As part of our consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission,
we submit a report to the FTC every two years. That report is based on
assessments conducted by an independent third party on a bi-annual
basis, which require us to submit evidence to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the program.
Question 3. Before that level of review was required, what checks
were in place to ensure new features would not adversely impact users'
privacy? What level of seniority was required of employees to approve a
launch of such a privacy-impacting feature? For example, have you ever
allowed an intern make changes that impacts customers' privacy?
Answer. See Response to Question 2.
Question 4. Has Facebook ever launched a feature that had to be
turned off because of the privacy concerns? If yes, how many times has
that happened, and how many users were impacted? Did you notify the
users who were impacted?
Answer. See Response to Question 2.
Question 5. Russia/Cambridge Analytica: Between 2010 and 2015, 3rd
party applications were able to keep data indefinitely. Can you say how
many applications downloaded app users' data, their friends' data, or
their personal messages in this period of time?
Answer. We are in the process of investigating every app that had
access to a large amount of information before we changed our Platform
in 2014. The investigation process is in full swing, and it has two
phases. First, a comprehensive review to identify every app that had
access to this amount of Facebook data and to focus on apps that
present reason for deeper investigation. And second, where we have
concerns, we will conduct interviews, make requests for information
(RFI)--which ask a series of detailed questions about the app and the
data it has access to--and perform audits using expert firms that may
include on-site inspections. We have large teams of internal and
external experts working hard to investigate these apps as quickly as
possible. To date thousands of apps have been investigated and around
200 apps have been suspended--pending a thorough investigation into
whether they did in fact misuse any data. Where we find evidence that
these or other apps did misuse data, we will ban them and let people
know.
These apps relate to a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You,
the Cambridge Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality, with many of the
suspended apps being affiliated with the same entity. Many of these
suspensions include apps that appear to be ``test'' apps that were
never released to the public, and therefore would not have acquired
significant user data, although our investigation into these apps is
ongoing.
Additionally, we have suspended an additional 14 apps, which were
installed by around one thousand people. They were all created after
2014, after we made changes to more tightly restrict our platform APIs
to prevent abuse. However, these apps appear to be linked to AIQ, which
was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica. So, we have suspended them
while we investigate further. Any app that refuses to take part in or
fails our audit will be banned.
We will commit to briefing your staff on future developments.
Question 6. Given the recent reports about Cambridge Analytica and
the years of poor security around your data, what measures will be put
into place to ensure that advertisers are not targeting ads using ill-
gotten data?
Answer. We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that Kogan
shared data obtained through his app with Russia or other foreign
governments, but our investigation is ongoing. We are in the process of
investigating every app that had access to a large amount of
information before we changed our Platform in 2014.
In April 2014, we significantly restricted the types of data
generally available to app developers and required apps seeking
additional categories of data to undergo proactive review by our
internal teams. We rejected more than half of the apps seeking these
permissions, including the second version of Kogan's app.
We review apps to ensure that the requested permissions clearly
improve the user experience and that the data obtained is tied to an
experience within the app. We conduct a variety of manual and automated
checks of applications on the platform for Policy compliance, as well
as random sampling. When we find evidence of or receive allegations of
violations, we investigate and, where appropriate, employ a number of
measures, including restricting applications from our platform,
preventing developers from building on our platform in the future, and
taking legal action where appropriate.
Recently, we announced a number of additional steps we're taking to
address concerns raised by Kogan's app.
Review our platform. We will investigate all apps that had
access to large amounts of data before the platform changes we
announced in 2014, and we will audit any app where we identify
suspicious activity. If we identify misuses of data, we'll take
immediate action, including banning the app from our platform
and pursuing legal action if appropriate.
Tell people about data misuse. We will tell people about
apps that have misused their data. This includes building a way
for people to know if their data might have been accessed via
the app. Moving forward, if we remove an app for misusing data,
we will tell everyone who used it.
Turn off access for unused apps. If someone has not used an
app within the last three months, we will turn off the app's
access to their data.
Restrict Facebook Login data. We are changing Login, so that
the only data that an app can request without app review will
include name, profile photo, and e-mail address. Requesting any
other data will require approval from Facebook. We will also no
longer allow apps to ask for access to information like
religious or political views, relationship status and details,
custom friends lists, education and work history, fitness
activity, book reading and music listening activity, news
reading, video watch activity, and games activity. We will
encourage people to manage the apps they use. We already show
people what apps their accounts are connected to and allow them
to control what data they've permitted those apps to use. But
we're making it easier for people to see what apps they use and
the information they have shared with those apps.
Reward people who find vulnerabilities. We launched the Data
Abuse Bounty program so that people can report to us any
misuses of data by app developers.
Update our policies. We have updated our terms and Data
Policy to explain how we use data and how data is shared with
app developers.
Question 7. Will your team re-architect the Facebook platform
software architecture to ensure that 3rd party applications do not have
the ability to store and share data?
Answer. In April 2014, we announced that we would more tightly
restrict our platform APIs to prevent abuse. At that time we made clear
that existing apps would have a year to transition--at which point they
would be forced (1) to migrate to the more restricted API and (2) be
subject to Facebook's new review and approval protocols. A small number
of developers asked for and were granted short-term extensions beyond
the one-year transition period, the longest of which lasted several
months. These extensions ended several years ago. A transition period
of this kind is standard when platforms implement significant changes
to their technology base and was necessary here to avoid disrupting the
experience of millions of people. New apps that launched after April
30, 2014 were required to use our more restrictive platform APIs. We
required apps seeking additional categories of data to undergo
proactive review by our internal teams. We rejected more than half of
the apps seeking these permissions, including the second version of
Kogan's app.
We review apps to ensure that the requested permissions clearly
improve the user experience and that the data obtained is tied to an
experience within the app. We conduct a variety of manual and automated
checks of applications on the platform for Policy compliance, as well
as random sampling. When we find evidence of or receive allegations of
violations, we investigate and, where appropriate, employ a number of
measures, including restricting applications from our platform,
preventing developers from building on our platform in the future, and
taking legal action where appropriate.
Recently, we announced a number of additional steps we're taking to
address concerns raised by Kogan's app.
Review our platform. We will investigate all apps that had
access to large amounts of data before the platform changes we
announced in 2014, and we will audit any app where we identify
suspicious activity. If we identify misuses of data, we'll take
immediate action, including banning the app from our platform
and pursuing legal action if appropriate.
Tell people about data misuse. We will tell people about
apps that have misused their data. This includes building a way
for people to know if their data might have been accessed via
the app. Moving forward, if we remove an app for misusing data,
we will tell everyone who used it.
Reward people who find vulnerabilities. We launched the Data
Abuse Bounty program so that people can report to us any
misuses of data by app developers.
Update our policies. We have updated our terms and Data
Policy to explain how we use data and how data is shared with
app developers.
We are investing so much in security that our costs will increase
significantly. But we want to be clear about what our priority is:
protecting our community is more important than maximizing our profits.
As our CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said, when you are building
something unprecedented like Facebook, there are going to be mistakes.
What people should hold us accountable for is learning from the
mistakes and continually doing better--and, at the end of the day,
making sure that we're building things that people like and that make
their lives better.
Question 8. How will you prevent another developer like Kogan from
creating a viral app for the expressed purpose of gathering data and
downloading, storing, and sharing that data?
See Response to Question 7.
Question 9. How do you know that there are no other copies of the
data that Kogan acquired from Facebook?
Answer. Facebook obtained written certifications from Kogan, GSR,
and other third parties (including Cambridge Analytica and SCL)
declaring that all data they had obtained, and any derivatives, was
accounted for and destroyed. Based on recent allegations, we have
reopened our investigation into the veracity of these certifications
and have hired a forensic auditor to conduct a forensic audit of
Cambridge Analytica's systems. We are currently paused on the audit at
the request of the UK Information Commissioner's Office request, which
is conducting a regulatory investigation into Cambridge Analytica
(based in the UK), and we hope to move forward with that audit soon.
We have suspended SCL/Cambridge Analytica from purchasing
advertising on Facebook.
Question 10. A March 2018 online article in Quartz reported that
Facebook employees and Cambridge Analytica employees were both working
in the Trump Campaign San Antonio headquarters.\1\ How will you ensure
that your advertising salespeople are not engaging with entities
previously identified for violating your terms of service?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Kozlowska, Hanna. 20 March 2018. Facebook and Cambridge
Analytica worked side by side at a Trump campaign office in San
Antonio. https://qz.com/1233579/facebook-and-cambridge-analytica-
worked-side-by-side-at-a-trumpcampaign-office-in-san-antonio/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. No one from Facebook was assigned full-time to the Trump
campaign, or full-time to the Clinton campaign. We offered identical
support to both the Trump and Clinton campaigns, and had teams assigned
to both. Everyone had access to the same tools, which are the same
tools that every campaign is offered. We continuously work to ensure
that we comply with all applicable laws and policies. While our
investigation is ongoing, our review indicates that Facebook employees
did not identify any issues involving the improper use of Facebook data
in the course of their interactions with Cambridge Analytica during the
2016 U.S. Presidential campaign.
Question 11. In a recent press conference,\2\ you state that you
are fully confident you are making progress against foreign actor
manipulating the Facebook platform. Will you provide Congress and the
American people auditable periodic reports about the progress you and
your team are making on fighting disinformation on your platform?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Facebook. 4 April 2018. ``Hard Questions: Q&A with Mark
Zuckerberg on Protecting People's Information''. https://
newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/hard-questions-protecting-peoples-
information/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. We have worked to notify people about this issue, broadly,
through our white paper in April 2017, Information Operations on
Facebook, and our disclosure about the IRA last fall. We have also been
publishing updates on these issues in our Newsroom.
Question 12. Third Party Applications: How many times has Facebook
enforced your terms of services against 3rd party application for
misuse of data?
Answer. We use a variety of tools to enforce Facebook policies
against violating parties, including developers. We review tens of
thousands of apps per year and regularly disapprove noncompliant apps
as part of our proactive review process. We also use tools like cease
and desist letters, account suspensions, letter agreements, and civil
litigation. For example, since 2006, Facebook has sent over 1,150
cease-and-desist letters to over 1,600 targets. In 2017, we took action
against about 370,000 apps, ranging from imposing certain restrictions
to removal of the app from the platform. Moreover, we have required
parties who have procured our data without authorization to delete that
data. We have invested significant resources in these efforts. Facebook
is presently investigating apps that had access to large amounts of
information before we changed our platform policies in 2014 to
significantly reduce the data apps could access. To date around 200
apps (from a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You, the Cambridge
Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality) have been suspended--pending a
thorough investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data.
Question 13. It's clear that, over the course of the Facebook
platform program, enforcement of the Platform Policy has been reactive
rather than proactive. Of all the 3rd party applications, how many such
applications have been reviewed in the past 8 years? How many 3rd party
applications have been removed from the platform due to violations of
the terms of service?
Answer. See Response Question 12.
Question 14. According to your Platform Policy, if you exceed 5
million monthly active users or 100M API calls per day, developers may
be subject to additional terms. What are the additional terms? How many
3rd party applications are currently subject to additional terms?
Answer. In circumstances where developers make a high volume of API
calls, Facebook may impose additional terms, which are generally
negotiated and vary depending on which APIs are at issue.
In addition, Facebook has a set of APIs that enable certain
partners, primarily operating systems and device manufacturers, to
provide people with Facebook-like experiences (e.g., Facebook apps,
news feed notifications, address book syncs) in their products. We
developed these APIs, which are commonly known as ``device-integrated
APIs,'' in the early days of mobile when the demand for Facebook
outpaced our ability to build versions of our product that worked on
every phone or operating system. Several dozen companies still used
them at the start of the year, including Amazon, Apple, Blackberry,
HTC, Microsoft, Huawei, Lenovo and Samsung, among others. On April 23,
2018, we announced that we would wind down these APIs. So far over 30
of these partnerships have been ended, including with Huawei.
These device-integrated APIs are different from the platform APIs
that were used by Alexandr Kogan, which were the focus of the hearing
and went to the heart of the Cambridge Analytica matter. Third party
developers using our platform APIs built new, social experiences
incorporating information that Facebook users brought with them; by
contrast, the very point of our device-integrated APIs was to enable
other companies to create Facebook functionality, primarily for devices
and operating systems. The experiences that partners built using our
device-integrated APIs were reviewed and approved by Facebook, and
partners could not integrate the user's Facebook features without the
user's permission.
Question 15. For the Platform Policy for Messenger, how do you
ensure that malicious actors are not using bots using the Messenger API
to spread disinformation to users at a mass scale?
Answer. Businesses large and small are using bots for Messenger to
connect with their customers in a way that is convenient, functional,
and enables them to connect with customers at scale. We give people
control of their experience. We offer a set of tools that allow a
person to block or mute a bot or business at any time and people can
also report bots where the Facebook Community Operations team will
review and take action if appropriate. Finally, a few months ago we
announced that bot developers are now required to have business
verification for apps/bots that need access to specialized APIs as a
result of our ongoing efforts to ensure integrity across our platforms.
Question 16. Facebook--Suite of Application--Onavo VPN: Do know
whether customers who download the virtual private network, or VPN, of
Facebook's subsidiary Onavo's understand that any activity occurring on
their mobile device is being collected and stored by Facebook? Doesn't
this practice violate the privacy consumers expect of a VPN?
Answer. When people first install the iOS version of the Onavo
Protect app, we explain that Onavo uses a VPN that ``helps keep you and
your data safe by understanding when you visit potentially malicious or
harmful websites and giving you a warning.'' In addition, the first
screen that a person sees when installing the app explains, under a
heading that reads ``Data Analysis'':
``When you use our VPN, we collect the info that is sent to,
and received from, your mobile device. This includes
information about: your device and its location, apps installed
on your device and how you use those apps, the websites you
visit, and the amount of data use.
This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service by
analyzing your use of websites, apps and data. Because we're a
part of Facebook, we also use this info to improve Facebook
products and services, gain insights into the products and
services people value, and build better experiences.''
People must tap a button marked ``Accept & Continue'' after seeing
this information in a full-screen interstitial before they can use the
app.
The Android version of the Onavo Protect app offers data management
features (e.g., the ability to block apps from using background data)
that do not require users to enable the app's VPN.
For both versions of the app, we communicate repeatedly and up
front--in the App Store description, in Onavo's Privacy Policy, and in-
line at the time the user first opens the app after downloading it--
that Onavo is part of Facebook and what that means for how Onavo
Protect handles data in other ways.
More broadly, websites and apps have used market research services
for years. We use Onavo, App Annie, comScore, and publicly available
tools to help us understand the market and improve all our services.
When people download Onavo to manage their data usage and help secure
their connection, we are clear about the information we collect and how
it is used. Like other VPNs, when the Onavo VPN is enabled, Onavo
Protect helps create a secure connection, including when people are on
public Wi-Fi. As part of this process, Onavo receives their mobile data
traffic. This helps us improve and operate the Onavo service. Because
we're part of Facebook, we also use this information to improve
Facebook products and services. We let people know about this activity,
and other ways that Onavo uses, analyzes, and shares data (for example,
the apps installed on users' devices) in the App Store descriptions,
and when they first open the app after downloading it.
Facebook does not use Onavo data for Facebook product uses, nor
does it append any Onavo data or data about individuals' app usage to
Facebook accounts.
Question 17. According to this Wall Street Journal article,
Facebook uses data collected from the Onavo suite of applications to
monitor potentially competitive application.\3\ Since the acquisition
in 2013, how specifically has Facebook used information from Onavo to
inform acquisitions as well as product development?

Answer. See Response to Question 16.
Question 18. Terms of Service: Has Facebook ever disclosed to its
users which ``third parties partners'' have access to user information?
If no, will you publish this list so that users know which outside
parties have access to their information?
Answer. Facebook allows people to view, manage, and remove the apps
that they have logged into with Facebook through the App Dashboard. We
recently prompted everyone to review their App Dashboard as a part of a
Privacy Checkup, and we also provided an educational notice on Facebook
to encourage people to review their settings. More information about
how users can manage their app settings is available at https://
www.facebook.com/help/218345114850283?helpref=about_content.
The categories of information that an app can access is clearly
disclosed before the user consents to use an app on Facebook platform.
Users can view and edit the categories of information that apps they
have used have access to through the App Dashboard.
Question 19. User Tracking: Does Facebook can ``track a user's
Internet browsing activity, even after that user has logged off of the
Facebook platform''? If yes, how Facebook discloses that kind of
tracking to its users? And can users opt-out of this kind of tracking?
Answer. When people visit apps or websites that feature our
technologies--like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers
automatically log (i) standard browser or app records of the fact that
a particular device or user visited the website or app (this connection
to Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a
website or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button,
and is an inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any
additional information the publisher of the app or website chooses to
share with Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as
the fact that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard
feature of the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same
information with multiple different third-parties whenever people visit
their website or app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's
website shares information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick
and with the analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a
person visits the Committee's website, it sends browser information
about their visit to each one of those third parties. More information
about how this works is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/
04/data-off-facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for this
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us--
described above--in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First,
these logs are critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to
detecting or preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser
has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign
the device might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a
potentially inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to
register for an account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide
summaries and insights to websites and apps about how many people visit
or use their product, or use specific features like our Like button--
but without providing any information about a specific person. We do
not create profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use browser and
app logs for non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from our
advertisers to them or otherwise seek to personalize the content they
see. However, we may take the opportunity to show a general ad that is
unrelated to the attributes of the person or an ad encouraging the non-
user to sign up for Facebook.
When the individual is a Facebook user, we are also able to use
this information to personalize their experiences on Facebook, whether
or not they are logged out, but we will not target ads to users relying
on this information unless the user allows this in their privacy
settings. We do not sell or share this information with third-parties.
Question 20. How many Facebook ``Like'' buttons there are on non-
Facebook web pages?
Answer. Facebook does not publish tracking software. When people
visit apps or websites that feature our technologies--like the Facebook
Like or Comment button--our servers automatically log (i) standard
browser or app records of the fact that a particular device or user
visited the website or app (this connection to Facebook's servers
occurs automatically when a person visits a website or app that
contains our technologies, such as a Like button, and is an inherent
function of Internet design); and (ii) any additional information the
publisher of the app or website chooses to share with Facebook about
the person's activities on that site (such as the fact that a purchase
was made on the site).
This is a standard feature of the Internet, and most websites and
apps share this same information with multiple different third-parties
whenever people visit their website or app. For example, the Senate
Commerce Committee's website shares information with Google and its
affiliate DoubleClick and with the analytics company Webtrends. This
means that, when a person visits the Committee's website, it sends
browser information about their visit to each one of those third
parties. More information about how this works is available at https://
newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-facebook/.
During the week prior to April 16, 2018, on sites that use Facebook
services: the Like button appeared on 8.4M websites, the Share button
on 931K websites covering 275M webpages, and there were 2.2M Facebook
pixels installed on websites.
Question 21. How many Facebook ``Share'' buttons there are on non-
Facebook web pages?
Answer. See Response to Question 20.
Question 22. How many non-Facebook websites have Facebook pixel
code?
Answer. See Response to Question 20.
Question 23. While users can download their user generated data
using the ``Download Your Information'' tool, how can users download
data that Facebook has inferred about them?
Answer. Our Download Your Information or ``DYI'' tool is Facebook's
data portability tool and was launched many years ago to let people
access and download many types of information that we maintain about
them. The data in DYI and in our Ads Preferences tool contain each of
the interest categories that are used to show people ads, along with
information about the advertisers are currently running ads based on
their use of an advertiser's website or app. People also can choose not
to see ads from those advertisers. We recently announced expansions to
Download Your Information, which, among other things, will make it
easier for people to see their data, delete it, and easily download and
export it. More information is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/
news/2018/04/new-privacy-protections/.
Responding to feedback that we should do more to provide
information about websites and apps that send us information when
people use them, we also announced plans to build Clear History. This
new feature will enable users to see the websites and apps that send us
information when they use them, delete this information from their
account, and turn off Facebook's ability to store it associated with
their account going forward.
We have also introduced Access Your Information. This feature
provides a new way for people to access and manage their information.
Users can go here to delete anything from their timeline or profile
that they no longer want on Facebook. They can also see their ad
interests, as well as information about ads they've clicked on and
advertisers who have provided us with information about them that
influence the ads they see. From here, they can go to their ad settings
to manage how this data is used to show them ads.
Question 24. How many websites have Facebook-tracking software on
them? What percentage of all Internet sites have Facebook-tracking
software?
Answer. See Response to Question 20.
Question 25. According to a Gizmodo report,\4\ Facebook collects
data on people using Shadow Profiles. Do you collect data on people who
are not Facebook users? Please describe the process for non-Facebook
users can employ to delete any data collected about them by the
company.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. Yes. If a person doesn't have a Facebook account but
believes Facebook may have information about them, they can contact us
to request a copy of your information. A contact form is available at
https://www.facebook.com/help/contact/180237885820953. However,
Facebook does not create profiles about or track web or app browser
behavior of non-users.
When people visit apps or websites that feature our technologies--

the non-user to sign up for Facebook.
Question 26. Do you support a kids' privacy bill of rights where
opt-in is the standard?
Answer. Facebook is generally not opposed to regulation but wants
to ensure it is the right regulation. The issues facing the industry
are complex, multi-faceted, and affect an important part of peoples'
lives. As such, Facebook is absolutely committed to working with
regulators, like Congress, to craft the right regulations. Facebook
would be happy to review any proposed legislation and provide comments.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Gary Peters to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. A major challenge artificial intelligence (AI) and
machine learning developers need to address is the ability to ensure
prolonged safety, security, and fairness of the systems. This is
especially true of systems designed to work in complex environments
that may be difficult to replicate in training and testing, or systems
that are designed for significant learning after deployment. One
approach to address this challenge is to implement standards or
principles guiding the development of AI systems. However, you
referenced AI more than 30 times in your testimony on Capitol Hill, and
many of those references were in different contexts. This seems to
imply Facebook has assumed a broad or vague definition of AI. I fear
that a vague definition will make it difficult to implement clear,
unambiguous standards or principles to guide the fair, safe, and secure
application of AI and algorithms.
What how does Facebook define AI?
How is Facebook currently working to build trust in its
usage of AI? Specifically, has your company developed a set of
principles to guide your development and use of AI systems? If
so, what are they? Please also provide details on how these
principles are being implemented.
How will these principles improve the transparency of
decision-making AI systems?
How will these principles prevent a system designed to learn
after deployment from developing unacceptable behavior over
time?
Answer. We are focused on both the technical and the ethical
aspects of artificial intelligence. We believe these two should go
hand-in-hand together in order to fulfill our commitment to being fair,
transparent and accountable in our development and use of AI. Facebook
has AI teams working on developing the philosophical, as well as
technical, foundations for this work. Facebook is also one of the co-
founders and members of the Partnership on AI (PAI), a collaborative
and multi-stakeholder organization established to study and formulate
best practices on AI technologies, to advance the public's
understanding of AI, and to serve as an open platform for discussion
and engagement about AI and its influences on people and society. The
thematic pillars that structure the work we're doing in the scope of
the PAI--safety, fairness, transparency and accountability--are the
principles that we believe industry should follow and promote when
building and deploying AI systems. The PAI's Fair, Transparent and
Accountable AI Working Group is also working alongside industry,
academia, and civil society to develop best practices around the
development and fielding of fair, explainable, and accountable AI
systems.
We believe that over the long term, building AI tools is the
scalable way to identify and root out most content that violates our
policies. We are making substantial investments in building and
improving these tools. We already use artificial intelligence to help
us identify threats of real world harm from terrorists and others. For
example, the use of AI and other automation to stop the spread of
terrorist content is showing promise. Today, 99 percent of the ISIS and
Al Qaeda related terror content we remove from Facebook is content we
detect before anyone in our community has flagged it to us, and in some
cases, before it goes live on the site. We do this primarily through
the use of automated systems like photo and video matching and text-
based machine learning. We also use AI to help find child exploitation
images, hate speech, discriminatory ads, and other prohibited content.
Question 2. Mr. Zuckerberg, you said recently that Facebook is more
like a government than a traditional company. Facebook is a community
of over 2 billion people from every country in the world. You have also
said you hope to grow the number of Facebook employees working on
security of the user community to 20,000 by the end of the year. A city
like Flint, Michigan has a population of 100,000 and roughly 100
uniformed police officers. Your company is aiming to have one cop on
the beat for every 100,000 of its 2 billion users.
Is this going to be adequate to prevent another misuse of
consumer data like we saw with Cambridge Analytica?
Answer. We are doubling the size of our security and content review
teams (from 10,000 to 20,000) over the course of this year. We
currently have approximately 15,000 people working on these teams.
Question 3. How are you making the efforts of these employees
transparent and accountable to your users?
Answer. We are taking significant steps to increase our
transparency. For example, we have published the internal guidelines we
use to enforce our Community Standards here: https://newsroom.fb.com/
news/2018/04/comprehensive-community-standards/. We decided to publish
these internal guidelines for two reasons. First, the guidelines will
help people understand where we draw the line on nuanced issues.
Second, providing these details makes it easier for everyone, including
experts in different fields, to give us feedback so that we can improve
the guidelines--and the decisions we make--over time.
We also recently publicized data around enforcement of our
Community Standards in a Community Standards Enforcement Report
(https://transparency.facebook
.com/community-standards-enforcement). The report details our
enforcement efforts between October 2017 to March 2018, and it covers
six areas: graphic violence, adult nudity and sexual activity,
terrorist propaganda, hate speech, spam, and fake accounts. The numbers
show you:
How much content people saw that violates our standards;
How much content we removed; and
How much content we detected proactively using our
technology--before people who use Facebook reported it.
The data we published is the same information we use to measure our
progress internally.
We believe this increased transparency will lead to increased
accountability and responsibility over time.
Question 4. Facebook has made some changes in light of the 2016
U.S. Presidential election and the fact that your platform allowed for
the proliferation of fake news. You've since developed tools that try
to tamp down on this activity--pulling down fake accounts and
destroying bots.
You have described the content on your platform during
elections held since 2016, both foreign and domestic, as
``cleaner''--but what metrics are you using to evaluate the
real effectiveness of the changes you have made?
Once you have a true understanding of the impact these tools
have--how can you communicate the changes to users so they can
be confident that what they are viewing is real and not there
for the purpose of manipulating them?
Consumers are skeptical of the content on your platform, how
can you gain back their trust?
Answer. We are working hard to regain the trust of our community.
Success would consist of minimizing or eliminating abuse of our
platform and keeping our community safe. We have a number of specific
goals that we will use to measure our progress in these efforts. First,
we are increasing the number of people working on safety and security
at Facebook, to 20,000. We have significantly expanded the number of
people who work specifically on election integrity, including people
who investigate this specific kind of abuse by foreign actors. Those
specialists find and remove more of these actors. Second, we work to
improve threat intelligence sharing across our industry, including, we
hope, by having other companies join us in formalizing these efforts.
This is a fight against sophisticated actors, and our entire industry
needs to work together to respond quickly and effectively. Third, we
are bringing greater transparency to election ads on Facebook by
requiring more disclosure from people who want to run election ads
about who is paying for the ads and by making it possible to see all of
the ads that an advertiser is running, regardless of the targeting. We
believe that these efforts will help to educate our community and to
arm users, media, civil society, and the government with information
that will make it easier to identify more sophisticated abuse to us and
to law enforcement.
We have gotten increasingly better at finding and disabling fake
accounts. We're now at the point that we block millions of fake
accounts each day at the point of creation before they do any harm.
We are taking steps to help users assess the content they see on
Facebook. For example, for ads with political content, we've created an
archive that will hold ads with political content for seven years--
including for information about ad impressions and spend, as well as
demographic data such as age, gender and location. People in Canada and
Ireland can already see all the ads that a Page is running on
Facebook--and we're launching this globally in June. Further,
advertisers will now need to confirm their ID and location before being
able to run any ads with political content in the U.S. All ads with
political content will also clearly state who paid for them. We also
want to empower people to decide for themselves what to read, trust,
and share. We promote news literacy and work to inform people with more
context. For example, if third-party fact-checkers write articles about
a news story, we show them immediately below the story in the Related
Articles unit. We also notify people and Page Admins if they try to
share a story, or have shared one in the past, that's been determined
to be false.
Question 5. How did Facebook, prior to the 2016 U.S. Presidential
election, identify and evaluate fake or troll accounts, and how have
your processes changed since then?
What steps are taken once Facebook has identified fake or
troll accounts and, specifically, how much of your response is
consumer-facing? Will a user ever truly know the extent to
which they were influenced by a fake account?
Answer. We continue to make improvements to our efforts to more
effectively detect and deactivate fake accounts to help reduce the
spread of spam, false news, and misinformation. We continually update
our technical systems to identify, checkpoint, and remove inauthentic
accounts, and we block millions of attempts to register fake accounts
every day. These systems examine thousands of detailed account
attributes and prioritize signals that are more difficult for bad
actors to disguise, such as their connections to others on our
platform. As with all security threats, we have been incorporating new
insights into our models for detecting fake accounts, including
information specific to election issues.
Question 6. Is it true that Facebook does not authenticate the
administrators of group and organization pages in the same manner it
authenticates individual accounts? Will you take a different approach
going forward?
Answer. We have announced that people who manage Pages with large
numbers of followers will need to be verified. Those who manage large
Pages that do not clear the process will no longer be able to post.
This will make it much harder for people to administer a Page using a
fake account, which is strictly against our policies. We will also show
users additional context about Pages to effectively assess their
content. For example, a user can see whether a Page has changed its
name.
Question 7. Current sector-specific privacy laws and state privacy
laws, as well as currently proposed Federal legislation that address
data privacy and security, often narrowly define personal information
to include identifiers like a person's name, social security number,
and bank information. But definitions of personal information currently
do not cover information like social media ``likes'' and certain
choices and activities online that bad actors have at worst used to
manipulate voters and at best used to deliver targeted advertisements.
What do you think Cambridge Analytica has taught us about
what should be considered personal information?
Should definitions of personal information be updated to
include an individual's activities like search activity and
social media ``likes''?
Answer. Facebook is generally not opposed to regulation but wants
to ensure it is the right regulation. The issues facing the industry
are complex, multi-faceted, and affect an important part of peoples'
lives. As such, Facebook is absolutely committed to working with
regulators, like Congress, to craft the right regulations. Facebook
would be happy to review any proposed legislation and provide comments.
Question 8. Who do you consider to be Facebook's customers (i.e.,
what stakeholders directly provide Facebook with revenue)? To the
extent that the customers are not the end users of the platform, how
will Facebook reconcile the privacy expectations and interests of both
sets of stakeholders?
Answer. In the words of Facebook CEO and Founder Mark Zuckerberg,
``Facebook is an idealistic and optimistic company. For most of our
existence, we focused on all the good that connecting people can bring.
As Facebook has grown, people everywhere have gotten a powerful new
tool to stay connected to the people they love, make their voices
heard, and build communities and businesses.'' Our product is social
media--the ability to connect users with the people that matter to
them, wherever they are in the world. It's the same with a free search
engine, website or newspaper. The core product is reading the news or
finding information--and the ads exist to fund that experience. Our
priority is protecting our community, and that is more important than
maximizing our profits.
Question 9. Does Facebook intend to provide its users with a
comprehensive listing of all apps and services that have accessed their
Facebook data? In such a listing, would Facebook include information
about which data points were accessed, when they were accessed, and how
they were accessed?
Answer. Facebook allows people to view, manage, and remove the apps
that they have logged into with Facebook through the App Dashboard. We
recently prompted everyone to review their App Dashboard as a part of a
Privacy Checkup, and we also provided an educational notice on Facebook
to encourage people to review their settings. More information about
how users can manage their app settings is available at https://
www.facebook.com/help/218345114850283?helpref=aboutcontent.
The categories of information that an app can access is clearly
disclosed before the user consents to use an app on Facebook platform.
Users can view and edit the categories of information that apps they
have used have access to through the App Dashboard.
Question 10. What mechanisms does Facebook have in place to monitor
third parties who have access to user data once the data is delivered?
If a user deletes their data on Facebook, how does Facebook ensure that
third parties with access to their data have also deleted it?
Answer. We use a variety of tools to enforce Facebook policies
against violating parties, including developers. We review tens of
thousands of apps per year. With the exception of Account Information
(name, e-mail, gender, birthday, current city, and profile picture
URL), apps may maintain user data obtained from us only for as long as
necessary for their business purpose and must delete the information if
they stop using the Facebook Platform. Further, developers are required
to keep the data maintained on their systems up to date.
Question 11. What mechanisms--beyond self-reporting--are currently
in place, or will be in place in the future, to enable independent
academic and journalistic validation of Facebook's current and future
claims that the platform has removed bad actors who have abused or
compromised user data and privacy?
Answer. App Review. We have large teams of internal and external
experts working hard to investigate these apps as quickly as possible.
To date, thousands of apps have been investigated and around 200 (from
a handful of developers) have been suspended--pending a thorough
investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data.
The App Review process introduced in 2014 requires developers who
create an app that asks for more than certain basic user information
from installers to justify the data they are looking to collect and how
they are going to use it. Facebook then reviews whether the developer
has a legitimate need for the data in light of how the app functions.
Only if it is approved following such review can the app ask for users'
permission to get their data. Facebook has rejected more than half of
the apps submitted for App Review between April 2014 and April 2018.
New Developer Requirements. We are in the process of investigating
every app that had access to a large amount of information before we
changed our Platform in 2014. If we find suspicious activity, we will
take immediate steps to investigate (including a full forensic audit)
or take enforcement actions against the app. If we determine that there
has been improper use of data, we will ban those developers and notify
everyone affected. Facebook is launching the Data Abuse Bounty to
reward people who report any misuse of data by app developers. The Data
Abuse Bounty, inspired by the existing bug bounty program that we use
to uncover and address security issues, will help us identify
violations of our policies.
Further, Facebook's Platform Policy makes clear to app developers
the relevant requirements regarding users' privacy that apply to apps
operating on the Platform, including the requirements to give users
choice and control, and to respect user privacy. Application developers
explicitly agree to Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities
and Platform Policy when they set up their Facebook accounts. The
Platform Policy imposes a variety of obligations on app developers
regarding the features, functionality, data collection and usage, and
content for apps on the Platform, as well as Facebook's right to take
enforcement action if an application violates the Platform Policy.
Clear History. We have also worked with regulators, legislators,
and privacy experts on updates that make data settings and tools easier
to find. For example, we recently announced plans to build Clear
History. This feature will enable users to see the websites and apps
that send us information when they use them, delete this information
from their accounts, and turn off our ability to store it associated
with their accounts going forward. When developing tools such as Clear
History, we will work with privacy advocates, academics, policymakers,
and regulators to get their input on our approach, including how we
plan to remove identifying information and the rare cases where we need
information for security purposes. We've already started a series of
roundtables in cities around the world, and heard specific demands for
controls like these at a session we held at our headquarters two weeks
ago. We're looking forward to doing more.
Measuring Misinformation Through Academic Commission. In April,
Facebook also announced a new initiative to help provide independent
research about the role of social media in elections, as well as
democracy more generally. In the coming weeks, the commission will lead
a request for proposals to measure the volume and effects of
misinformation on Facebook. They will then manage a peer review process
to select which scholars will receive funding for their research, and
access to privacy-protected data sets from Facebook. This will help
keep us accountable and track our progress over time.
Elections. We know that outside experts, researchers, and academics
can also help by analyzing political advertising on Facebook. It's why
we're working closely with our newly-formed Election Commission and
other stakeholders to launch an API for the archive of ads with
political content. We also recognize that news coverage of elections
and important issues is distinct from advocacy or electoral ads, even
if those news stories receive paid distribution on Facebook. We're
working closely with news partners and are committed to updating the
archive to help differentiate between news and non-news content.
Question 12. Well, you bring up the principles because, as you are
well aware, AI systems, especially in very complex environments when
you have machine learning, it is sometimes very difficult to
understand, as you mentioned, exactly how those decisions were arrived
at. There are examples of how decisions are made on a discriminatory
basis and that they can compound if you are not very careful about how
that occurs. And so is your company--you mentioned principles. Is your
company developing a set of principles that are going to guide that
development? And would you provide details to us as to what those
principles are and how they will help deal with this issue?
Answer. We are focused on both the technical and the ethical
aspects of artificial intelligence. We believe these two should go
hand-in-hand together in order to fulfill our commitment to being fair,
transparent, and accountable in our development and use of AI. Facebook
has AI teams working on developing the philosophical, as well as
technical, foundations for this work. Facebook is also one of the co-
founders and members of the Partnership on AI (PAI), a collaborative
and multi-stakeholder organization established to study and formulate
best practices on AI technologies, to advance the public's

and engagement about AI and its influences on people and society. The
thematic pillars that structure the work we're doing in the scope of
the PAI--safety, fairness, transparency, and accountability--are the
principles that we believe industry should follow and promote when
building and deploying AI systems. The PAI's Fair, Transparent and
Accountable AI Working Group is also working alongside industry,
academia, and civil society to develop best practices around the
development and fielding of fair, explainable, and accountable AI
systems.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tammy Baldwin to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. Do you know whether Aleksandr Kogan sold any of the
data he collected to anyone other than Cambridge Analytica?
Answer. Kogan represented to us that he provided data to SCL,
Eunoia Technologies (a company founded by Christopher Wylie), and a
researcher at the Toronto Laboratory for Social Neuroscience at the
University of Toronto. He represented to Facebook that he only received
payment from SCL/Cambridge Analytica.
Question 2. How much do you know or have you tried to find out how
Cambridge Analytica used the data while they had it before you believed
they deleted it?
Answer. On December 11, 2015, The Guardian published an article
reporting that Kogan and his company, GSR, may have passed information
his app had obtained from Facebook users to SCL Elections Ltd. (SCL)/
Cambridge Analytica. By doing so, Kogan and his company violated
Facebook's Platform Policies, which explicitly prohibited selling or
licensing user data accessed from Facebook and from sharing any user
data accessed from Facebook with any ad network, data broker or other
advertising or monetization-related service. For this reason, Facebook
immediately banned his app from our platform and launched an
investigation into these allegations. Kogan signed a certification
declaring that he had deleted all data that he obtained through his app
and obtained certifications of deletion from others he had shared data
with, including Cambridge Analytica. In March 2018, new allegations
surfaced that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted data as it had
represented. Our investigation of these matters is ongoing.
Question 3. I find some encouragement in the steps you have
outlined today to provide greater transparency regarding political ads.
I want to get further information on how you can be confident that you
have excluded entities based outside of the United States.
Answer. Pursuant to the new transparency measures Facebook is
launching, all advertisers who want to run ads with political content
targeted at the U.S. will have to confirm their identity and location
by providing either a U.S. driver's license or passport, last four
digits of their social security number, and a residential mailing
address. In addition, people who manage Pages with large numbers of
followers will need to be verified. Those who manage large Pages that
do not clear the process will no longer be able to post.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. According to the New York Times and other media
outlets, fair housing advocates recently filed a lawsuit in Federal
court arguing that ``Facebook continues to discriminate against certain
groups, including women, disabled veterans and single mothers, in the
way that it allows advertisers to target the audience for their ads.''
Despite repeated announcements by Facebook suggesting that your company
will remedy this disturbing practice, third-party organizations have
tested your platform repeatedly to exclude certain minorities.
Unfortunately, many of these tests of your platform were successful and
this issue has been known to Facebook for several years.
Please explain in detail why Facebook provided housing advertisers
with targeting options to exclude users based on ``ethnic affinity'' in
clear violation of Federal law. Following third-party demonstrations of
how a housing advertiser could unlawfully use Facebook to discriminate
against certain protected classes of housing customers, please describe
in detail the specific actions Facebook took to end the practice and
make sure that Facebook's user tools actually reflect Facebook's
written policies that claim to prohibit using Facebook's targeting
options to discriminate. As Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
please describe how you personally responded to the public reports
demonstrating that Facebook's targeting options had enabled unlawful
discrimination in housing. Please provide any company documents, in
hard copy or electronic form, addressing the implementation of Facebook
advertising targeting options and any associated risk that such an
option could result in violations of Federal legal prohibitions against
discrimination in housing. If Facebook has no such documents, please
provide a detailed justification as to why the company did not, or does
not, have a compliance protocol or office dedicated to enforcing Fair
Housing laws.
Answer. We want our advertising tools to help promote inclusion and
diversity of all kinds. Discrimination has no place on Facebook, and we
make this clear to advertisers in a number of ways. Everyone on
Facebook must agree to our Terms when they sign up to use our service.
In so doing, they agree not to engage in discriminatory conduct on
Facebook. In addition, our Advertising Policies (available at https://
www.facebook.com/policies/ads/) include an explicit and detailed anti-
discrimination policy that prohibits discriminatory ads or the use of
our audience selection tools for discriminatory purposes.
In late 2016, we began building machine learning tools (called
``classifiers'') that were intended to automatically identify, at the
point of creation, advertisements offering housing, employment or
credit opportunities (referred to here generally as ``housing,
employment and credit ads''). We built these classifiers so that when
we identified one of these kinds of ads, we could: (1) prevent the use
of our ``multicultural affinity'' targeting options in connection with
the ad, and (2) for the use of any other kind of targeting, require
that the advertiser certify compliance with our anti-discrimination
policy and applicable anti-discrimination laws.
We trained the classifiers before we launched them, including by
using search terms provided by your office in January 2017. After the
classifiers launched in approximately February 2017, we anticipated
that, through machine learning, they would become better over time at
distinguishing ads offering housing, employment, or credit
opportunities from other types of ads. We also expected that we would
receive feedback about the performance of the tool that would enable us
to detect problems and improve the classifiers over time.
In practice, the classifiers did not improve over time as much as
we had anticipated. Rather, they became both over- and under-inclusive,
identifying and requiring self-certification for hundreds of thousands
of ads each day that may have had nothing to do with housing,
employment, or credit offers, while missing ads that may have contained
such offers.
There were two principal reasons for this failure. First, a key
aspect of our ad-review process involves the random sampling of ads
that are live on Facebook for the purpose of reassessing those ads'
compliance with our Advertising Policies. When we identify ads that
should have been flagged as being in violation of our policies, we use
that information to improve our review processes, including our machine
learning classifiers. In hindsight, our training set was not
sufficiently comprehensive and did not include an evolving set of
housing, credit and employment ads that should have been flagged by our
classifiers to better train our models. We also failed to fully account
for the lack of feedback we would likely receive about the performance
of these classifiers through other channels--feedback we typically rely
on to alert us to performance issues. For example, advertisers whose
ads should have been (but were not) identified through this process
would have had no reason to report a problem.
We take these limitations very seriously, and we regret that they
prevented us from providing the oversight we had hoped to provide.
Since they were brought to our attention in November 2017, we have
taken significant steps to remedy them. These steps include the
following:
We have integrated all of the classifiers and targeting
prohibitions into the random sampling process we use to gather
feedback about the performance of our ad review processes.
We are adding more than 1,000 people to our global ads
review teams over the next year to allow for more human review
of the ads placed on our platform.
We have built teams whose role it is to pressure test our
policy-enforcement products to identify potential performance
issues.
In addition to addressing the issues with housing, employment and
credit classifiers to more accurately identify such ads, as of January
2018, we have implemented the following additional changes with regard
to multicultural affinity targeting more generally:
We disabled the use of multicultural affinity exclusion
targeting for all ads; this prohibition is no longer limited to
housing, employment and credit ads.
We now require self-certification of compliance with our
anti-discrimination policies and applicable anti-discrimination
laws for any use of multicultural affinity targeting,
regardless of the type of ad.
We have undertaken a review of our ad-targeting tools
generally, with an eye toward identifying the potential for the
tools to be abused.
As a result of that review, we disabled the use of other
exclusion targeting categories that we determined, on their
face, may have been misunderstood to identify a group of
Facebook users based on race, color, national origin or
ancestry.
Question 2. What is Facebook doing to protect Veterans, women and
other minorities to ensure that advertisements on your platform do not
discriminate against them in possible violation of Federal laws? Is
Facebook aware of an investigation by the U.S. Department of Housing
and Urban Development regarding these issues and is Facebook
cooperating with an investigation? When were you alerted that an
investigation(s) had begun? Do you believe that violators of Federal
laws prohibiting discrimination, such as the protections contained in
the Fair Housing Act, should be held accountable?
Answer. Discriminatory advertising has no place on Facebook's
platform and Facebook removes such content as soon as it becomes aware
of it. Facebook's policies prohibit advertisers from discriminating
against people on personal attributes such as race, ethnicity, color,
national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity, family status, disability, and medical or genetic conditions.
Facebook educates advertisers on our anti-discrimination policy, and in
some cases, requires the advertisers to certify compliance with
Facebook's anti-discrimination policy and anti-discrimination laws.
Facebook also uses machine learning to help identify ads that offer
housing, employment, or credit opportunities. When an advertiser
attempts to show an ad that Facebook identifies as offering a housing,
employment, or credit opportunity and includes Facebook's multicultural
advertising segments, Facebook will disapprove the ad. Facebook also
requires advertisers to certify that they are complying with Facebook's
updated anti-discrimination policy and anti-discrimination laws when
the advertiser attempts to show a housing, employment, or credit
opportunity and uses any other audience segment on Facebook.
Facebook has been actively engaged with the U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development (HUD) since at least the Fall of 2016. As
part of the engagement, Facebook has focused on addressing the concern
that advertisers may seek to engage in discriminatory advertising on
Facebook's platform. In connection with this engagement, Facebook has
made numerous modifications and improvements to its ad policies,
practices, and tools.
Question 3. I'm glad to hear that Facebook plans to extend the
European Union's General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) to U.S.
users. By what date does Facebook plan on extending those protections
to U.S. users? In doing so, is Facebook affirming that all data
generated by a user is the property of that user and is subject to
protections outlined in the General Data Protection Regulations,
including rights to access, rectification, erasure, data portability,
among others?
Answer. We confirm that we provide the same tools for access,
rectification, erasure, data portability and others to people in the
U.S. (and globally) that we provide in the European Union, and many of
those tools (like our Download Your Information tool, Ad Preferences
tool, and Activity Log) have been available globally for many years. We
have recently begun providing direct notice of these controls and our
updated terms of service to people around the world (including in the
U.S.), allowing people to choose whether or not to enable or disable
these settings or to consent to our updated terms. The controls and
settings that Facebook is enabling as part of GDPR are available to
people around the world, including settings for controlling our use of
face recognition on Facebook and for controlling our ability to use
data we collect off Facebook Company Products to target ads.
Question 4. The European Union's deadline for full implementation
of their General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) is May 25, 2018.
While you have said publically that Facebook plans to extend General
Data Protection Regulations (GDPR) across its platform ``in spirit,''
including to users in the U.S., recent media reporting suggests that
Facebook's commitment to GDPR implementation across its platform is
questionable. In your view, what does implementation of GDPR ``in
spirit'' mean? If Facebook were to be found violating GDPR protections
for non-European Union users, what recourse do those users have, legal
or otherwise, to remedy a complaint?
Answer. As a part of our overall approach to privacy, we are
providing the same tools for access, rectification, erasure, data
portability and others to people in the U.S. (and globally) that we
provide in the European Union under the GDPR. The controls and settings
that Facebook is enabling as part of GDPR include settings for
controlling our use of face recognition on Facebook and for controlling
our ability to use data we collect off Facebook Company Products to
target ads. We recently began providing direct notice of these controls
and our updated terms to people around the world (including in the
U.S.), allowing people to choose whether or not to enable or disable
these settings or to consent to our updated terms. Many of these tools
(like our Download Your Information tool, ad preferences tool, and
Activity Log) have been available globally for many years.
The substantive protections in our user agreements offered by
Facebook Ireland and Facebook, Inc. are the same. However, there are
certain aspects of our Facebook Ireland Data Policy that are specific
to legal requirements in the GDPR--such as the requirement that we
provide contact information for our EU Data Protection Officer or that
we identify the ``legal bases'' we use for processing data under the
GDPR. Likewise, our Facebook Ireland terms and Data Policy address the
lawful basis for transferring data outside the EU, based on legal
instruments that are applicable only to the EU. And other provisions of
the GDPR itself pertain to interactions between European regulators and
other matters that are not relevant to people located outside of the
EU.
Facebook is subject to ongoing oversight by the Federal Trade
Commission with respect to its privacy commitments to people and its
implementation of privacy settings, under a Consent Order with the FTC.
Facebook is subject to the authority of the Irish Data Protection
Commissioner, its lead regulator, under the GDPR in the European Union.
Question 5. As reported by Politico on April 17, 2018, Facebook has
enlisted the help of conservative organizations to push back against
GDPR and other potential regulatory efforts in the U.S. Is Facebook
coordinating with political organizations to consider or address
potential state or Federal regulatory actions?
Answer. When the GDPR was finalized, we realized it was an
opportunity to invest even more heavily in privacy. We not only wanted
to comply with the law, but also go beyond our obligations to build new
and improved privacy experiences for everyone on Facebook. To that end,
as we often do, we sought feedback from people with a variety of
perspectives on privacy, including people who use our services,
regulators and government officials, privacy and policy experts, and
designers. We are applying the same protections, controls, and
transparency to people in the U.S. and around the world that we are
providing to people in Europe under GDPR.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Maggie Hassan to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. During the hearing, you stated that you ``don't know''
whether Facebook employees actively coordinated with Cambridge
Analytica as a result of the support Facebook provided directly to the
Trump campaign. Representatives from the Trump campaign have
extensively detailed how Facebook provided ``hands-on'' support to the
campaign, embedding Facebook employees at the campaign's digital
operation center in San Antonio.\5\ Cambridge Analytica appears to have
had employees nearby, in the same office, at the same time that
Facebook employees were embedded there.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ https://qz.com/1233579/facebook-and-cambridge-analytica-worked-
side-by-side-at-a-trump-campaign-office-insan-antonio/
Was Facebook aware that Cambridge Analytica personnel would
be working out of the same Trump campaign office before
Facebook agreed to provide support to the campaign at this
location? If not, when did someone at Facebook become aware,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
and what disclosure process was followed internally?
Would Facebook have still provided support if it knew
beforehand that it would be working alongside Cambridge
Analytica? Once Facebook found out it would be working
alongside Cambridge Analytica, what actions did Facebook take?
Have you conducted an internal investigation into the
vetting process behind this arrangement with the Trump
campaign?
Answer. While no one from Facebook was assigned full-time to the
Trump campaign, Facebook employees did interact with Cambridge
Analytica employees. While our investigation is ongoing, our review
indicates that Facebook employees did not identify any issues involving
the improper use of Facebook data in the course of their interactions
with Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign.
In general, political data firms working on the 2016 campaign had
access to Facebook's advertising support services, including technical
support, and best practices guidance on how to optimize their use of
Facebook. Everyone had access to the same tools, which are the same
tools that every campaign is offered.
Question 2. You stated that Facebook only collected text/call data
when people opted-in from Facebook Messenger. Some reports \6\ seem to
contradict that, with users who reportedly did not download the
Messenger app onto a given device seeing their message data from those
devices in their Facebook files. Can you clarify this discrepancy?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/03/
facebook-scraped-call-text-message-data-for-years-fromandroid-phones/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You also stated that this was done to improve the user experience.
Can you explain why it would be necessary to collect not only the
contact data from a user's phone, but also the date, time, and length
of calls and store that data for years?
Answer. Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature
that lets people import contact information to help them connect with
people they know on Facebook and Messenger. We introduced the call and
text history component of this feature for Android users several years
ago, and currently offer it in Messenger and Facebook Lite, a
lightweight version of Facebook, on Android.
Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and serve as
a way to more easily find the people users want to connect with. They
help users find and stay connected with the people they care about and
provide them with a better experience across Facebook.
Before we receive call and text history from people, they
specifically grant us permission to access this data on their device
and separately agree to use the feature. If, at any time, they no
longer wish to use this feature they can turn it off, and all
previously shared call and text history shared via that app is deleted.
People can also access information they previously imported through the
Download Your Information tool.
We've reviewed this feature to confirm that Facebook does not
collect the content of messages--and will delete all logs older than
one year. In the future, people will only upload to our servers the
information needed to offer this feature--not broader data such as the
time of calls.
Question 3. You stated that information sent via WhatsApp is not
seen or collected by Facebook, and is never used to inform
advertisements. WhatsApp features end-to-end encryption, meaning
Facebook has no access to those messages. But other Facebook services
such as Messenger or messages on Instagram are not encrypted this way,
meaning Facebook does have access to them. Are the content of messages
sent through Facebook Messenger or Instagram ever used, or have they
ever been used, to inform the placement of advertisements?
Answer. Facebook does not analyze the content of photos or text in
users' posts or messages to target ads to them using AI or otherwise.
Instead, there are a few primary ways that we personalize the ads and
sponsored content for people on Facebook, based on:
Information from people's use of Facebook. When people use
Facebook, they can choose to share things about themselves like
their age, gender, hometown, or interests. They can also click
or like posts, Pages, or articles. We use this information to
understand what users might be interested in and hopefully show
them ads that are relevant. If a bike shop comes to Facebook
wanting to reach female cyclists in Atlanta, we can show their
ad to women in Atlanta who liked a Page about bikes. People can
always see the ``interests'' assigned to them in their ad
preferences, and if they want, remove them.
Information that an advertiser shares with us (or ``custom
audiences''). In this case, advertisers bring us the customer
information so they can reach those people on Facebook. These
advertisers might have people's e-mail address from a purchase
users made, or from some other data source. If we have matching
e-mail addresses, we can show those people ads from that
advertiser (although we cannot see the e-mail addresses which
are sent to us in hashed form, and these are deleted as soon as
we complete the match). In ad preferences people can see which
advertisers with their contact information are currently
running campaigns--and they can click the top right corner of
any ad to hide all ads from that business.
Information that websites and apps send to Facebook. Some of
the websites and apps people visit may use Facebook tools to
make their content and ads more relevant, if people consent to
let Facebook show them ads based on data from third-party
partners. For example, if an online retailer is using Facebook
Pixel, they can ask Facebook to show ads to people who looked
at a certain style of shoe or put a pair of shoes into their
shopping cart. If users don't want this data used to show them
ads, they can turn it off in ad preferences.
Facebook also offers Lookalike Audiences. Advertisers
creating a Lookalike Audience choose a source audience (which
could include a custom audience as described above, people who
have opened or completed a form in lead ads on Facebook, people
who have interacted with the advertiser's Facebook page or its
Instagram profile). Facebook then identifies common qualities
of the people in the source audience (e.g., demographic
information or information about their interests), and then
identifies people who are similar to them (on the basis of the
common signals identified in the source audience), without
sharing this information with the advertiser.
Question 4. What research have you done relating to users'
understanding of your policies and/or procedures relating to privacy
and/or security of user data?
Answer. We do extensive research around our privacy controls,
including focus-groups and on-platform surveys. Our research
overwhelmingly demonstrates that, while ``up front'' information like
that contained in the terms of service are useful, in-product controls
and education are the most meaningful to people and the most likely to
be read and understood. On-demand controls are also important, and we
recently redesigned our entire settings menu on mobile devices from top
to bottom to make things easier to find. We also created a new Privacy
Shortcuts, a menu where people can control their data in just a few
taps, with clearer explanations of how our controls work. The
experience is now clearer, more visual, and easy-to-find.
Improving people's understanding of how digital services work is an
industry-wide challenge that we are highly committed to addressing.
That's why, over the last 18 months, we've run a global series of
design workshops called ``Design Jams'', bringing together experts in
design, privacy, law, and computer science to work collaboratively on
new and innovative approaches. These workshops have run in Paris,
London, Dublin, Berlin, Sao Paolo, Hong Kong, and other cities, and
included global regulators and policymakers. At these workshops, expert
teams use ``people centric design'' methods to create innovative new
design prototypes and experiences to improve transparency and education
in digital services. These workshops inform Facebook's constantly-
improving approach.
In recognition of the need for improved approaches to data
transparency across all digital services, working with partners from
academia, design, and industry we recently launched TTC Labs, a design
innovation lab that seeks to improve user experiences around personal
data. TTC Labs is an open platform for sharing and innovation and
contains insights from leading experts in academia, design, and law, in
addition to prototype designs from the Design Jams, template services
and open-source toolkits for people-centric design for transparency,
trust and control of data. Working collaboratively, and based on open-
source approaches, TTC Labs seeks to pioneer new and more people-
centric best practices for people to understand how their data is used
by digital services, in ways that they find easy to understand and
control.
Facebook is highly committed to improving people's experience of
its own services as well as in to support improvements across the
industry.
Question 5. What percentage of users change their default privacy
settings?
Answer. There is no single number that measures how much time
people spend understanding how Facebook services work, in large part
because Facebook seeks, as much as possible, to put controls and
information in context within its service.
We've heard loud and clear that privacy settings and other
important tools are hard to find and that we must do more to keep
people informed. So, we're taking additional steps to put people more
in control of their privacy. For instance, we redesigned our entire
settings menu on mobile devices from top to bottom to make things
easier to find. We also created a new Privacy Shortcuts in a menu where
users can control their data in just a few taps, with clearer
explanations of how our controls work. The experience is now clearer,
more visual, and easy-to-find. Furthermore, we also updated our terms
of service that include our commitments to everyone using Facebook. We
explain the services we offer in language that's easier to read. We
also updated our Data Policy to better spell out what data we collect
and how we use it in Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and other
products.
Question 6. What types of data or information does Facebook collect
and store about non-Facebook users? For what purpose does Facebook
collect this data and information?
Answer. When people visit apps or websites that feature our
technologies--like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers
automatically log (i) standard browser or app records of the fact that
a particular device or user visited the website or app (this connection
to Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a
website or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button,
and is an inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any
additional information the publisher of the app or website chooses to
share with Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as
the fact that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard
feature of the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same
information with multiple different third-parties whenever people visit
their website or app. For example, the House Energy and Commerce
Committee's website shares information with Google Analytics to help
improve the site. This means that, when a person visits the Committee's
website, it sends browser information about their visit to that party.
More information about how this works is available at https://
newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for this
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us--
described above--in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First,
these logs are critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to
detecting or preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser
has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign
the device might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a
potentially inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to
register for an account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide
summaries and insights to websites and apps about how many people visit
or use their product or use specific features like our Like button--but
without providing any information about a specific person. We do not
create profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use browser and app
logs for non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from our advertisers
to them or otherwise seek to personalize the content they see. However,
we may take the opportunity to show a general ad that is unrelated to
the attributes of the person or an ad encouraging the non-user to sign
up for Facebook.
We do receive some information from devices and browsers that may
be used by non-users. For example:
We also may receive information about the device of a non-
registered user if that user visits a part of Facebook that
does not require people to log in--such as a public Facebook
Page. The information we log when people visit our websites or
apps is the same as described above and is the same information
that any provider of an online service would receive.
In addition, Facebook may receive some basic information
about devices where Facebook apps are installed, including
before people using those devices have registered for Facebook
(such as when a user downloads a Facebook app, but has not yet
created an account, or if the app is preloaded on a given
device). This device data includes things like device model,
operating system, IP address, app version and device
identifiers. We use this information to provide the right
version of the app, help people who want to create accounts
(for example, optimizing the registration flow for the specific
device), retrieving bug fixes and measuring and improving app
performance. We do not use this information to build profiles
about non-registered users.
Question 7. Some reports have indicated that private messages sent
via Facebook may have been accessible to Cambridge Analytica and other
third party developers via the first version of the Graph API.\7\ Is
there merit to those reports? If so, how many users' private messages
would have been available through this mechanism?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ https://medium.com/tow-center/the-graph-api-key-points-in-the-
facebook-and-cambridge-analytica-debacle-b69fe692d747
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. At the outset, we do not know what data Kogan may have
shared with Cambridge Analytica. Our investigation into these matters
is ongoing, and we are paused on investigating Cambridge Analytica
directly (or conducting a forensic audit of its systems) due to the
request of the UK Information Commissioner's Office, which is
separately investigating Cambridge Analytica, a UK entity. The best
information to date also suggests only U.S. user data was shared by
Kogan with Cambridge Analytica.
Approximately 300,000 Facebook users worldwide installed Kogan's
app. For the majority of these users, the app requested consent to
access the following data fields associated with the user and with the
friends of the user: Public profile data, including name and gender;
Birthdate; ``Current city'' in the ``About'' section of the user's
profile, if provided; and Facebook Pages liked.
For a small subset of users, it appears that the app also requested
consent to access users' Facebook messages (fewer than 1,500
individuals, based on current information) and to posts that appeared
in the user's News Feed or Timeline (approximately 100 individuals,
based on current information)--but only for users who installed the
app. For a small subset of users (fewer than 1,500 individuals, based
on current information), it appears that the app also requested consent
to access the hometowns that the users' friends had specified in the
``About'' section of their profiles. And for a handful of people (fewer
than 10) who appear to be associated with Kogan/GSR, the app requested
consent to e-mail address and photos.
Question 8. What steps is Facebook taking to combat the opioid
crisis (such as efforts to crack down on the sale of illicit drugs or
identify users at risk of addiction)?
Answer. Thank you for highlighting this important issue. We have an
iterative, proactive process to help prevent opportunities for--and
respond quickly to--illicit drug sales on our platforms:
Our Community Standards make it very clear that buying,
selling or trading non-medical or pharmaceutical drugs is not
allowed on Facebook. Any time we become aware of content on
Facebook that is facilitating activity like drug sales, we
remove it and have taken numerous measures to minimize the
opportunity for these activities to take place on our platform.
We make it easy for people to flag content for us so that we
can quickly review and remove it if it violates. That's why
people can report any piece of content on Facebook--profiles,
Pages, Groups, individual content and even comments.
If we identify violating content, we are able to look for
associated profiles, Pages, groups, and accounts and remove
them.
We have also made it harder for people to find content that
facilitates the sale of opioids on our platform.
We have removed content that violated our policies that was
surfaced in Search.
We have blocked hundreds of terms associated with drugs
sales from being able to surface results on Facebook or only
returning links to news about drugs shared for awareness.
We have removed thousands of terms from being suggested in
search--meaning that our systems won't recognize the beginning
of the word as it is being typed and suggest what the completed
term to search is.
We continue to look for ways to get faster at finding and
removing this content, working across our policy, operations,
product, and partnerships team. We also update our detection
methods as bad actors work to game the system and bypass our
safeguards.
We recently launched a new feature on Facebook so that now, when
people search for help with opioid misuse--as well as attempt to buy
opioids--they are prompted with content at the top of the search
results page that will ask them if they would like help finding free
and confidential treatment referrals. This will then direct them to the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration National
Helpline.
The same resources will be available on Instagram in the coming
weeks. This is one of a number of ways we are helping connect people
with resources and communities to support them.
Question 9. What process does Facebook use to vet third parties
before granting them access to user data?
Answer. In April 2014, we announced that we would more tightly
restrict our platform APIs to prevent abuse. At that time, we made
clear that existing apps would have a year to transition--at which
point they would be forced (1) to migrate to the more restricted API
and (2) be subject to Facebook's new review and approval protocols. The
vast majority of companies were required to make the changes by May
2015; a small number of companies (fewer than 100) were given a one-
time extension of less than six months beyond May 2015 to come into
compliance. (One company received an extension to January 2016.) In
addition, in the context of our ongoing review of third-party apps, we
discovered a very small number of companies (fewer than 10) that
theoretically could have accessed limited friends' data as a result of
API access that they received in the context of a beta test. We are not
aware that any of this handful of companies used this access, and we
have now revoked any technical capability they may have had to access
any friends' data.
New apps that launched after April 30, 2014 were required to use
our more restrictive platform APIs. We required apps seeking additional
categories of data to undergo proactive review by our internal teams.
We rejected more than half of the apps seeking these permissions,
including the second version of Kogan's app.
We review apps to ensure that the requested permissions clearly
improve the user experience and that the data obtained is tied to an
experience within the app. We conduct a variety of manual and automated
checks of applications on the platform for Policy compliance, as well
as random sampling. When we find evidence of or receive allegations of
violations, we investigate and, where appropriate, employ a number of
measures, including restricting applications from our platform,
preventing developers from building on our platform in the future, and
taking legal action where appropriate.
Recently, we announced a number of additional steps we're taking to
address concerns raised by Kogan's app.
Review our platform. We will investigate all apps that had
access to large amounts of data before the platform changes we
announced in 2014, and we will audit any app where we identify
suspicious activity. If we identify misuses of data, we'll take
immediate action, including banning the app from our platform
and pursuing legal action if appropriate.
Tell people about data misuse. We will tell people about
apps that have misused their data. This includes building a way
for people to know if their data might have been accessed via
the app. Moving forward, if we remove an app for misusing data,
we will tell everyone who used it.
Turn off access for unused apps. If someone has not used an
app within the last three months, we will turn off the app's
access to their data.
Restrict Facebook Login data. We are changing Login, so that
the only data that an app can request without app review will
include name, profile photo, and e-mail address. Requesting any
other data will require approval from Facebook. We will also no
longer allow apps to ask for access to information like
religious or political views, relationship status and details,
custom friends lists, education and work history, fitness
activity, book reading and music listening activity, news
reading, video watch activity, and games activity. We will
encourage people to manage the apps they use. We already show
people what apps their accounts are connected to and allow them
to control what data they've permitted those apps to use. But
we're making it easier for people to see what apps they use and
the information they have shared with those apps.
Reward people who find vulnerabilities. We launched the Data
Abuse Bounty program so that people can report to us any
misuses of data by app developers.
Update our policies. We have updated our terms and Data
Policy to explain how we use data and how data is shared with
app developers.
Question 10. What steps does Facebook take to monitor third parties
who have access to user data?
Answer. See Response to Question 9.
Question 11. Which third parties have improperly accessed or
inappropriately used user data, or violated signed agreements with
Facebook regarding data? What steps has Facebook taken to remedy these
events?
Answer. Facebook is in the process of investigating all the apps
that had access to large amounts of information, such as extensive
friends data (if those friends privacy data settings allowed sharing),
before we changed our platform policies in 2014--significantly reducing
the data apps could access. Where we have concerns about individual
apps, we are investigating them--and any app that either refuses or
fails an audit will be banned from Facebook. As of early June 2018,
thousands of apps have been investigated and around 200 have been
suspended--pending a thorough investigation into whether they did in
fact misuse any data.
These apps relate to a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You,
the Cambridge Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality, with many of the
suspended apps being affiliated with the same entity. Many of these
apps also appear to be ``test'' apps that were never released to the
public, and therefore would not have acquired significant user data,
although our investigation into these apps is ongoing.
Question 12. You stated that Facebook is an ``idealistic company.''
Facebook has reportedly sought to build a censorship-friendly app to
help enter the Chinese market.\8\ Are those reports true? If so, do you
consider those actions to be consistent with Facebook's idealism?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/22/technology/facebook-
censorship-tool-china.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. Because Facebook has been blocked in China since 2009, we
are not in a position to know exactly how the government would seek to
apply its laws and regulations on content were we permitted to offer
our service to Chinese users. Since 2013, Facebook has been a member of
the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a multi-stakeholder digital rights
initiative. As part of our membership, Facebook has committed to the
freedom of expression and privacy standards set out in the GNI
Principles--which are in turn based on the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights--and we are independently assessed on our compliance with
these standards on a biennial basis.
In keeping with these commitments, rigorous human rights due
diligence and careful consideration of free expression and privacy
implications would constitute important components of any decision on
entering China.
Question 13. We are all grappling with the ability of foreign
nations to exploit technology platforms like Facebook to spread
propaganda and misinformation. While Facebook does not operate within
China, reports have shown that the Chinese government advertises
extensively on Facebook to spread propaganda in the U.S. and throughout
Southeast Asia. Reports indicate that the Chinese government is the
largest advertiser Facebook has in Asia. Do you believe Facebook should
be a platform for allowing foreign nations to spread propaganda? Are
the Chinese government's propaganda efforts consistent with Facebook's
goal of cracking down on misinformation?
Answer. Entities can maintain a presence on Facebook as long as
they comply with Facebook's policies, including complying with
applicable law. We hold all accounts to the same standards, including
standards related to authenticity, and we remove accounts and content
that violate our policies. For content that does not violate our
policies but that is false or misleading, we have begun to work with
third-party fact-checking organizations to provide additional
information to people who see or share this kind of content. Posts that
don't violate Facebook's policies but that are determined to be false
or disputed may also appear lower in News Feed and become less likely
to be widely distributed. If we become aware that our policies are
being violated, we will take action.
We've made important changes to prevent bad actors from using
misinformation to undermine the democratic process. Here is a list of
the 10 most important changes we have made:
Ads transparency. Advertising should be transparent: users
should be able to see all the ads an advertiser is currently
running on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. And for ads with
political content, we've created an archive that will hold ads
with political content for seven years--including information
about ad impressions and spend, as well as demographic data
such as age, gender, and location. People in Canada and Ireland
have already been able to see all the ads that a Page is
running on Facebook--and we've launched this globally.
Verification and labeling. Every advertiser will now need
confirm their ID and location before being able to run any ads
with political content in the U.S. All ads with political
content will also clearly state who paid for them.
Updating targeting. We want ads on Facebook to be safe and
civil. We thoroughly review the targeting criteria advertisers
can use to ensure they are consistent with our principles. As a
result, we removed nearly one-third of the targeting segments
used by the IRA. We continue to allow some criteria that people
may find controversial. But we do see businesses marketing
things like historical books, documentaries or television shows
using them in legitimate ways.
Better technology. Over the past year, we've gotten
increasingly better at finding and disabling fake accounts. We
now block millions of fake accounts each day as people try to
create them--and before they've done any harm. This is thanks
to improvements in machine learning and artificial
intelligence, which can proactively identify suspicious
behavior at a scale that was not possible before--without
needing to look at the content itself.
Action to tackle fake news. We block millions of fake
account attempts each day as people try to create them thanks
to improvements in machine learning and artificial
intelligence. We are also working hard to stop the spread of
false news. To reduce the spread of false news, we remove fake
accounts and disrupt economic incentives for traffickers of
misinformation. We also use various signals, including feedback
from our community, to identify potential false news. In
countries where we have partnerships with independent third-
party fact-checkers, stories rated as false by those fact-
checkers are shown lower in News Feed. If Pages or domains
repeatedly create or share misinformation, we significantly
reduce their distribution and remove their advertising rights.
Significant investments in security. We're doubling the
number of people working on safety and security from 10,000
last year to over 20,000 this year. We expect these investments
to impact our profitability. But the safety of people using
Facebook needs to come before profit.
Industry collaboration. Recently, we joined 34 global tech
and security companies in signing a TechAccord pact to help
improve security for everyone.
Information sharing and reporting channels. In the 2017
German elections, we worked closely with the authorities there,
including the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).
This gave them a dedicated reporting channel for security
issues related to the Federal elections.
Tracking 40+ elections. In recent months, we've started to
deploy new tools and teams to proactively identify threats in
the run-up to specific elections. We first tested this effort
during the Alabama Senate election, and plan to continue these
efforts for elections around the globe, including the U.S.
midterms. Last year we used public service announcements to
help inform people about fake news in 21 separate countries,
including in advance of French, Kenyan and German elections.
Action against the Russia-based IRA. In April, we removed 70
Facebook and 65 Instagram accounts--as well as 138 Facebook
Pages--controlled by the IRA primarily targeted either at
people living in Russia or Russian-speakers around the world
including from neighboring countries like Azerbaijan,
Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. The IRA has repeatedly used complex
networks of inauthentic accounts to deceive and manipulate
people in the U.S., Europe and Russia--and we don't want them
on Facebook anywhere in the world.
We are taking steps to enhance trust in the authenticity of
activity on our platform, including increasing ads transparency,
implementing a more robust ads review process, imposing tighter content
restrictions, and exploring how to add additional authenticity
safeguards.
Question 14. You have stated that users are able to download all of
the data that Facebook has about them. Does this include data that
Facebook has obtained through means such as cross-web tracking,
purchasing data from brokers, and inferential data created with that
user data?
If not, how can a user access this data?
Answer. Every user has a dedicated section in their settings which
enables them to access or download their information at any time. Our
Download Your Information or ``DYI'' tool is Facebook's data
portability tool and was launched many years ago to let people access
and download many types of information that we maintain about them. The
data in DYI and in our Ads Preferences tool contain each of the
interest categories that are used to show people ads, along with
information about the advertisers that are currently running ads based
on their use of an advertiser's website or app. People also can choose
not to see ads from those advertisers. We recently expanded the tools
we provide people for accessing their information, which will now allow
people to see their data, delete it, and easily download and export it.
More information is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/
new-privacy-protections/.
Responding to feedback that we should do more to provide
information about websites and apps that send us information when
people use them, we also announced plans to build Clear History. This
new feature will enable users to see the websites and apps that send us
information when they use them, clear this information from their
account, and turn off Facebook's ability to store it associated with
their account going forward.
We have also introduced Access Your Information. This feature
provides a new way for people to access and manage their information.
Users can go here to delete anything from their timeline or profile
that they no longer want on Facebook. They can also see their ad
interests, as well as information about ads they've clicked on and
advertisers who have provided us with information about them that
influence the ads they see. From here, they can go to their ad settings
to manage how this data is used to show them ads.
Question 15. Before the hearing, Facebook announced an independent
election research commission to solicit research on the effects of
social media on elections and democracy. Does Facebook plan to solicit
similar research on the effects of social media on other important
aspects of society, including privacy, mental health and wellbeing,
inequality, etc.?
Answer. Facebook employs social psychologists, social scientists,
and sociologists, and collaborates with top scholars to better
understand well-being. Facebook has also pledged $1 million towards
research to better understand the relationship between media
technologies, youth development and well-being. Facebook is teaming up
with experts in the field to look at the impact of mobile technology
and social media on kids and teens, as well as how to better support
them as they transition through different stages of life. Facebook is
committed to bringing people together and supporting well-being through
meaningful interactions on Facebook.
Question 16. Many large institutions have set up independent
systems to ensure transparency and internally check bad decisions.
Federal agencies have inspectors general and offices to encourage
whistleblowing. Many companies have ombudsmen, and some media companies
have public editors to help publicly examine and evaluate their
choices. Hospitals have ethics boards. What kinds of independent
systems does Facebook have? Have you considered setting up an
independent entity to help publicly examine and explain your decision-
making?
Answer. Facebook's Board of Directors acts as the management team's
adviser and monitors management's performance. The Board also reviews
and, if appropriate, approves significant transactions and develops
standards to be utilized by management in determining the types of
transactions that should be submitted to the Board for review and
approval or notification. The Board of Directors also has an Audit and
Risk Oversight Committee with an oversight role.
In addition to the Board's role, Facebook works with outside groups
on these issues. For example, Relman, Dane & Colfax, a respected civil
rights law firm, will carry out a comprehensive civil rights assessment
of Facebook's services and internal operations. Laura Murphy, a
national civil liberties and civil rights leader, will help guide this
process--getting feedback directly from civil rights groups, like The
Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and help advise
Facebook on the best path forward.
Moreover, Facebook recently announced a new initiative to help
provide independent, credible research about the role of social media
in elections, as well as democracy more generally. It will be funded by
the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, Democracy Fund, the William and
Flora Hewlett Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation,
the Charles Koch Foundation, the Omidyar Network, and the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation. At the heart of this initiative will be a group of
scholars who will:
Define the research agenda;
Solicit proposals for independent research on a range of
different topics; and
Manage a peer review process to select scholars who will
receive funding for their research, as well as access to
privacy-protected datasets from Facebook which they can
analyze.
Facebook will not have any right to review or approve the r
research findings prior to publication. More information regarding the
study is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/new-
elections-initiative/.
Question 17. When Facebook comes across terrorist-related content--
such as ISIS or al-Qaeda propaganda--does Facebook proactively alert
Federal law enforcement to the terrorist content? If not, under what
circumstances will Facebook alert Federal law enforcement about
terrorist propaganda on your platform?
Answer. We reach out to law enforcement if we learn of content that
we believe reflects a credible threat of imminent harm. We have been
able to provide support to authorities around the world that are
responding to the threat of terrorism, including in cases where law
enforcement has been able to disrupt attacks and prevent harm. Further,
as part of official investigations, government officials sometimes
request data about people who use Facebook. We have strict processes in
place to handle these government requests, and we disclose account
records in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. We
publish more information in our Law Enforcement Guidelines at https://
www.facebook.com/safety/groups/law/guidelines/ and Transparency Report
at https://transparency.facebook.com/.
Question 18. The other question I had, and it does not just apply
to Facebook, is should the framework include financial penalties when
large providers like Facebook are breached and privacy is compromised
as a result? There is very little incentive for whether it is Facebook
or Equifax to actually be abreast of protecting customer privacy and
working for potential breaches or vulnerabilities in the system.
Answer. Protecting people's data is one of our most important
responsibilities. We know that if people don't trust that their
information will be safe on Facebook, they won't feel comfortable using
our services.
We have every incentive to work as hard as we can to protect
people's information, and we're committed to continuing our work to
improve those protections.
Facebook is generally open to the idea of Federal breach
notification requirements, particularly legislation that would
centralize reporting and ensure a consistent approach across the United
States. For example, in Europe, the GDPR requires notification to a
lead supervisory authority, rather than individual member states, in
cases of a data breach. In the United States, however, there is no
centralized notification scheme, and instead, reporting obligations
vary widely across all 50 states. This complexity makes it harder to
respond appropriately and swiftly to protect people in the event of a
data breach. We believe this is an important issue and an area that is
ripe for thoughtful regulation.
Facebook is generally not opposed to regulation but wants to ensure
it is the right regulation. We are already regulated in many ways--for
example, under the Federal Trade Commission Act--and we are subject to
ongoing oversight by the FTC under the terms of a 2011 consent order.
Facebook has inherent incentives to protect its customers' privacy and
address breaches and vulnerabilities. Indeed, the recent discovery of
misconduct by an app developer on the Facebook platform clearly hurt
Facebook and made it harder for us to achieve our social mission. As
such, Facebook is committed to protecting our platform from bad actors,
ensuring we are able to continue our mission of giving people a voice
and bringing them closer together.
We are also actively building new technologies to help prevent
abuse on its platform, including advanced AI tools to monitor and
remove fake accounts. We have also significantly increased our
investment in security, employing more than 15,000 individuals working
solely on security and content review and planning to increase that
number to over 20,000 by the end of the year. We have also strengthened
our advertising policies, seeking to prevent discrimination while
improving transparency.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
to Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. Children's Data: Does Instagram have an age limit
requirement similar to the 13 years old Facebook requires?
Answer. Yes, Instagram requires everyone to be at least 13 years
old before they can create an account (and in some jurisdictions, this
age limit may be higher).
Question 2. How vulnerable or widely utilized have children's (18
or younger) data been in both Facebook and your other platforms?
Answer. We take the privacy, safety, and security of all those who
use our platform very seriously, and when it comes to minors (13 to 18
years old), we provide special protections and resources.
We also provide special protections for teens on Facebook and
Messenger. We provide education before allowing teens to post publicly.
We don't show search results based on specific profile data (high
school, birthday/age, and hometown, or current city) of teens to
unconnected adults when the adults search on Facebook. Unconnected
adults can't message minors who are 13-17. And, we prohibit search
engines off Facebook from indexing minors' profiles. And, we have age
limits for advertisements. For example, ads for dating sites, financial
services, and other products or services are gated to users under 18.
We provide special resources to help ensure that they enjoy a safe
and secure experience. For example, we recently announced the launch of
our Youth Portal, which is available in 60 languages at https://
www.facebook.com/safety/youth. This portal is a central place for teens
that includes:
Education. Information on how to get the most out of
products like Pages, Groups, Events, and Profile, while staying
safe. Plus, information on the types of data Facebook collects
and how we use it.
Peer Voices. First-person accounts from teens around the
world about how they are using technology in new and creative
ways.
Ways to control user experience. Tips on things like
security, reporting content, and deciding who can see what
teens share.
Advice. Guidelines for how to safely get the most out of the
internet.
Instagram also will be providing information to teens to show them
where they can learn about all of the tools on Instagram to manage
their privacy and stay safe online, including how to use the new Access
and Download tools to understand what they have shared online and learn
how to delete things they no longer want to share. We are also making
this information available in formats specifically designed for young
users, including video tutorials for our privacy and safety tools, and
teen-friendly FAQs about the Instagram Terms of Use, Data Policy,
safety features, and Community Guidelines.
Instagram has also launched new content on Instagram Together,
including videos and FAQs about privacy controls; information on how to
use safety features, including comment controls, blocking accounts,
reporting abuse, spam, or troubling messages; information on
responsible social media use; and FAQs about safety on Instagram. We
will be reaching out to users under 18 on Instagram to encourage them
to learn more on Instagram Together, available at https://
www.instagram-together.com/.
Further, we have content restrictions and reporting features for
everyone, including minors. We have Community Standards that prohibit
hate speech, bullying, intimidation, and other kinds of harmful
behavior. We encourage people to report posts and rely on our team of
content reviewers around the world to review reported content. Our
reviewers are trained to look for violations and enforce our policies
consistently and as objectively as possible. When reviewed by our team,
we hide certain graphic content from users under 18 (and include a
warning for adults). We are also working to improve our ability to get
our community help in real time, especially in instances where someone
is expressing thoughts of suicide or self-harm, by expanding our use of
proactive detection, working with safety experts and first-responders,
and dedicating more reviewers from our Community Operations team.
Question 3. How many children (18 or younger) had their data taken
during the Cambridge Analytica breach?
Answer. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
requires parental consent and notification in specific instances
involving the collection and use of data about children under the age
of 13. Facebook does not allow children under the age of 13 on its
service or collect data about children under 13 that would trigger
parental consent or notification.
Question 4. Are you notifying parents about their children's
exposed data?
Answer. See Response to Question 3.
Question 5. Discriminatory Advertising: Please provide a detailed
description, including screenshots if applicable, of the
nondiscrimination compliance certification that Facebook currently
requires advertisers to complete.
Answer. Please refer to our letter to you dated May 16, 2018.
Question 6. Please provide a complete list of the characteristics,
categories, descriptors, and/or interests that Facebook allows
advertisers to select in order to target certain users for inclusion in
an advertisement's audience.
Answer. Please refer to our letter to you dated May 16, 2018.
Please note, however, that in limited cases and for the purpose of
running ads that are not related to housing, employment or credit, we
are re-enabling the ability of advertisers to exclude people from their
audiences based on family status but are reviewing this as a targeting
option.
Question 7. Please provide a complete list of the characteristics,
categories, descriptors, and/or interests that Facebook allows
advertisers to select in order to exclude certain users from an
advertisement's audience.
Answer. See Response to Question 6.
Question 8. Are there any characteristics, categories, descriptors,
and/or interests that
Facebook had previously permitted advertisers to select, but that
Facebook no longer allows to be selected as targeting or exclusion
criteria? If so, please provide a complete list of those
characteristics, categories, descriptors, and/or interests.
Answer. See Response to Question 6.
Question 9. Are there certain characteristics, categories,
descriptors, and/or interests that Facebook has never allowed
advertisers to select for the purpose of targeting or excluding users
from an advertisement's audience? If so, please provide a complete list
of those characteristics, categories, descriptors, and/or interests.
Answer. See Response to Question 6.
Question 10. Please describe the process that Facebook uses to
determine whether a characteristic, category, descriptor, or interest
will be available for selection as a targeting or exclusion criteria.
If Facebook has a written policy governing this determination, please
provide a copy.
Answer. We have Community Standards that prohibit hate speech,
bullying, intimidation, and other kinds of harmful behavior. We hold
advertisers to even stricter advertising policies to protect users from
things like discriminatory ads. We don't want advertising to be used
for hate or discrimination, and our policies reflect that. For example,
our Advertising Policies make it clear that advertisers may not
discriminate against people based on personal attributes such as race,
ethnicity, color, national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, family status, disability, and medical or
genetic condition. The Policies also prohibit asserting or implying
that a person belongs to one of these groups.
We educate advertisers on our anti-discrimination policy, and when
we detect that an advertiser is attempting to run a housing, employment
or credit ad, we require the advertiser to certify compliance with our
anti-discrimination policy and anti-discrimination laws. We are
committed to getting better at enforcing our advertising policies. We
review many ads proactively using automated and manual tools, and
reactively when people hide, block, or mark ads as offensive. We are
taking aggressive steps to strengthen both our automated and our manual
review. We are also expanding our global ads review teams and investing
more in machine learning to better understand when to flag and take
down ads, such as ads that use our multicultural affinity segments in
connection with offers of housing, employment or credit opportunities.
Question 11. Regardless of whether the characteristics are
described as demographic, behavioral, or interest-based criteria, does
Facebook allow employment, housing, credit advertisements to be
targeted to users on the basis of protected characteristics, including
race, national origin, religion, sex, gender, disability, age, and
familial status?
Answer. See Response to Question 6.
Question 12. Regardless of whether the characteristics are
described as demographic, behavioral, or interest-based criteria, does
Facebook allow advertisers for employment and housing to exclude users
on the basis of protected characteristics, including race, national
origin, religion, sex, gender, disability, age, and familial status?
Answer. See Response to Question 6.
Question 13. Has Facebook reviewed characteristics/categories
available for advertising to select or exclude when targeting that can
be used as ``proxies'' for protected characteristics? If so, what is
Facebook's policy regarding the continued availability of that
characteristic as a targeting or exclusion criteria and has Facebook
ever removed categories that were being used as ``proxies'' for
protected categories? How does Facebook go about determining which such
categories could potentially be used as ``proxies'' for discrimination?
Answer. See Response to Question 10.
Question 14. Does Facebook allow employment, housing, and credit
advertisements to be targeted to users on the basis of categories that
may be reasonable proxies for protected characteristics?
Answer. See Response to Question 6.
Question 15. Does Facebook allow employment, housing, and credit
advertisements to be targeted to users on the basis of their sexual
orientation or gender identity?
Answer. Please refer to our letter to you dated May 16, 2018.
Question 16. In Facebook's December 20, 2017 press release, Rob
Goldman, VP of Ads, wrote that Facebook ``proactively look[s] for bad
ads, and investigate[s] concerns when they are raised.'' Please
describe Facebook's process for monitoring ads for possible violations
of Title VII, the Fair Housing Act, the Americans with Disabilities
Act, and Title II of the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act.
Answer. Please refer to our letter to you dated May 16, 2018.
Question 17. Does Facebook ``proactively look'' for ads that may be
discriminatory on the basis of each protected characteristic before
they are posted to the platform?
Answer. Please refer to our letter to you dated May 16, 2018.
Question 18. Does Facebook have defined, written policies for
determining whether an employment, housing, or credit ad is
discriminatory on the basis of each protected characteristic, and a
procedure for deleting such ads? If so, please provide copies of such
policies.
Answer. Please refer to our letter to you dated May 16, 2018.
Question 19. Has Facebook ever proactively deleted an employment,
housing, or credit ad on the grounds that it discriminated on the basis
of a protected characteristic? If so, how many such ads has Facebook
deleted, broken down by each protected characteristic?
Answer. Please refer to our letter to you dated May 16, 2018.
Question 20. Has Facebook ever deleted an employment, housing, or
credit ad on the grounds that it discriminated on the basis of a
protected characteristic in response to a user complaint? If so, how
many such ads has Facebook deleted, broken down by each protected
characteristic?
Answer. Please refer to our letter to you dated May 16, 2018.
Question 21. Has Facebook ever barred a businesses or ad companies
from using its services because of discriminatory ads? How many? Please
detail the process Facebook has for addressing discriminatory
advertisers, once identified.
Answer. Please refer to our letter to you dated May 16, 2018.
Question 22. Many state and local nondiscrimination laws go further

classes. Does Facebook require advertisers to certify that they will
comply with state and local nondiscrimination laws?
Answer. Please refer to our letter to you dated May 16, 2018.
Question 23. Does Facebook ``proactively look'' at employment,
housing, and credit ads to evaluate their compliance with state and
local nondiscrimination laws?

Question 25. Please provide a timeline and any relevant
documentation of interactions with the U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development on Facebook's advertisement policies.
Answer. Please refer to our letter to you dated May 16, 2018.
Question 26. Please provide a detailed description of any other
U.S. Federal agencies that have contacted Facebook regarding the issue
of discriminatory advertising on the Facebook platform.
Answer. We regularly work cooperatively with regulators that may
have questions about our platform and are happy to answer questions.
Question 27. Please describe when this contact took place and a
detailed description of the agency's inquiry and interaction with
Facebook, as well as Facebook's response.
Answer. See Response to Question 26.
Question 28. Will Facebook commit to having an outside entity
conducting a Civil Rights Audit of its platform and advertising
practices? If so, will Facebook commit to meaningfully consulting civil
rights organizations on the perimeters of the Civil Rights Audit? Will
Facebook commit to making the results of such audit accessible to the
public?
Answer. Relman, Dane & Colfax, a respected civil rights law firm,
will carry out a comprehensive civil rights assessment of Facebook's
services and internal operations. Laura Murphy, a national civil
liberties and civil rights leader, will help guide this process--
getting feedback directly from civil rights groups, like The Leadership
Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and help advise Facebook on the
best path forward.
Question 29. Discrimination and Diversity in Tech Community: Over
the past few months, our country has been reckoning with some hard
truths about the way that women and minorities are treated in the
workplace. And I think this is a moment for all types of organizations,
including tech giants like the one represented here, to take a clear-
eyed accounting of their culture and practices, to take responsibility
for what hasn't worked, and to renew their commitments to make
meaningful improvements. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's
2016 report on ``Diversity in High Tech'' found that that women,
African Americans, and Hispanics are all represented at significantly
lower levels in high tech than in private industry as a whole. And
while recent internal studies by you at Facebook, and Google, have
showed some progress in the hiring of women, there has not been equal
improvement in the representation of people of color and other
underrepresented groups.
What does diversity mean to you, and how do you want it reflected
in your operations?
Answer. With a global community of over two billion people on
Facebook, greater diversity and inclusivity are critical to achieving
our mission. Studies have shown that cognitive diversity on teams that
are working on hard problems produces better results. Diversity helps
us build better products, make better decisions and better serve our
community. In order to achieve that, we have developed programming to
attract and retain more people from traditionally underrepresented
groups which include women, people of color, veterans and people with
disabilities.
We are not where we would like to be, but we are encouraged that
representation for people from underrepresented groups at Facebook has
increased. We've grown Black and Hispanic representation by 1 percent
each (2 percent combined) between our first report in 2014 and our most
recent report in 2017:
Black Representation: from 2 percent to 3 percent
Hispanic Representation: from 4 percent to 5 percent
Black Non-Tech: from 2 percent to 6 percent
Hispanic Non-Tech: from 6 percent to 8 percent
Black Leadership: from 2 percent to 3 percent
Hispanic Leadership: from 3 percent to 4 percent
Black and Hispanic Tech have stayed at 1 percent and 3
percent
As of August 2017, the number of women globally increased from 33
percent to 35 percent:
Women in Tech: from 17 percent to 19 percent
Women in Non-Tech: from 47 percent to 55 percent
Women in Leadership: from 23 percent to 28 percent
Women made up 27 percent of all new graduate hires in
engineering and 21 percent of all new technical hires at
Facebook.
We seek to promote diversity in a variety of ways, and we want to
highlight three programs in particular. First, we have adopted our
Diverse Slate Approach (DSA) to interviewing job candidates. The more
people that hirers interview who don't look or think like them, the
more likely they are to hire someone from a diverse background. To
hardwire this behavior at Facebook, we introduced our DSA in 2015 and
have since rolled it out globally. DSA sets the expectation that hiring
managers will consider candidates from underrepresented backgrounds
when interviewing for an open position.
Second, we are working to reduce unconscious bias. Our publicly
available Managing Unconscious Bias class encourages our people to
challenge and correct bias as soon as they see it--in others, and in
themselves. We've also doubled down by adding two additional internal
programs: Managing Inclusion, which trains managers to understand the
issues that affect marginalized communities, and Be The Ally, which
gives everyone the common language, tools, and space to practice
supporting others.
Third, we have created Facebook University. We want to increase
access and opportunity for students with an interest in software
engineering, business, and analytics. Facebook University (FBU) gives
underrepresented students extra training and mentorship earlier in
their college education. We started FBU in 2013 with 30 students and
expect to have 280 in 2018. More than 500 students have graduated from
this program, with many returning to Facebook for internships and full-
time jobs.
Finally, we have many partnerships to move the numbers nationally
such as Black Girls Code, All Star Code, Hack the Hood, The Hidden
Genius Project, Level Playing Field Institute, Yes We Code, Streetcode
Academy, Dev Color, Dev Bootcamp and Techbridge. And, we now recruit at
300 Universities--including historically black colleges and
universities (HBCUs) like Spelman, Morehouse, Howard, NCA&T, and Morgan
State (EIR) and the HBCU Faculty Summit.
We're committed to building a more diverse, inclusive Facebook.
Much like our approach to launching new products on our platform, we
are willing to experiment and listen to feedback.
Question 30. How are your entities working to address issues of
discrimination, or lack of diversity, in your own workforce?
Answer. See Response to Question 29.
Question 31. Do you believe those efforts are sufficient and what
do you believe is needed throughout the tech sector to address the
mistreatment of some, and the need to expand ladders of opportunities
for everyone?
Answer. See Response to Question 29.
Question 32. Like most companies, Facebook files numerous patents
on its emerging technology and I'd like to raise concerns about some of
the patents that your company has recently filed.
One is titled ``Socioeconomic group classification based on user
features'' which is technology that would allow Facebook to group users
into upper, middle, and working classes based on user action. It was
recently discovered that Facebook has allowed advertisers to
discriminate on the base of age.
How can we be confident that your company will crack down on
discriminatory behavior as it is developing technology to group users
into class?
Answer. Discriminatory advertising has no place on Facebook's
platform and Facebook removes such content as soon as it becomes aware
of it. Facebook's policies prohibit advertisers from discriminating
against people on personal attributes such as race, ethnicity, color,
national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity, family status, disability, and medical or genetic conditions.
Facebook educates advertisers on our anti-discrimination policy, and in
some cases, requires the advertisers to certify compliance with
Facebook's anti-discrimination policy and anti-discrimination laws.
Facebook also uses machine learning to help identify ads that offer
housing, employment, or credit opportunities. When an advertiser
attempts to show an ad that Facebook identifies as offering a housing,
employment, or credit opportunity and includes Facebook's multicultural
advertising segments, Facebook will disapprove the ad. Facebook also
requires advertisers to certify that they are complying with Facebook's
updated anti-discrimination policy and anti-discrimination laws when
the advertiser attempts to show a housing, employment, or credit
opportunity and uses any other audience segment on Facebook.
Question 33. What other uses could this patent possibly have?
Answer. See Response to Question 1.
Question 34. Equal Pay Day: Mr. Zuckerberg, the date you appeared
before was Equal Pay Day in America, which symbolizes the number of
extra days a typical woman who works full-time, year-round must work
into this year to be paid what a typical white man got paid. Women are
still only paid 80 cents on the dollar compared to men. It's estimated
that women employed full time in the U.S. will lose nearly $900 billion
to the wage gap this year. I'm passionate about getting
underrepresented folks into the job opportunities that our tech
revolution provides, and equal pay goes along with creating those
ladders of opportunities.
Is this an issue you are aware of and active on within your
operations?
Answer. At Facebook, women and men receive equal pay for equal work
and have done so for many years. This is an absolute minimum standard
for a diverse business such as ours and we continually review our
hiring and compensation practices to ensure this remains the case.
Compensation at Facebook is made up of base salary, cash bonus or
commission, and equity in the company. We work hard to avoid
unconscious bias affecting how much people get paid. Managers don't
make decisions about compensation increases--instead, we use a
formulaic approach that determines pay based on performance and level.
Opportunities for advancement and leadership within the company are
also crucial. For our women employees, we run a series of development
workshops and training programs designed to provide a strong network of
support, along with the tools they need to be the best leaders they can
be across different levels in the company. We hold ourselves
accountable because this matters to us. In 2017, the number of women
employees globally rose from 33 percent to 35 percent and the number of
women in technical roles increased from 17 percent to 19 percent.
Between 2014 when we first publicly reported our representation data
and 2017, the number of women in leadership roles has increased from 23
percent to 28 percent.
We are committed to increasing the representation of women at all
levels. We know we're not where we need to be, and we're committed to
making real progress.
With a global community of over two billion people on Facebook,
greater diversity and inclusivity are critical to achieving our
mission. Studies have shown that cognitive diversity on teams that are
working on hard problems produces better results. Diversity helps us
build better products, make better decisions, and better serve our
community.
Question 35. Can you provide us confirmation, including figures,
that your pay for women matches their male counterparts?
Answer. See Response to Question 32.
Question 36. And that you appropriately compensate all of your
employees based on their job title and value to the company?
Answer. See Response to Question 32.
Question 37. Facebook's self-regulation of Campaign and Issue Ads &
the Honest Ads Act: You recently announced that political ads run on
Facebook are now going to be subject to heightened transparency
requirements, such as including disclaimers stating who paid for the
ad, and making it easier for viewers to see the ads that a page is
running. I think this is a good first step but there are several
questions I have regarding its implementation and how you will enforce
this new policy.
What if you have an organization, let's call them ``XYZ,'' who
wants to post an issue or political ad, but they have never filed
reports with the FEC, they are not registered with the IRS as a
nonprofit, and they don't appear to have a website?
Answer. We now require more thorough documentation from advertisers
who want to run ads with political content. Any person who wants to run
one of these ads must upload an identification document and provide the
last four digits of their Social Security number. They also must prove
residency in the U.S. by providing a residential mailing address. Once
they provide the address, we mail a letter with a code that the person
must provide to us in order to become authorized to run ads with
political content.
Question 38. You have said that advertisers running political ads
and issue ads will have to be ``authorized,'' and that Facebook will
confirm their identity and location before running ads. What does it
mean to ``confirm their identity?''
Answer. See Response to Question 37.
Question 39. Walk me through how this ad would be treated under
Facebook's new policies.
Answer. See Response to Question 37.
Question 40. So, this ad will say ``paid for by XYZ.'' But there is
no public record of XYZ, besides the fact that they have a Facebook
page. Would you let a mysterious group like this run an ad on Facebook
without any further information about who they are?
Answer. See Response to Question 37.
Question 41. Will you require any further verification from this
group?
Answer. See Response to Question 37.
Question 42. Will these transparency measures you are discussing
tell you who paid the Facebook page to run the ad? In other words, will
Facebook disclose the sources of funding for these political ads?
Answer. Once verified as described above in response to Question 1,
these advertisers will have to include a disclosure in these ads, which
reads: ``Paid for by.'' When users click on the disclosure, they will
be able to see details about the advertiser. These ads will also all
appear in a searchable archive, available at www.facebook.com/
politicalcontentads, which includes information about how much the
advertiser spent on the ad, how many people saw it, and general
demographic information about the people who saw it.
Question 43. What if a foreign government gave money to a Facebook
page with a U.S. address to run political ads? Would you tell that to
viewers?
Answer. These are real challenges and reflect problems largely
outside our control, but we will continue to work to improve our
enforcement of ads that violate our policies.
Question 44. What if a foreign government gave money to a Facebook
page through a series of shell companies or LLCs?
Answer. See Response to Question 43.
Question 45. How will Facebook know who the real donors to this
group are?
Answer. See Response to Question 43.
Question 46. How is Facebook defining a ``political ad'' and an
``issue ad'' subject to these heightened transparency measures?
Answer. Our Political Advertising Policy (https://www.facebook.com/
policies/ads/restricted_content/political) applies to any ad that:
Is made by, on behalf of or about a current or former
candidate for public office, a political party, a political
action committee or advocates for the outcome of an election to
public office;
Relates to any election, referendum or ballot initiative,
including ``get out the vote'' or election information
campaigns;
Relates to any national legislative issue of public
importance in any place where the ad is being run; or
Is regulated as political advertising.
We further define ``national legislative issue of public
importance'' as including twenty issues. Ads that take a position on
one or more of these issues are covered by the policy. To develop this
initial list (which we expect to evolve over time), we worked with the
non-partisan Project and many other stakeholders from across the
political spectrum.
We determine whether an ad is subject to our Political Advertising
policy based on the content of the ad.
Question 47. Is the ``political ad/issue ad'' determination based
on the content of a particular ad, or the identity of the advertiser
running the ad, or some other criteria?
Answer. See Response to Question 46.
Question 48. Facebook sells several types of ads, including
sponsored ads that appear directly in a user's newsfeed, and smaller
ads that appear on the right column. Studies show that a large volume
of political ads from the 2016 election ran in the right column rather
than in a user's newsfeed.
Will all types of ads sold by Facebook, including smaller ads, be
subject to these heightened transparency measures?
Answer. Yes, all ads with political content will be subject to this
policy.
Question 49. You mentioned that the disclaimers Facebook is going
to implement will say which Facebook page paid for the ad. Will it tell
you exactly what organization or individual is behind that page?
Answer. We require the advertiser to disclose who paid for an ad
with political content--regardless of whether that is an individual or
an organization.
Question 50. Rob Goldman, the Vice President of Ads at your
company, indicated that you are working with the ``third parties'' to
develop these parameters. Who are these ``third parties?''
Answer. See Response to Question 47.
Question 51. Will these ad transparency measures also apply to
state and local elections?
Answer. Our Political Advertising policy applies to all advertisers
running ads with political content. The products we have launched
(authorization, disclaimer, and archive) are available to all
advertisers running ads with political content to users in the U.S.
Question 52. Will these same measures apply to other platforms
owned by Facebook, like Instagram?
Answer. Yes, the measures will apply to ads with political content
shown on Instagram.
Question 53. New Employees--Content Review: In your testimony, you
note that Facebook plans to hire an additional 5,000 workers for its
security and content review teams, for a total of 20,000 workers by the
end of this year. But Facebook first announced the plan for a 20,000
person security team in late October of last year, in response to
concerns about Russian interference in the election.
Given the additional revelations about the role of Cambridge
Analytica and other third party apps in compromising the privacy and
personal information of at least 87 million users, do you still believe
20,000 is the appropriate level of staffing for Facebook's security
team?
Answer. Our effort to make our platform safer and more secure is a
holistic one that involves a continual evaluation of our personnel,
processes, and policies, and we make changes as appropriate.
We are doubling the size of our security and content review teams
(from 10,000 to 20,000) over the course of this year. We currently have
approximately 15,000 people working on these teams.
Of that 15,000, more than 7,500 people review content around the
world.
Our content review team is global and reviews reports in
over 50 languages.
Reports are reviewed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and the
vast majority of reports are reviewed within 24 hours.
Our goal is always to have the right number of skilled
people with the right language capabilities to ensure incoming
reports are reviewed quickly and efficiently.
We hire people with native language and other specialist
skills according to the needs we see from incoming reports.
The team also includes specialists in areas like child
safety, hate speech and counter-terrorism, software engineers
to develop review systems, quality control managers, policy
specialists, legal specialists, and general reviewers.
We are also using machine learning to better detect and action on
content and people that should not be using our platform.
For example, we incorporated learnings from interference in
previous elections to better detect and stop false accounts from
spreading misinformation in more recent elections.
We recently shared how we are using machine learning to prevent bad
actors like terrorists or scammers from using our platform (https://
www.facebook.com/notes/facebook-security/introducing-new-machine-
learning-techniques-to-help-stop-scams/10155213964780766/).
We employ a mix of full-time employees, contractors and vendor
partners to assist with content review and help us scale globally.
We partner with reputable vendors who are required to comply with
specific obligations, ns for resiliency, support, transparency, and
user privacy.
Question 54. Will these new security and content review workers be
direct employees of Facebook, or do you plan to outsource this work to
third party entities?
Answer. See Response to Question 53.
Question 55. If the security review work is outsourced, how will
Facebook vet those contractors, subcontractors, and employees and where
will those employees be located?
Answer. See Response to Question 53.
Question 56. And how can Facebook assure its users that there will
be transparency and accountability for any future breaches of privacy
if the company is outsourcing its security work?
Answer. See Response to Question 53.
Question 57. Future Facebook Technology: One of your recent patent
is titled ``Dynamic eye tracking calibration'' and another is called
``Techniques for emotion detection and content delivery''. The patent
for the eye tracking technology says that ``the (eye) calibration
process is performed automatically in the background while the user
uses a device.'' The second patent would use a device's camera to
monitor your emotions and ``display content based upon a received
emotion type.''
How does Facebook plan to use this technology?
Answer. Like many companies, we apply for a wide variety of patents
to protect our intellectual property. Right now we're not building
technology to identify people with eye-tracking cameras. However, we're
always exploring how new technologies and methods can improve our
services, and eye-based identification is one way that we could
potentially reduce consumer friction and add security for people when
they log into Oculus or access Oculus content.
If we implement this technology in the future, we will absolutely
do so with people's privacy in mind, just as we do with movement
information (which we anonymize in our systems).
As we continue to develop new virtual reality products and
services, we're committed to being transparent and open about the
information that we collect and how we use it, as well as any ways that
changes over time.
Question 58. Will users be fully aware that their eyes and emotions
are being tracked?
Answer. See Response to Question 57.
Question 59. Is Facebook confident it has the proper data security
in place to have this intimate level of data on users?
Answer. See Response to Question 57.
Question 60. Facebook has reportedly been developing an in-home
digital assistant similar to products like Alexa, will this also be
tracking this granular level of data?
Answer. See Response to Question 57.
Question 61. The second patent says that content will be delivered
on a person's perceived emotion type. Couldn't this be potentially
dangerous in amplifying hateful messages?
Answer. See Response to Question 57.
Question 62. If a person focuses on an image of say, a propaganda
image of immigrants, will this technology deliver more of this content?
Answer. See Response to Question 57.
Question 63. China's Facebook Access: In July 2009, the Chinese
government blocked Facebook in China. The precise reason for that
action remains obscure, but it fits into an overall pattern. The
Chinese government is unwilling to allow a social media platform--
foreign or domestic--to operate in China unless it agrees to abide by
Chinese law. First, a social media platform must agree to censor
content and conversations in line with directives from China's
information authorities. And second, businesses that collect data from
Chinese individuals can only store that data in China where,
presumably, it would be easier for the Chinese government to access,
via legal means or otherwise. You've made no secret of your desire to
see Facebook available once again in China.
Could you please reveal to the Committee whether you are willing to
agree to either of these requirements?
Answer. Because Facebook has been blocked in China since 2009, we
are not in a position to know exactly how the government would seek to
apply its laws and regulations on content were we permitted to offer
our service to Chinese users. Since 2013, Facebook has been a member of
the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a multi-stakeholder digital rights
initiative. As part of our membership, Facebook has committed to the
freedom of expression and privacy standards set out in the GNI
Principles--which are in turn based on the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights--and we are independently assessed on our compliance with
these standards on a biennial basis.
In keeping with these commitments, rigorous human rights due
diligence and careful consideration of free expression and privacy
implications would constitute important components of any decision on
entering China. Facebook has been blocked in China since 2009, and no
decisions have been made around the conditions under which any possible
future service might be offered in China.
Question 64. And will Facebook pledge to guarantee its future
Chinese users the same level of privacy protection it gives its users
in the U.S. and the European Union?
Answer. Everyone in the world deserves good privacy protection.
Question 65. Consent Agreement: The FTC consent agreement with
Facebook requires an independent, biennial audit of Facebook's privacy
controls--when exactly have those audits been conducted, and what were
the results?
Answer. To date, three independent privacy assessments prepared by
PwC have been completed and submitted to the FTC: a 180-Day Assessment
(dated April 16, 2013), a biennial privacy assessment covering the
period between February 12, 2013 and February 11, 2015 (dated April 13,
2015), and a biennial privacy assessment covering the period between
February 12, 2015 and February 11, 2017 (dated April 12, 2017). In each
of these assessments, PwC determined that Facebook's privacy controls
were operating with sufficient effectiveness to protect the privacy
information covered under the FTC Consent Order.
Question 66. Did Facebook inform any of its auditors of the
Cambridge Analytica data leak? Did any of Facebook's auditors know
about the Cambridge Analytic data leak?
Answer. Facebook routinely undertakes internal and external
reviews, including undergoing biennial assessments under Facebook's
consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission, which focus on the
functioning of privacy controls that are part of Facebook's privacy
program. As a part of the assessments, our independent assessors (PwC)
have onsite access to our personnel and records, and we provide them
with such access to information and personnel as they request in order
to perform their work. PwC is also permitted to conduct a number of
tests to determine whether the privacy controls in place under our
privacy program--including controls relating to developer's access to
information--are working properly. In its capacity as independent
assessor, PwC evaluates the sufficiency of our controls through
independent testing and requesting information that we provide to
conduct that evaluation. Their focus is on evaluating the operation and
sufficiency of our controls, rather than specific incidents.
Kogan's violation of Facebook's Platform Policies was widely
reported at the time Facebook learned about it, including reporting in
The Guardian on December 11, 2015, which reported that Kogan and his
company, GSR, may have passed information Kogan's app had obtained from
Facebook users to SCL Elections Ltd. No data was transferred to Kogan's
app unless it was authorized by the users who installed his app, so
there was not a data leak from Facebook's systems. However, based on
public reports and testimony, it appears that Kogan may have improperly
transferred data to Cambridge Analytica in violation of our policies.
Question 67. Does Facebook choose which policies and procedures the
auditors look at? Please explain in detail how these policies and
procedures are chosen? Does the 3rd party auditor have any say on what
policies and procedures are examined? Does the FTC have any input on
how an audit is structured?
Answer. Facebook's privacy assessments are conducted pursuant to
the July 27, 2012 Consent Order. They are conducted by an independent
third-party professional (PwC) pursuant to the procedures and standards
generally accepted in the profession and required by the FTC, as set
forth in the Consent Order. Facebook incorporated GAPP principles in
designing its privacy program and related controls, which are
considered industry leading principles for protecting the privacy and
security of personal information. Facebook provided the FTC with
summaries of these controls and engaged extensively with the FTC
regarding the structure of its privacy program. Facebook has submitted
copies of each assessment to the FTC.
Question 68. Will Facebook commit to making the entirety of PwC
audit submitted to the Federal Trade Commission in 2017 public? If not,
please describe in detail why.
Answer. The privacy assessments conducted by PwC contain both
Facebook's and PwC's sensitive business information that are
confidential in order to prevent competitive harm and to ensure the
integrity of Facebook's privacy program, including the steps that we
take to protect people's information. We have furnished these reports
to the FTC and are prepared to review the reports with regulators and
lawmakers with appropriate assurances that confidential information or
information that could be exploited to circumvent Facebook's privacy
protections will not be disclosed publicly.
Question 69. During the negotiations with the FTC in 2011, were you
asked by them to remove the capability to expose friends from having
their data utilized without their direct permission?
Answer. We furnished extensive information to the FTC regarding the
ability for users to port their Facebook data (including friends data
that had been shared with them) with apps on Facebook's platform, as
part of the FTC's investigation culminating in the July 27, 2012
Consent Order. The Consent Order memorializes the agreement between
Facebook and did not require Facebook to turn off the ability for
people to port friends data that had been shared with them on Facebook
to apps they used. Facebook voluntarily changed this feature of
Platform in 2014, however.
It is worth noting that in 2011, Facebook offered more control and
protection over the availability of friends data to apps than any other
digital platform at the time, including mobile app platforms, which
generally permitted apps to access user data and their friends' data
without consent or any control. By contrast, Facebook notified users of
each category of data an app could access--including friends data--
before the user consented to the app, and also provided all users with
controls that would prevent their friends from sharing their data with
apps on Facebook's platform.
Question 70. Hospital Data Sharing Project: It was reported by CNBC
on April 5 that your company was in talks with top hospitals and other
medical groups as recently as March 2018 about a proposal to share data
you possess with the patients. As of now, the project is reportedly
``on hiatus'' so that Facebook can do a better job of protecting
individuals' data.
Please provide us the specific privacy concerns Facebook has with
compiling your users' data with medical data possessed by the
hospitals?
Answer. The medical industry has long understood that there are
general health benefits to having a close-knit circle of family and
friends. But deeper research into this link is needed to help medical
professionals develop specific treatment and intervention plans that
take social connection into account. With this in mind, last year
Facebook began discussions with leading medical institutions, including
the American College of Cardiology and the Stanford University School
of Medicine, to explore whether scientific research using fully-
anonymized Facebook data could help the medical community advance our
understanding in this area. This work has not progressed past the
planning phase, and we have not received, shared, or analyzed anyone's
data.
In March, we decided that we should pause these discussions so we
can focus on other important work, including doing a better job of
protecting people's data and being clearer with them about how that
data is used in our products and services.
Question 71. Would you share any internal documents that led
Facebook to put this project on hiatus?
Answer. See Response to Question 70.
Question 72. Data Details & FB Messenger Data: Based on the FTC-
Facebook consent order, your company collects a great deal of personal
information on its users including--the location (e.g., city or state),
age, sex, birthday, ``Interested in'' responses (i.e., whether a user
is interested in men or women), Relationship Status, Likes and
Interests, Education (e.g., level of education, current enrollment in
high school or college, affiliation with a particular college, and
choice of major in college), and name of employer of individuals.
Do you collect any other specific information you have on
individual Facebook users?
Answer. In response to your specific questions, depending on which
Services a person uses, we collect different kinds of information from
or about them. This is described in our Data Policy:
Things you and others do and provide. Information and
content you provide. We collect the content, communications and
other information you provide when you use our Products,
including when you sign up for an account, create or share
content, and message or communicate with others. This can
include information in or about the content you provide (like
metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file
was created. It can also include what you see through features
we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things like
suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips
on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process
content and communications you and others provide to analyze
context and what's in them for the purposes described below.
Learn more about how you can control who can see the things you
share.
Data with special protections: You can choose to
provide information in your Facebook profile fields or Life
Events about your religious views, political views, who you
are ``interested in,'' or your health. This and other
information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical
beliefs or trade union membership) could be subject to
special protections under the laws of your country.
Networks and connections. We collect information about the
people, Pages, accounts, hashtags, and groups you are connected
to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as
people you communicate with the most or groups you are part of.
We also collect contact information if you choose to upload,
sync or import it from a device (such as an address book or
call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like
helping you and others find people you may know and for the
other purposes listed below.
Your usage. We collect information about how you use our
Products, such as the types of content you view or engage with;
the features you use; the actions you take; the people or
accounts you interact with; and the time, frequency and
duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're
using and have last used our Products, and what posts, videos
and other content you view on our Products. We also collect
information about how you use features like our camera.
Information about transactions made on our Products. If you
use our Products for purchases or other financial transactions
(such as when you make a purchase in a game or make a
donation), we collect information about the purchase or
transaction. This includes payment information, such as your
credit or debit card number and other card information; other
account and authentication information; and billing, shipping
and contact details.
Things others do and information they provide about you. We
also receive and analyze content, communications and
information that other people provide when they use our
Products. This can include information about you, such as when
others share or comment on a photo of you, send a message to
you, or upload, sync, or import your contact information.
Device Information. As described below, we collect
information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs
and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our
Products, and we combine this information across different
devices you use. For example, we use information collected
about your use of our Products on your phone to better
personalize the content (including ads) or features you see
when you use our Products on another device, such as your
laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in
response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a different
device.
Information we obtain from these devices includes:
Device attributes: information such as the operating
system, hardware and software versions, battery level,
signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app
and file names and types, and plugins.
Device operations: information about operations and
behaviors performed on the device, such as whether a window
is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which
can help distinguish humans from bots).
Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other
identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts you use,
and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to
Facebook Company Products associated with the same device
or account).
Device signals: Bluetooth signals, and information
about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers.
Data from device settings: information you allow us to
receive through device settings you turn on, such as access
to your GPS location, camera, or photos.
Network and connections: information such as the name
of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile
phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some
cases, information about other devices that are nearby or
on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a
video from your phone to your TV.
Cookie data: data from cookies stored on your device,
including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about how we
use cookies in the Facebook Cookies Policy (available at
https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/) and Instagram
Cookies Policy (available at https://www.instagram.com/
legal/cookies/).
Information from partners. Advertisers, app developers, and
publishers can send us information through Facebook Business
Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the Like
button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook
pixel. These partners provide information about your activities
off Facebook--including information about your device, websites
you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use
their services--whether or not you have a Facebook account or
are logged into Facebook. For example, a game developer could
use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could
tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive
information about your online and offline actions and purchases
from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide
us with your information. Partners receive your data when you
visit or use their services or through third parties they work
with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights
to collect, use, and share your data before providing any data
to us.
Question 73. Are you tracking and collecting information and data
from within your messenger chat tool? If so, what specific data are you
collecting?
Answer. See Response to Question 72.
Question 74. What about your other platforms, like Instagram, what
type of data are you tracking there?
Answer. Our Instagram Data Policy describes the data we collect and
is available at https://help.instagram.com/519522125107875.
Question 75. Are you preserving broad and full conversations?
Answer. See Response to Question 72 and 74.
Question 76. Is that something you would have available to provide
law enforcement?
Answer. We reach out to law enforcement if we learn of content that
we believe reflects a credible threat of imminent harm. We have been
able to provide support to authorities around the world that are
responding to the threat of terrorism, including in cases where law
enforcement has been able to disrupt attacks and prevent harm. Further,
as part of official investigations, government officials sometimes
request data about people who use Facebook. We have strict processes in
place to handle these government requests, and we disclose account
records in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. We
publish more information on the standards that govern our release of
information to law enforcement in our Law Enforcement Guidelines at
https://www.facebook.com/safety/groups/law/guidelines/, and release
statistics on the frequency with which we receive and comply with law
enforcement requests at https://transparency.facebook.com/.
Question 77. Data Protection on Facebook: Has Facebook ever
launched a feature that had to be turned off because of the privacy
implications?
Answer. Protecting people's information is at the heart of
everything we do, and as our CEO has recently stated, we are serious
about doing what it takes to protect our community. We have developed
extensive systems and processes that are designed to protect our data
and user data, to prevent data loss, to disable undesirable accounts
and activities on our platform, and to prevent or detect security
breaches. In addition to comprehensive privacy reviews, we put products
through rigorous data security testing. We also meet with regulators,
legislators, and privacy experts around the world to get input on our
data practices and policies.
At Facebook, we make decisions about privacy through a cross-
functional, cross-disciplinary effort that involves participants from
departments across the company. This process is a collaborative
approach to privacy that seeks to promote strong privacy protections
and sound decision making at every stage of the product development
process. Our privacy program is responsible for reviewing product
launches, major changes, and privacy-related bug fixes to products and
features to ensure that privacy policies and procedures are
consistently applied and that key privacy decisions are implemented for
the product. This approach has several key benefits.
First, it is designed to consider privacy early in the
product development process. This allows us to consider the
benefits that a feature is intended to have for people who use
our services, how data will be used to deliver those benefits,
and how we can build features from the ground up that include
privacy protections to enable those benefits while protecting
people's information and putting them in control.
Second, while complying with our obligations is critically
important, taking a cross-disciplinary approach to privacy
encourages us to think about data protection as more than just
a compliance exercise. Instead, we evaluate how to design
privacy into the features that we build, and consider this from
the perspective of things like how we design interfaces that
make data use intuitive, taking a consistent approach to
privacy across our services, and building protections in how
our software is engineered. Accordingly, while we scale our
privacy review process depending on the complexity of a
particular data use, reviews typically involve experts who
evaluate proposed data practices from the perspective of
multiple disciplines.
As part of our consent agreement with the Federal Trade Commission,
we submit a report to the FTC every two years. That report is based on
assessments conducted by an independent third party on a biennial
basis, which require us to submit evidence to demonstrate the
effectiveness of the program.
Question 78. If so, how many times has that happened, and how many
users were impacted?
Answer. See Response to Question 77.
Question 79. Did you notify the users who were impacted?
Answer. See Response to Question 78.
Question 80. Facebook tracking software: How many websites have
Facebook tracking software on them?
Answer. Facebook does not publish tracking software. When people
visit apps or websites that feature our technologies--like the Facebook
Like or Comment button--our servers automatically log (i) standard
browser or app records of the fact that a particular device or user
visited the website or app (this connection to Facebook's servers
occurs automatically when a person visits a website or app that
contains our technologies, such as a Like button, and is an inherent
function of Internet design); and (ii) any additional information the
publisher of the app or website chooses to share with Facebook about
the person's activities on that site (such as the fact that a purchase
was made on the site). This is a standard feature of the Internet, and
most websites and apps share this same information with multiple
different third-parties whenever people visit their website or app. For
example, the Senate Commerce Committee's website shares information
with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick and with the analytics
company Webtrends. This means that, when a person visits the
Committee's website, it sends browser information about their visit to
each one of those third parties. More information about how this works
is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-
facebook/.
During the week prior to April 16, 2018, on sites that use Facebook
services, the Like button appeared on 8.4 million websites, the Share
button on 931,000 websites covering 275 million webpages, and there
were 2.2 million Facebook pixels installed on websites.
Question 81. What percentage of all Internet sites have Facebook
tracking software?
Answer. See Response to Question 80.
Question 82. Do you track users even when they are logged out from
Facebook?
Answer. When people visit apps or websites that feature our
technologies--like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers
automatically log (i) standard browser or app records of the fact that
a particular device or user visited the website or app (this connection
to Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a
website or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button,
and is an inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any
additional information the publisher of the app or website chooses to
share with Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as
the fact that a purchase was made on the site). (See https://
www.facebook.com/policies/cookies). This is a standard feature of the
Internet, and most websites and apps share this same information with
multiple different third-parties whenever people visit their website or
app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's website shares
information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick and with the
analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a person visits the
Committee's website, it sends browser information about their visit to
each one of those third parties. More information about how this works
is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-
facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for this
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us
in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First, these logs are
critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to detecting or
preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser has visited
hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign the device
might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a potentially
inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to register for an
account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide summaries and
insights to websites and apps about how many people visit or use their
product, or use specific features like our Like button--but without
providing any information about a specific person. We do not create
profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use browser and app logs for
non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from our advertisers to them or
otherwise seek to personalize the content they see. However, we may
take the opportunity to show a general ad that is unrelated to the
attributes of the person or an ad encouraging the non-user to sign up
for Facebook.
When the individual is a Facebook user, we are also able to use
this information to personalize their experiences on Facebook, whether
or not they are logged out, but we will not target ads to users relying
on this information unless the user allows this in their privacy
settings.
We do not sell or share this information with third parties.
Question 83. Do you collect data on people who have chosen not to
use Facebook?
Answer. See Response to Question 82.
Question 84. How is this data used?
Answer. See Response to Question 83.
Question 85. Does it inform a user's ``interests'' on Facebook?
Answer. See Response to Question 83.
Question 86. If it does inform a user's ``interests'', was any of
the data collected passively from users while they were browsing sites
outside of Facebook passed to Cambridge Analytica?
Answer. No. Kogan's app did not have access to advertising
interests data or browser logs.
Question 87. When the option or opportunity was previously
available for folks to get the user data of individuals' friends, what
was the total pool of data points one could obtain of friends, or was
it all the exact same?
Answer. In April 2014, we announced that we would more tightly
restrict our platform APIs to prevent abuse. At that time we made clear
that existing apps would have a year to transition--at which point they
would be forced (1) to migrate to the more restricted API and (2) be
subject to Facebook's new review and approval protocols. A small number
of developers asked for and were granted short-term extensions beyond
the one-year transition period, the longest of which lasted several
months. These extensions ended several years ago. A transition period
of this kind is standard when platforms implement significant changes
to their technology base and was necessary here to avoid disrupting the
experience of millions of people. New apps that launched after April
30, 2014 were required to use our more restrictive platform APIs, which
incorporated several key new elements, including:
Institution of a review and approval process, called App
Review (also called Login Review), for any app seeking to
operate on the new platform that would request access to data
beyond the user's own public profile, e-mail address, and a
list of friends of the user who had installed and authorized
the same app;
Generally preventing new apps on the new platform from
accessing friends data without review; and
Providing users with even more granular controls over their
permissions as to what categories of their data an app
operating on the new platform could access.
Our investigation is ongoing and as part of it we are taking a
close look at applications that had access to friends data under Graph
API v.1.0 before we made technical changes to our platform to change
this access.
Question 88. Why did you change the policy of getting access to
friends back in 2015?
Answer. See Response to Question 87.
Question 89. Quality Assurance--Policy changes within the company:
What kind of privacy review is required to make a change to the
Facebook platform?
Answer. See Response to Question 77.
Question 90. Is this review of platform changes mandatory? If so,
when did that level of review become mandatory?
Answer. See Response to Question 77.
Question 91. Before that level of review was required, what checks
were in place to ensure that new features wouldn't adversely impact
users' privacy?
Answer. See Response to Question 77.
Question 92. What level of employee seniority was required of
employees to approve a launch of such a privacy-impacting feature? For
example, have you ever let an intern make changes that impact people's
privacy?
Answer. See Response to Question 77.
Question 93. The Cambridge Analytica Data: Given the confessions
made in undercover clips, and the means by which Cambridge Analytica
obtained and used Facebook data, would you ever allow them broad access
to your platform's user data again?
Answer. No. Facebook banned Cambridge Analytica from our service.
We understand that the company is now defunct.
Question 94. Do you believe they have violated the Federal Trade
Commission Act and its broad prohibition against ``unfair and deceptive
acts and practices'' by misrepresenting the terms of their Facebook
app?
Answer. Facebook has not violated the Federal Trade Commission Act.
Facebook is not in a position to determine whether third-party app
developers violated the Act and leaves that determination to the FTC,
although we can confirm that misrepresenting the terms of an app to
users is a violation of Facebook's developer policies.
Question 95. Previously, would you request an app developer or
academic researcher outline any contractual or other association with
outside entities--such as foreign nationals or states, or other
potentially dangerous private operations? Are you doing so now?
Answer. In November 2013, when Kogan's app first became active on
the platform, apps generally could be launched on the Facebook Platform
without affirmative review or approval by Facebook. Kogan's app used
the Facebook Login service, which allowed users to utilize their
Facebook credentials to authenticate themselves to third-party
services. Facebook Login and Facebook's Graph API also allowed Kogan's
app to request permission from its users to access certain categories
of data that users had entered into their Facebook profiles, as well as
certain data their friends had shared with them, if enabled by these
friends' privacy settings.
The App Review process introduced in 2014 requires developers who
create an app that asks for more than certain basic user information
from installers to justify the data they are looking to collect and how
they are going to use it. Facebook then reviews whether the developer
has a legitimate need for the data in light of how the app functions.
Only if approved following such review can the app ask for users'
permission to get their data. Facebook has rejected more than half of
the apps submitted for App Review between April 2014 and April 2018.
We are in the process of investigating every app that had access to
a large amount of information before we changed our Platform in 2014.
Where we have concerns, we will conduct interviews, make requests for
information (RFI)--which ask a series of detailed questions about the
app and the data it has access to--and perform audits that may include
on-site inspections. If we determine that there has been improper use
of data, we will ban those developers and notify everyone affected.
Facebook is launching the Data Abuse Bounty to reward people who report
any misuse of data by app developers. The Data Abuse Bounty, inspired
by the existing bug bounty program that we use to uncover and address
security issues, will help us identify violations of our policies.
Further, Facebook's Platform Policy makes clear to app developers
the relevant requirements regarding users' privacy that apply to apps
operating on the Platform, including the requirements to give users
choice and control, and to respect user privacy. Application developers
explicitly agree to Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities
and Platform Policy when they set up their Facebook accounts. The
Platform Policy imposes a variety of obligations on app developers
regarding the features, functionality, data collection and usage, and
content for apps on the Platform, as well as Facebook's right to take
enforcement action if an application violates the Platform Policy.
Prior to the introduction of App review in 2014, the Facebook
Platform Policy, included provisions to the following effect:
Give People Control: Section 2(8): Delete all of a person's
data you have received from us (including friend data) if that
person asks you to . . .
Protect Data: Section 3(3): Only use friend data (including
friends list) in the person's experience in your app.
Protect Data: Section 3(10): Don't transfer any data you
receive from us (including anonymous, aggregate, or derived
data) to any ad network, data broker or other advertising or
monetization-related service.
Login: Section 7(4): Request only the data and publishing
permission your app needs.
The Platform Policy also outlined the actions Facebook could take
for violations of the policy:
Things You Should Know: Section 6(8): We can audit your app
to ensure it is safe and does not violate our terms. If
requested, you must provide us with proof that your app
complies with our terms.
Things You Should Know: Section 6(15): We may enforce
against your app or website if we conclude that your app
violated our terms or is negatively impacting the Platform. We
may or may not notify you in advance.
Things You Should Know: Section 6(16): Enforcement is both
automated and manual, and can include disabling your app,
restricting you and your app's access to Platform
functionality, requiring that you delete data, terminating
agreements with you or any other action we deem appropriate.
Question 96. Do you know exactly how much Kogan profited from the
data he provided to Cambridge Analytica and any other entities?
Answer. GSR certified to Facebook that it received payments
totaling approximately 750,000 GBP from SCL for services relating to
Kogan's modeling and use of data gathered by his app. The certification
also stated that Kogan used the proceeds to operate GSR. Recently,
Kogan has stated publicly that the above payment came from SCL. Kogan
has also recently testified to the UK Parliament that GSR received
additional payments not reflected in his certification to 1Facebook.
Question 97. From your understanding, was Kogan on payroll with
Cambridge Analytica when he ran the personality app on Facebook?
Answer. Kogan has testified that he was not on Cambridge
Analytica's payroll when he shared data and provided services to
Cambridge Analytica. Rather, Kogan testified that he owned GSR, which
entered into an agreement with Cambridge Analytica to provide it with
services relating to certain Facebook data.
Question 98. Did Facebook make any attempt to pro-actively contact
the 87 million users you say had their data harvested by Cambridge
Analytica in the more than two years after you were alerted to the
breach? If not, why not?
Answer. When Facebook learned about Kogan's breach of Facebook's
data use policies in December 2015, we took immediate action. We
retained an outside firm to assist in investigating Kogan's actions, to
demand that Kogan and each party he had shared data with delete the
data and any derivatives of the data, and to obtain certifications that
they had done so. Because Kogan's app could no longer collect most
categories of data due to changes in Facebook's platform, the company's
highest priority at that time was ensuring deletion of the data that
Kogan may have accessed before these changes took place. With the
benefit of hindsight, we wish we had notified people whose information
may have been impacted. Facebook has since notified all people
potentially impacted with a detailed notice at the top of their News
Feed.
Question 99. Why did Facebook hire Joseph Chancellor, who was the
business partner of Aleksandr Kogan, around the same time as the
Guardian article alerted you to the violation of your policies?
Answer. Mr. Chancellor is a quantitative researcher on the User
Experience Research team at Facebook, whose work focuses on aspects of
virtual reality. We are investigating Mr. Chancellor's prior work with
Kogan through counsel.
Question 100. Why do you continue to employ him to this day?
Answer. See Response to Question 99.
Question 101. Did any of the Facebook employees who were embedded
with the Trump presidential campaign have any sense that they were
helping target ads with data that was obtained through these
disreputable means?
Answer. While our investigation is ongoing, our review indicates
that Facebook employees did not identify any issues involving the
improper use of Facebook data in the course of their interactions with
Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign. No one
from Facebook was assigned full time to the Trump campaign.
Question 102. Is there no way any red flags would have arisen from
how either good the targeting data was, or the way they were using it?
Answer. We expect that advertisers will use targeted advertising,
and many political campaigns use custom audiences. The fact that a
campaign used a custom audience and the performance of that audience
would not normally be an indicator of any wrongdoing.
Question 103. To your knowledge, what foreign actors or entities
may have accessed the same level of data that Cambridge Analytica has
utilized?
Answer. Kogan represented that, in addition to providing data to
his Prosociality and Well-Being Laboratory at the University of
Cambridge for the purposes of research, GSR provided some Facebook data
to SCL Elections Ltd., Eunoia Technologies, and the Toronto Laboratory
for Social Neuroscience at the University of Toronto. Our investigation
is ongoing.
Question 104. Russia: Facebook has downplayed the reach of Russian
advertising during the 2016 election.
But the company's main business model is based on giving ads and
posts prominence in the feeds of well-targeted users.
Has Facebook performed any analyses that looks at smaller groups of
people and how effective those ads were against targeted groups? If so,
can Facebook share that information?
Answer. We learned from press accounts and statements by
congressional leaders that Russian actors might have tried to interfere
in the 2016 election by exploiting Facebook's ad tools. This is not
something we had seen before, and so we started an investigation. We
found that fake accounts associated with the IRA spent approximately
$100,000 on around 3,500 Facebook and Instagram ads between June 2015
and August 2017. Our analysis also showed that these accounts used
these ads to promote the roughly 120 Facebook Pages they had set up,
which in turn posted more than 80,000 pieces of content between January
2015 and August 2017. The Facebook accounts that appeared tied to the
IRA violated our policies because they came from a set of coordinated,
inauthentic accounts. We shut these accounts down and began trying to
understand how they misused our platform. We shared the ads we
discovered with Congress, in a manner that is consistent with our
obligations to protect user information, to help government authorities
complete the vitally important work of assessing what happened in the
2016 election.
Question 105. Do your company's records show that Russia-backed ads
and posts reached a higher number of people in certain states or
regions of the United States?
Answer. Approximately 25 percent of the ads that we've identified
and turned over to the Committee were geographically targeted to a
region smaller than the United States. The ads (along with the
targeting information) are publicly available at https://
democratsintelligence.house.gov/facebook-ads/social-media-
advertisements.htm.
Question 106. If so, how responsive were Facebook users in those
targeted regions to the Russian posts and ads?
Answer. Below is an overview of our analysis to date of the IRA's
ads:
Impressions (an ``impression'' is how we count the number of
times something is on screen, for example this can be the
number of times something was on screen in a person's News
Feed)
44 percent of total ad impressions were before the
U.S. election on November 8, 2016.
56 percent of total ad impressions were after the
election
Reach (the number of people who saw a story at least once):
We estimate 11.4 million people in the U.S. saw at
least one of these ads between 2015 and 2017.
Ads with zero impressions:
Roughly 25 percent of the ads were never shown to
anyone. That's because advertising auctions are designed so
that ads reach people based on relevance, and certain ads
may not reach anyone as a result.
Amount spent on ads:
For 50 percent of the ads, less than $3 was spent.
For 99 percent of the ads, less than $1,000 was spent.
Many of the ads were paid for in Russian currency,
though currency alone is a weak signal for suspicious
activity.
Content of ads:
Most of the ads appear to focus on divisive social and
political messages across the ideological spectrum,
touching on topics from LGBT matters to race issues to
immigration to gun rights.
A number of the ads encourage people to follow Pages
on these issues, which in turn produced posts on similarly
charged subjects.
We estimate that roughly 29 million people were served content in
their News Feeds directly from the IRA's 80,000 posts over the two
years. Posts from these Pages were also shared, liked, and followed by
people on Facebook, and, as a result, three times more people may have
been exposed to a story that originated from the Russian operation. Our
best estimate is that approximately 126 million people may have been
served content from a Page associated with the IRA at some point during
the two-year period. This equals about four-thousandths of one percent
(0.004 percent) of content in News Feed, or approximately 1 out of
23,000 pieces of content. While our data on Instagram is less complete,
we believe another 16 million saw the IRA's Instagram posts starting in
October 2016. Prior to that time, when our data is less incomplete, we
believe another 4 million people may have seen this content.
Question 107. When did anyone at Facebook become aware that
Russians or other foreign nationals were running ads in connection with
the election?
Answer. See Response to Question 104.
Question 108. What happened with that information and what was
done?
Answer. See Response to Question 104.
Question 109. FEC: Has anyone raised or approached you about
potential infractions of any election laws that obtaining or using
Facebook's data might be linked to including Cambridge Analytica's use
of Facebook data?
Answer. We have a compliance team that trains our sales
representatives to comply with all Federal election law requirements in
this area. We also have processes designed to identify inauthentic and
suspicious activity and we also maintain a sanctions compliance program
to screen advertisers and paid app developers. Facebook's denied party
screening protocol involves checking paid app developers and
advertisers against applicable denied party listings. Those screened
remain in an on-going monitoring portfolio and are screened against
changes to applicable denied party listings. Moreover, our payments
subsidiaries file Suspicious Activity Reports on developers of certain
apps as appropriate. However, like other offline and online companies,
Facebook has limited insight into the use of shell corporations or
other sophisticated structures that may disguise the true buyer. In
addition, the general challenge of attributing online activities to
specific governments or organizations is widely recognized in the
intelligence and law enforcement communities.
Question 110. We are now learning that there is reason to believe
that Cambridge Analytica and its foreign national employees
participated in the decision making of its U.S. political committee
clients, possibly in violation of our campaign finance law.\9\ What
steps will you take to determine whether the companies behind political
or issue ads posted on Facebook are not in violation of our campaign
finance laws?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ http://fortune.com/2018/03/26/watchdog-alleges-cambridge-
analytica-violated-election-law/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. See Response to Question 109.
Question 111. Will you undergo this examination before these ads
are allowed to be posted on your platform?
Answer. See Response to Question 109.
Question 112. Technological Capabilities or Limitations to
Protecting Data: Is it fair to say that not only were you not vigilant
in following up or tracking those who have assessed Facebook's data,
but that you have no technical solutions to track data activity once
it's outside your network, such as specialty whether it's properly
deleted?
Answer. We use a variety of tools to enforce Facebook policies
against violating parties, including developers. We review tens of
thousands of apps per year and regularly disapprove noncompliant apps
as part of our proactive review process. We also use tools like cease
and desist letters, account suspensions, letter agreements, and civil
litigation. For example, since 2006, Facebook has sent over 1,150
cease-and-desist letters to over 1,600 targets. In 2017, we took action
against about 370,000 apps, ranging from imposing certain restrictions
to removal of the app from the platform. Moreover, we have required
parties who have procured our data without authorization to delete that
data. We have invested significant resources in these efforts. Facebook
is presently investigating apps that had access to large amounts of
information before we changed our platform policies in 2014 to
significantly reduce the data apps could access. To date, around 200
apps (from a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You, the Cambridge
Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality) have been suspended pending a
thorough investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data.
Question 113. Or at least without a formal deep audit?
Answer. See Response to Question 112.
Question 114. What are the specific aspects of a formal audit,
including the technical capabilities?
Answer. With respect to our audit of all apps that had access to
large amounts of information before we changed our platform policies in
2014, where we have concerns that data may have been shared outside the
app in violation of our policies, we will conduct interviews, make
requests for information (RFI)--which ask a series of detailed
questions about the app and the data it has access to--and perform
audits that may include on-site inspections.
Question 115. And still with an audit, can you clarify what level
of detail you have or could find misuse from someone?
Answer. See Response to Question 114.
Question 116. It's being reported, and opined by others in your
field, including former employees of yours, that it's notoriously
difficult to track down and secure personal information once it has
been unleashed.
So that makes it all the more important to be vigilant on the front
end, no?
Answer. In April 2014, we announced that we would more tightly
restrict our platform APIs to prevent abuse. At that time we made clear
that existing apps would have a year to transition--at which point they
would be forced (1) to migrate to the more restricted API and (2) be
subject to Facebook's new review and approval protocols. A small number
of developers asked for and were granted short-term extensions beyond
the one-year transition period, the longest of which lasted several
months. These extensions ended several years ago. A transition period
of this kind is standard when platforms implement significant changes
to their technology base and was necessary here to avoid disrupting the
experience of millions of people. New apps that launched after April
30, 2014 were required to use our more restrictive platform APIs. We
required apps seeking additional categories of data to undergo
proactive review by our internal teams. We rejected more than half of
the apps seeking these permissions, including the second version of
Kogan's app.
We review apps to ensure that the requested permissions clearly
improve the user experience and that the data obtained is tied to an
experience within the app. We conduct a variety of manual and automated
checks of applications on the platform for Policy compliance, as well
as random sampling. When we find evidence of or receive allegations of
violations, we investigate and, where appropriate, employ a number of
measures, including restricting applications from our platform,
preventing developers from building on our platform in the future, and
taking legal action where appropriate.
Recently, we announced a number of additional steps we're taking to
address concerns raised by Kogan's app.
Review our platform. We will investigate all apps that had
access to large amounts of data before the platform changes we
announced in 2014, and we will audit any app where we identify
suspicious activity. If we identify misuses of data, we'll take
immediate action, including banning the app from our platform
and pursuing legal action if appropriate.
Tell people about data misuse. We will tell people about
apps that have misused their data. This includes building a way
for people to know if their data might have been accessed via
the app. Moving forward, if we remove an app for misusing data,
we will tell everyone who used it.
Turn off access for unused apps. If someone has not used an
app within the last three months, we will turn off the app's
access to their data.
Restrict Facebook Login data. We are changing Login, so that
the only data that an app can request without app review will
include name, profile photo, and e-mail address. Requesting any
other data will require approval from Facebook. We will also no
longer allow apps to ask for access to information like
religious or political views, relationship status and details,
custom friends lists, education and work history, fitness
activity, book reading and music listening activity, news
reading, video watch activity, and games activity. We will
encourage people to manage the apps they use. We already show
people what apps their accounts are connected to and allow them
to control what data they've permitted those apps to use. But
we're making it easier for people to see what apps they use and
the information they have shared with those apps.
Reward people who find vulnerabilities. We launched the Data
Abuse Bounty program so that people can report to us any
misuses of data by app developers.
Update our policies. We have updated our terms and Data
Policy to explain how we use data and how data is shared with
app developers.
Question 117. How much do you anticipate Facebook will be investing
in your investigations or audits into app developers, and others who
have had access to user data?
How much value would you estimate that Facebook has lost through
this latest string of controversies, and the Cambridge Analytica data
security issue?
Answer. We are investing so much in security that our costs will
increase significantly. But we want to be clear about what our priority
is: protecting our community is more important than maximizing our
profits.
Question 118. And how much personally to do suspect you've lost?
Answer. See Response to Question 117.
Question 119. What personal data of yours, or say your wife's, is
available or exploitable on any of the platforms you run?
Answer. Mark Zuckerberg's data was among the data that was shared
with Kogan's app, which may have been improperly shared with Cambridge
Analytica.
Question 120. Seems like millions, or even billions, spent earlier
and being proactively protective would, or could have, saved tens of
billions overall, wouldn't you agree?
Answer. See Response to Question 116.
Question 121. Do you think there's enough accountability at all
levels within Facebook, including for yourself, Ms. Sandberg, others in
senior positions?
Answer. As our CEO Mark Zuckerberg has said, when you are building
something unprecedented like Facebook, there are going to be mistakes.
What people should hold us accountable for is learning from the
mistakes and continually doing better--and, at the end of the day,
making sure that we're building things that people like and that make
their lives better.
Question 122. The Washington Post has reported that Mr. Kogan says
that none of the data that was taken for research purposes in 2013 was
provided to Cambridge Analytica. He says that after he began working
with Cambridge Analytica, he sent out a new survey to Facebook users,
with new terms of service that allowed for broad uses of the data. That
new survey app collected data from nearly 300,000 Facebook users and
captured data on 30 million of their friends. He says he has deleted
all the data that he obtained from Facebook.
Can Facebook prove all of this as fact or fiction?
Answer. On December 11, 2015, The Guardian published an article
reporting that Kogan and his company, GSR, may have passed information
his app had obtained from Facebook users to SCL Elections Ltd. (SCL)/
Cambridge Analytica. By doing so, Kogan and his company violated
Facebook's Platform Policies, which explicitly prohibited selling or
licensing user data accessed from Facebook and from sharing any user
data accessed from Facebook with any ad network, data broker, or other
advertising or monetization-related service. For this reason, Facebook
immediately banned his app from our platform and launched an
investigation into these allegations. Kogan signed a certification
declaring that he had deleted all data that he obtained through his app
and obtained certifications of deletion from others he had shared data
with, including Cambridge Analytica. In March 2018, new allegations
surfaced that Cambridge Analytica may not have deleted data as it had
represented. Our investigation of these matters is ongoing.
Question 123. Facebook's Definition and Regulatory Positions: Do
you believe you are an actual media entity now?
Answer. Facebook does not create or edit the content that users
share on its Platform, although we do take steps to arrange, rank and
distribute that content to those who are most likely to be interested
in it, or to remove objectionable content from our service. These
activities are protected functions under Communications Decency Act
Section 230 and the First Amendment.
Question 124. Are you solely a tech company?
Answer. We are, first and foremost, a technology company. Facebook
does not create or edit the content that our users published on our
platform. While we seek to be a platform for a broad range of ideas, we
do moderate content in good faith according to published community
standards in order to keep users on the platform safe, reduce
objectionable content, and to make sure users participate on the
platform responsibly.
Question 125. When it comes to news posts and political
advertising, why should Facebook get a regulatory exemption that
traditional media doesn't get?
Answer. Facebook is committed to transparency for all ads,
including ads with political content. Facebook believes that people
should be able to easily understand why they are seeing ads, who paid
for them, and what other ads those advertisers are running. As such,
Facebook only allows authorized advertisers to run ads about elections
or issues that are being debated across the country. In order to be
authorized by Facebook, advertisers will need to confirm their identity
and location. Furthermore, all political ads will include a disclosure
in their election-related ads, which reads: ``Paid for by,'' and when
users click on this disclosure they will be able to see details about
the advertiser. Users will also be able to see an explanation of why
they saw the particular ad. This is similar to the disclosure included
on political TV advertisements.
Question 126. Facebook with Law Enforcement: How wide is the use
and specific collection of social media data with law enforcement, say
in a given year? (FBI, CBP, ICE)
Answer. As part of official investigations, government officials
sometimes request data about people who use Facebook. We have strict
processes in place to handle these government requests, and we disclose
account records in accordance with our terms of service and applicable
law. We also have law enforcement response teams available around the
clock to respond to emergency requests. As part of our ongoing effort
to share information about the requests we have received from
governments around the world, Facebook regularly produces a
Transparency Report about government requests to Facebook.
Question 127. Have you seen an increase is such request under the
current Administration?
Answer. See Response to Question 126.
Question 128. Or has there been a variation in the type or
aggressiveness of these requests over the same time?
Answer. See Response to Question 126.
Question 129. Social Media Addiction: Obvious the social media
revolution has brought in a number of addition issues into play that we
in Congress need to consider, from platforms for terrorist
organizations and hate groups, to censorship and online addiction. And
that is something I wanted to inquire about.
I know it was raised by one member during your hearing, but do you
fund any research on the issue of potential social media addiction, and
if not, would you consider funding independent third-party research in
this area?
Answer. Facebook employs social psychologists, social scientists,
and sociologists, and collaborates with top scholars to better
understand well-being. Facebook has also pledged $1 million towards
research to better understand the relationship between media
technologies, youth development and well-being. Facebook is teaming up
with experts in the field to look at the impact of mobile technology
and social media on kids and teens, as well as how to better support
them as they transition through different stages of life. Facebook is
committed to bringing people together and supporting well-being through
meaningful interactions on Facebook.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. Please provide a comprehensive list of all forms of
content or data Facebook collects on Facebook users from the Facebook
platform, whether it is content or data created by the user or not.
Answer. As explained in our Data Policy, we collect three basic
categories of data about people:
(1) data about things people do and share (and who they connect
with) on our services,
(2) data about the devices people use to access our services,
and
(3) data we receive from partners, including the websites and
apps that use our business tools.
As far as the amount of data we collect about people, the answer
depends on the person. People who have only recently signed up for
Facebook have usually shared only a few things--such as name, contact
information, age and gender. Over time, as people use our products, we
receive more data from them, and this data helps us provide more
relevant content and services. That data will fall into the categories
noted above, but the specific data we receive will, in large part,
depend on how the person chooses to use Facebook. For example, some
people use Facebook to share photos, so we receive and store photos for
those people. Some people enjoy watching videos on Facebook; when they
do, we receive information about the video they watched, and we can use
that information to help show other videos in their News Feeds. Other
people seldom or never watch videos, so we do not receive the same kind
of information from them, and their News Feeds are likely to feature
fewer videos.
The data we have about people also depends on how they have used
our controls. For example, people who share photos can easily delete
those photos. The same is true of any other kind of content that people
post on our services. Through Facebook's Activity Log tool, people can
also control the information about their engagement--i.e., their likes,
shares and comments--with other people's posts. The use of these
controls of course affects the data we have about people.
We recently announced improvements to our Download Your Information
tool, as well as a new feature that makes it easier for people to see
the information that's in their account on Facebook. These recently-
expanded tools for accessing information will allow people to see their
data, delete it, and easily download and export it.
Question 2. Please provide a comprehensive list of all ways
Facebook uses each form of content or data. Please provide as much
detail as possible. For example, does Facebook ever use location
information to tell a business that a consumer physically went to a
store after seeing an ad?
Answer. See Response to Question 1.
Question 3. Does Facebook collect or purchase information about
non-Facebook users? If so, what information is collected? How does
Facebook acquire the information? What are all the ways Facebook uses
the information? Please provide a comprehensive list of all forms of
data Facebook collects on individuals, not collected from the Facebook
website.
a. Can a person who does not have a Facebook account request
deletion of any data? How?
b. If Facebook has utilized the information of a person who does
not have an account in any way, such as building advertising profile,
will deletion of the data ensure deletion from advertising profiles or
any other products that the data was used to compile?
Answer. Facebook does not create profiles or track website visits
for people without a Facebook account.
When people visit apps or websites that feature our technologies--
like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers automatically log
(i) standard browser or app records of the fact that a particular
device or user visited the website or app (this connection to
Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a website
or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button, and is an
inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any additional
information the publisher of the app or website chooses to share with
Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as the fact
that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard feature of
the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same information
with multiple different third parties whenever people visit their
website or app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's website
shares information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick and with
the analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a person visits
the Committee's website, it sends browser information about their visit
to each one of those third parties. More information about how this
works is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/data-off-
facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for this
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us--
described above--in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First,
these logs are critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to
detecting or preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser
has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign
the device might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a
potentially inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to
register for an account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide
summaries and insights to websites and apps about how many people visit
or use their product, or use specific features like our Like button--
but without providing any information about a specific person. We do
not create profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use browser and
app logs for non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from our
advertisers to them or otherwise seek to personalize the content they
see. However, we may take the opportunity to show a general ad that is
unrelated to the attributes of the person or an ad encouraging the non-
user to sign up for Facebook.
When the individual is a Facebook user, we are also able to use
this information to personalize their experiences on Facebook, whether
or not they are logged out, but we will not target ads to users relying
on this information unless the user allows this in their privacy
settings. We do not sell or share this information with third-parties.
Question 4. When a user deletes information from Facebook, is that
information still used to inform advertising?
a. If it is, how does the user change this?
b. When a user deletes their Facebook account, is underlying data
still used in any way, including to inform advertising profile? Can the
user prevent any further use?
Answer. The audience with which someone chooses to share their
information is independent of whether we use that information to
personalize the ads and other content we show them. Specifically, our
Data Policy explains that we may use any information that people share
on Facebook ``to deliver our Products, including to personalize
features and content (including your News Feed, Instagram Feed,
Instagram Stories and ads).'' However, people can use our Ad
Preferences tool to see the list of interests that we use to
personalize their advertising. This means that, for example, a person
who is interested in cars can continue to share that interest with
their friends but tell us not to assign them an interest in ads for ad
targeting purposes.
Likewise, the audience of a post does not determine whether a post
is retained. Someone can choose to share a post with ``Only Me''
(meaning that they don't want anyone to see it but want to retain it in
their Facebook account). They may also choose to delete the information
entirely. When people choose to delete something they have shared on
Facebook, we remove it from the site. In most cases, this information
is permanently deleted from our servers; however, some things can only
be deleted when a user permanently deletes their account.
Question 5. How long does Facebook keep a user's data after they
delete their account? Is there any data that is not deleted from
Facebook's servers?
Answer. In general, when a user deletes their account, we delete
things they have posted, such as their photos and status updates, and
they won't be able to recover that information later. (Information that
others have shared about them isn't part of their account and won't be
deleted.)
There are some limited exceptions to these policies: For instance,
information can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when
it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental
investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or
policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from
accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent
repeat abuse or other term violations.
Question 6. In your testimony you stated that the user has complete
control over their Facebook page.
a. Can a user make their profile invisible, so it cannot be found
by searching Facebook or the web?
b. Can a user choose to make their name or picture private?
c. Can a user opt out of specific uses of their data, such as
academic research?
Answer. When someone creates a profile on Facebook, the purpose of
the profile is to enable others on Facebook to see whatever information
the person chooses to add to his or her profile. However, people are in
control of what information they add--only a person's name and limited
other data is required to create a Facebook profile. And, for nearly
all information that people choose to add to their profiles, they can
choose who is eligible to see this information. For example, a person
might choose to share his or her hometown only with his or her friends.
A limited amount of information that people provide--including
their name and, if they choose to add one, their profile photo--is
always public on Facebook. Among other things, this helps us inform a
user before they make or accept a friend request of the identity of the
person with whom he or she is about to connect.
Through Facebook's Settings, people can make a range of choices
about how their information will be used, including instructing that
they do not want search engines to link to their profiles. We inform
people that, even if they choose not to be linked to in search engines,
anyone may see information that they share if they set the audience for
that information to Public.
Question 7. With regard to academic research, you recently updated
your data policy as it was reported that Facebook was looking into
partnering with healthcare providers to conduct medical research.
a. Why was it not disclosed earlier to users that their data could
be used for research?
b. How does a user opt out of being a subject of medical or other
academic research?
c. If they cannot, why not? Will you change this?
Answer. Facebook was exploring this type of data sharing because of
the general health benefits to having a close-knit circle of family and
friends and the need for more research on the impact of social
connection on health. Deeper research into this link is needed to help
medical professionals develop specific treatment and intervention plans
that take social connection into account. With this in mind, last year
Facebook began discussions with leading medical institutions, including
the American College of Cardiology and the Stanford University School
of Medicine, to explore whether scientific research using fully-
anonymized Facebook data could help the medical community advance our
understanding in this area. This work did not progress past the
planning phase, and we have not received, shared, or analyzed anyone's
data.
In March we decided that we should pause these discussions so we
can focus on other important work, including doing a better job of
protecting people's data and being clearer with them about how that
data is used in our products and services.
Our Data Policy has explained that we have engaged in research
collaborations for several years. As part of a general effort to be
more transparent, we updated our Data Policy recently to provide
additional detail on a range of practices, including academic research.
We also explain this in other ways, including announcements in our
Newsroom and in a dedicated website providing more information about
research at Facebook.
Question 8. Does Facebook currently collect, or have any plans to
collect, anonymized medical information of Americans?
a. If so, what are the planned or potential uses of this
information?
Answer. See Response to Question 7.
Question 9. In your testimony you stated that it would be too long
a webpage if you provide a list of all the ways data is used. Is there
a reason you could not have a short, easy to understand list, and a
long comprehensive list for those who are interested to learn more?
Answer. We believe that it's important to communicate with people
about the information that we collect and how people can control it.
This is why we work hard to provide this information to people in a
variety of ways: in our Data Policy, and in Privacy Basics, which
provides walkthroughs of the most common privacy questions we receive.
Beyond simply disclosing our practices, we also think it's important to
give people access to their own information, which we do through our
Download Your Information and Access Your Information tools, Activity
Log, and Ad Preferences, all of which are accessible through our
Privacy Shortcuts tool. We also provide information about these topics
as people are using the Facebook service itself.
Facebook seeks, as much as possible, to put controls and
information in context within its service. While ``up front''
information like that contained in the terms of service are useful,
research overwhelmingly demonstrates that in-product controls and
education are the most meaningful to people and the most likely to be
read and understood. On-demand controls are also important, and we
recently redesigned our entire settings menu on mobile devices from top
to bottom to make things easier to find. We also created a new Privacy
Shortcuts menu where users can control their data in just a few taps,
with clearer explanations of how our controls work. The experience is
now clearer, more visual, and easy-to-find.
Improving people's understanding of how digital services work is an
industry-wide challenge that we are highly committed to addressing.
That's why, over the last 18 months, we've run a global series of
design workshops called ``Design Jams,'' bringing together experts in
design, privacy, law and computer science to work collaboratively on
new and innovative approaches. These workshops have run in Paris,
London, Dublin, Berlin, Sao Paolo, Hong Kong and other cities, and
included global regulators and policymakers. At these workshops, expert
teams use ``people centric design'' methods to create innovative new
design prototypes and experiences to improve transparency and education
in digital services. These workshops inform Facebook's constantly-
improving approach.
In recognition of the need for improved approaches to data
transparency across all digital services, working with partners from
academia, design and industry we recently launched TTC Labs, a design
innovation lab that seeks to improve user experiences around personal
data. TTC Labs is an open platform for sharing and innovation and
contains insights from leading experts in academia, design and law, in
addition to prototype designs from the Design Jams, template services
and open-source toolkits for people-centric design for transparency,
trust and control of data. Working collaboratively, and based on open-
source approaches, TTC Labs seeks to pioneer new and more people-
centric best practices for people to understand how their data is used
by digital services, in ways that they find easy to understand and
control.
Facebook is highly committed to improving people's experience of
its own services as well as investing in new innovations and approaches
to support improvements across the industry.
Question 10. It has been reported that Facebook's download your
information tool, contrary to your testimony, does not contain all the
data Facebook has collected on that individual consumer. Can you
explain that discrepancy? Will you be changing this?
Answer. Our Download Your Information or ``DYI'' tool is Facebook's
data portability tool and was launched many years ago to let people
access and download many types of information that we maintain about
them. The data in DYI and in our Ads Preferences tool contain each of
the interest categories that are used to show people ads, along with
information about the advertisers currently running ads based on their
use of an advertiser's website or app. People also can choose not to
see ads from those advertisers. We recently announced expansions to
Download Your Information, which, among other things, will make it
easier for people to see their data, delete it, and easily download and
export it. More information is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/
news/2018/04/new-privacy-protections/.
Responding to feedback that we should do more to provide
information about websites and apps that send us information when
people use them, we also announced plans to build Clear History. This
new feature will enable users to see the websites and apps that send us
information when they use them, delete this information from their
account, and turn off Facebook's ability to store it associated with
their account going forward.
We have also introduced Access Your Information. This feature
provides a new way for people to access and manage their information.
Users can go here to delete anything from their timeline or profile
that they no longer want on Facebook. They can also see their ad
interests, as well as information about ads they've clicked on and
advertisers who have provided us with information about them that
influence the ads they see. From here, they can go to their ad settings
to manage how this data is used to show them ads.
Question 11. Facebook has previously stated that private messages
are not scanned for advertising, but are scanned for content such as
child pornography and facilitating genocide. Is there any other way in
which private messages are used by Facebook or any third party?
Answer. The way Facebook uses messages can be found in our Data
Policy, located at: https://www.facebook.com/policy.php.
Question 12. When a user logs in to Facebook, does Facebook
continue to track, through cookies or other trading tools, the users
pages visited (a) while the user is still logged onto the Facebook
page, and (b) after the user logs out of the Facebook page?
Answer. See Response to Question 3.
Question 13. Please provide a detailed explanation how Facebook
tracks a user's Internet browsing activity. Where is this disclosed on
the Facebook website and could it be disclosed more fully?
Answer. We do not use web browsing data to show ads to non-users or
otherwise store profiles about non-users. Our goal is to show people
content (including advertising) that is relevant to their interests. We
use information people have provided on Facebook--such as things
they've liked or posts they've engaged with--to help determine what
people will be interested in. Like most online advertising companies,
we also inform our judgments about what ads to show based on apps and
websites that people use off of Facebook. People can completely turn
off our use of web browser data and other data from third-party
partners to show them ads through a control in Ads Preferences. They
can also customize their advertising experience by removing interests
that they do not want to inform the Facebook ads they see. In addition,
a person's browser or device may offer settings that allow users to
choose whether browser cookies are set and to delete them
Question 14. Can people opt-out of being tracked across the Web by
Facebook via cookies and other tracking tools? How?
Answer. See Responses to Questions 10 and 13.
Question 15. Has Facebook been collecting call history and SMS data
from Android phones? If yes, how has it been collected and what is
Facebook doing with this information?
Answer. Call and text history logging is part of an opt-in feature
that lets people import contact information to help them connect with
people they know on Facebook and Messenger. We introduced the call and
text history component this feature for Android users several years
ago, and currently offer it in Messenger and Facebook Lite, a
lightweight version of Facebook, on Android.
Contact importers are fairly common among social apps and services
as a way to more easily find the people users want to connect with.
They help users find and stay connected with the people they care
about, and provide them with a better experience across Facebook.
Before we receive anyone's call and text history, they specifically
grant us permission to access this data on their device and separately
agree to use the feature. If, at any time, they no longer wish to use
this feature, they can turn it off, and all previously shared call and
text history shared via that app is deleted. People can also access
information they previously imported through the Download Your
Information tool.
Question 16. Does Facebook scan users' photos to generate biometric
data on them? Does Facebook scan photos for any reason other than to
match photos based on facial recognition and to search for
inappropriate content?
Answer. Facebook uses facial recognition technology to provide
people with products and features that enhance online experiences for
Facebook users while giving them control over this technology.
Facebook's facial recognition technology helps people tag their friends
in photos; gives people an easier and faster way to privately share
their photos with friends; helps people with visual impairments by
generating descriptions of photos that people using screen readers can
hear as they browse Facebook; lets people know when a photo or video of
them has been uploaded to Facebook, even if they are not tagged; and
helps prevent people from impersonating other Facebook users.
Facial recognition technology uses machine-learning algorithms to
analyze the pixels in photos and videos in which a user is tagged, and
the photo used by the person as his or her profile picture, and
generates a unique number called a template. When a photo or video is
uploaded to Facebook, Facebook uses the template to attempt to identify
someone by determining whether there are any faces in that content, and
analyzing the portion of the image in which the face appears to compare
it against certain Facebook users depending on the purpose for which
facial recognition is being performed.
Facebook has not shared and does not have plans to share or make
available to any third party its facial recognition templates.
Moreover, these templates do not provide meaningful information on
their own; they can be used to identify a person only in conjunction
with Facebook's software. They could not be reverse-engineered to
recreate someone's face.
Facebook designed its facial-recognition technology and the
applications that use it with privacy considerations in mind and
incorporated various safeguards and controls that protect both (1)
users' ability to control the collection, use, and disclosure of their
personal information, and (2) the security of that personal
information.
Facebook gives users control over whether Facebook uses facial
recognition to recognize them in photos and videos. That control is
exercised through users' privacy settings. If a user chooses to turn
facial recognition off, Facebook does not create a template for that
person or deletes any template it has previously created. Facebook will
then be unable to recognize that person in any photos or videos that
are uploaded to the service. Facebook also deletes templates of people
who delete their Facebook accounts. Additionally, Facebook does not
maintain templates for users who have no photos tagged of themselves
and do not have a profile photo that is capable of being used to
generate a face signature or template (e.g., where a user has no
profile photo, where a user's profile photo does not contain a human
face, or where a user's profile photo contains multiple untagged
faces).
We inform people about our use of facial recognition technology
through the Data Policy, Help Center, posts on Facebook, and direct
user notifications. Facebook users are told that they can opt out of
facial recognition at any time--in which case Facebook will delete
their template and will no longer use facial recognition to identify
them.
In creating facial recognition templates, Facebook uses only data
that people have voluntarily provided to Facebook: the photos and
videos that people have voluntarily uploaded to Facebook (including
public profile pictures) and the tags people have applied to those
photos and videos. Facebook does not use facial recognition to identify
someone to a stranger.
Question 17. Does Facebook collect user data through cross-device
tracking? What types of data are collected? If a user accesses their
Facebook account through a mobile device, for example, what information
does Facebook collect about that mobile device? And what access, if
any, does Facebook have to other data located on that user's mobile
device? What are all the ways in which Facebook uses this data?
Answer. Facebook's services inherently operate on a cross-device
basis: understanding when people use our services across multiple
devices helps us provide the same personalized experience wherever
people use Facebook--for example, to ensure that a person's News Feed
or profile contains the same content whether they access our services
on their mobile phone or in a desktop computer's web browser.
In support of those and other purposes, we collect information from
and about the computers, phones, connected TVs and other web-connected
devices our users use that integrate with our Products, and we combine
this information across a user's different devices. For example, we use
information collected about a person's use of our Products on their
phone to better personalize the content (including ads) or features
they see when they use our Products on another device, such as their
laptop or tablet, or to measure whether they took an action in response
to an ad we showed them on their phone or on a different device.
Information we obtain from these devices includes:
Device attributes. Information such as the operating system,
hardware and software versions, battery level, signal strength,
available storage space, browser type, app and file names and
types, and plugins.
Device operations. Information about operations and
behaviors performed on the device, such as whether a window is
foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which can
help distinguish humans from bots).
Identifiers. Unique identifiers, device IDs, and other
identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts people use,
and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to Facebook
Company Products associated with the same device or account).
Device signals. Bluetooth signals, and information about
nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers.
Data from device settings. Information a user allows us to
receive through device settings they turn on, such as access to
their GPS location, camera, or photos.
Network and connections. Information such as the name of a
user's mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile
phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some cases,
information about other devices that are nearby or on their
network, so we can do things like help them stream a video from
their phone to their TV.
Cookie data. Data from cookies stored on a user's device,
including cookie IDs and settings. More information is
available at https://www.facebook.com/policies/cookies/ and
https://help.instagram.com/1896641480634370?ref=ig.
Advertisers, app developers, and publishers can send us information
through Facebook Business Tools they use, including our social plug-ins
(such as the Like button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the
Facebook pixel. These partners provide information about a person's
activities off Facebook--including information about their device,
websites they visit, purchases they make, the ads they see, and how
they use their services--whether or not they have a Facebook account or
are logged into Facebook. For example, a game developer could use our
API to tell us what games a person plays, or a business could tell us
about a purchase a person made in its store. We also receive
information about a person's online and offline actions and purchases
from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide us with
that person's information.
We use the information we have to deliver our Products, including
to personalize features and content (including a person's News Feed,
Instagram Feed, Instagram Stories, and ads) and make suggestions for a
user (such as groups or events they may be interested in or topics they
may want to follow) on and off our Products. To create personalized
Products that are unique and relevant to them, we use their
connections, preferences, interests, and activities based on the data
we collect and learn from them and others (including any data with
special protections they choose to provide); how they use and interact
with our Products; and the people, places, or things they're connected
to and interested in on and off our Products.
For example, if people have shared their device locations with
Facebook or checked into a specific restaurant, we can show them ads
from an advertiser that wants to promote its services in their area or
from the restaurant. We use location-related information--such as a
person's current location, where they live, the places they like to go,
and the businesses and people they're near--to provide, personalize and
improve our Products, including ads, for them and others. Location-
related information can be based on things like precise device location
(if a user has allowed us to collect it), IP addresses, and information
from their and others' use of Facebook Products (such as check-ins or
events they attend). We store data until it is no longer necessary to
provide our services and Facebook Products, or until a person's account
is deleted--whichever comes first. This is a case-by-case determination
that depends on things like the nature of the data, why it is collected
and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. We
provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of people seeing their
ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't share information
that personally identifies someone (information such as a person's name
or e-mail address that by itself can be used to contact them or
identifies who they are) unless they give us permission. For example,
we provide general demographic and interest information to advertisers
(for example, that an ad was seen by a woman between the ages of 25 and
34 who lives in Madrid and likes software engineering) to help them
better understand their audience. We also confirm which Facebook ads
led people to make a purchase or take an action with an advertiser.
Question 18. There remains concern about timely fixes of security
gaps in Facebook. In your written testimony you stated that a feature
that allowed user look-up by phone number or e-mail had been abused to
scrape profiles and that the feature had recently been shut down.
However there are public reports that Facebook was made aware of the
vulnerability as early as 2013.
a. Are these reports accurate?
b. If so, why was the feature not fixed earlier?
c. What steps is Facebook taking to ensure that any abuses of
privacy are dealt with more expeditiously?
Answer. In April, we found out that a feature that lets users look
someone up by their phone number and e-mail may have been misused by
browsers looking up people's profiles in large volumes with phone
numbers they already had. When we found out about the abuse, we shut
this feature down. In the past, we have been aware of scraping as an
industry issue, and have dealt with specific bad actors previously.
Question 19. Does Facebook have a specific review protocol for a
reported data breach or improper data transfer?
Answer. Yes, Facebook maintains a data incident response plan.
a. If not, why not? Will you be establishing one?
Answer. See response above.
b. If so, what is the protocol? Is there a timeline by which a
review should be completed and the vulnerability addressed?
Answer. Facebook monitors its systems for potential breaches of
personal data and logs any potential breach in a system that
automatically triggers expedited review. Facebook reviews such
potential incidents to determine: (i) whether there was in fact an
incident, (ii) its root cause, including short-and long-term
remediation (if applicable); and (iii) our legal and ethical
obligations. Facebook moves quickly to review potential incidents.
Because of the fluid nature of an incident, there are no set timelines
for completion of reviews and addressing of a discovered vulnerability,
but any potential breach is escalated for high priority processing.
c. What are the standards for when and how Facebook will notify
users that their information may have been breached or improperly
transferred?
Answer. Facebook allows people to view, manage, and remove the apps
that they have logged into with Facebook through the App Dashboard. We
recently prompted everyone to review their App Dashboard as a part of a
Privacy Checkup, and we also provided an educational notice on Facebook
to encourage people to review their settings. More information about
how users can manage their app settings is available at https://
www.facebook.com/help/218345114850283?helpref=about_content.
The categories of information that an app can access is clearly
disclosed before the user consents to use an app on the Facebook
platform. Users can view and edit the categories of information that
apps they have used have access to through the App Dashboard.
In addition, Facebook notifies users in accordance with its
obligations under applicable law and has also notified people in cases
where there was no legal obligation to do so but we nevertheless
determined it was the right thing to do under the circumstances.
Question 20. Many of Facebook's vulnerabilities in security or
privacy appear to be reported to Facebook and then addressed. Does
Facebook have a specific proactive team or protocol for finding
security leaks and privacy issues? In short, are there dedicated
resources to seek out privacy issues on the platform? If not, why not?
If so, when was the proactive approach implemented?
Answer. Protecting a global community of more than 2 billion
involves a wide range of teams and functions, and our expectation is
that those teams will grow across the board. For example, we have
dedicated information security and related engineering teams.
Protecting the security of information on Facebook is at the core
of how we operate. Security is built into every Facebook product, and
we have dedicated teams focused on each aspect of data security. From
encryption protocols for data privacy to machine learning for threat
detection, Facebook's network is protected by a combination of advanced
automated systems and teams with expertise across a wide range of
security fields. Our security protections are regularly evaluated and
tested by our own internal security experts and independent third
parties. For the past seven years, we have also run an open bug bounty
program that encourages researchers from around the world to find and
responsibly submit security issues to us so that we can fix them
quickly and better protect the people who use our service.
We anticipate continuing to grow these teams by hiring a range of
experts, including people with specific types of threat intelligence
expertise.
Question 21. How many improper data transfers to third parties have
there been?
a. Was Facebook only made aware of the improper data transfers by a
third party?
b. Have you ever required an audit to ensure the deletion of
improperly transferred data? If so, how many times?
c. Please provide a list of applications that Facebook has
previously banned because data was transferred in violation of
Facebook's terms.
d. Beyond an audit, what tools is Facebook using to proactively
stop improper transfers of data?
e. How are you proactively ensuring that data is not improperly
transferred by third parties in the future?
Answer. We launched an initial investigation after the December 11,
2015 publication of an article in The Guardian about Cambridge
Analytica's potential misuse of Facebook data.
We use a variety of tools to enforce Facebook policies against
violating parties, including developers. We review tens of thousands of
apps per year and regularly disapprove noncompliant apps as part of our
proactive review process. We also use tools like cease and desist
letters, account suspensions, letter agreements, and civil litigation.
For example, since 2006, Facebook has sent over 1,150 cease-and-desist
letters to over 1,600 targets. In 2017, we took action against about
370,000 apps, ranging from imposing certain restrictions to removal of
the app from the platform. Moreover, we have required parties who have
procured our data without authorization to delete that data. We have
invested significant resources in these efforts. Facebook is presently
investigating apps that had access to large amounts of information
before we changed our platform policies in 2014 to significantly reduce
the data apps could access. To date around 200 apps (from a handful of
developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You, the Cambridge Psychometrics Center,
myPersonality, and AIQ) have been suspended--pending a thorough
investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data.
Question 22. In page 3 of your written testimony you state that
``strict requirements'' are going to be put on developers. What are
those strict requirements?
Answer. Recently, we announced a number of additional steps we're
taking to address concerns raised by Kogan's app.
Review our platform. We are investigating all apps that had
access to large amounts of data before the platform changes we
announced in 2014, and we will audit any app where we identify
suspicious activity. If we identify misuses of data, we'll take
immediate action, including banning the app from our platform
and pursuing legal action if appropriate.
Tell people about data misuse. We will tell people about
apps that have misused their data.
Turn off access for unused apps. If someone has not used an
app within the last three months, we will turn off the app's
access to their data.
Restrict Facebook Login data. We are changing Login, so that
the only data that an app can request without app review will
include name, profile photo, and e-mail address. Requesting any
other data will require approval from Facebook. We will also no
longer allow apps to ask for access to information like
religious or political views, relationship status and details,
custom friends lists, education and work history, fitness
activity, book reading and music listening activity, news
reading, video watch activity, and games activity. We will
encourage people to manage the apps they use. We already show
people what apps their accounts are connected to and allow them
to control what data they've permitted those apps to use. But
we're making it easier for people to see what apps they use and
the information they have shared with those apps.
Reward people who find vulnerabilities. We launched the Data
Abuse Bounty program so that people can report to us any
misuses of data by app developers.
Update our policies. We have updated our terms and Data
Policy to explain in more detail how we use data and how data
is shared with app developers.
Question 23. Please list all the companies or persons to whom
Aleksandr Kogan sold Facebook data.
Answer. Kogan represented that, in addition to providing data to
his Prosociality and Well-Being Laboratory at the University of
Cambridge for the purposes of research, GSR provided some Facebook data
to SCL Elections Ltd., Eunoia Technologies, and the Toronto Laboratory
for Social Neuroscience at the University of Toronto. However, the only
party Kogan has claimed paid GSR was SCL. Our investigation is ongoing.
Question 24. Please provide a detailed account of why Facebook did
not detect that Mr. Kogan's user agreement included an agreement for
resale, in violation of Facebook's polices?
Answer. Facebook has developed an automated system for checking
that all apps had terms of service and data policies. In performing
such checks, however, Facebook does not examine the content of the
developers' terms and policies because app developers act as
independent third parties with regard to the data they obtain; they
determine the purposes for which, and the manner in which, that data is
processed. Our understanding is that this is consistent with the
practices of other major online and mobile platforms, which generally
enable developers on their platforms to provide access to the
developers' terms and policies in their app stores, but do not
proactively review the substance of those policies.
Although developers act as independent third parties with regard to
the data users share with them, all apps on the Facebook Platform must
comply with our user data policies, Community Standards, Platform
Policies, and Ad Guidelines. Our Platform policy also contains a number
of enforcement provisions which apply after an app has been reviewed
and approved. Facebook has several teams dedicated to detecting,
escalating, investigating, and combating violations of its policies,
including schemes to improperly access, collect, or exploit user data.
The Developer Operations Policy Enforcement team looks for policy
violations and either brings developers into compliance or removes them
from the platform, and the Developer Operations Review team conducts an
upfront review of apps to confirm proper use of advanced permissions.
Question 25. What information exactly was received by Aleksandr
Kogan? Private messages? Friends of friends' info?
Answer. Approximately 300,000 Facebook users worldwide installed
Kogan's app. For the majority of these users, the app requested consent
to access the following data fields associated with the user and with
the friends of the user: Public profile data, including name and
gender; Birthdate; ``Current city'' in the ``About'' section of the
user's profile, if provided; and Facebook Pages liked.
For a small subset of users, it appears that the app also requested
consent to access users' Facebook messages (fewer than 1,500
individuals, based on current information) and to posts that appeared
in the user's News Feed or Timeline (approximately 100 individuals,
based on current information)--but only for users who installed the
app. For a small subset of users (fewer than 1,500 individuals, based
on current information), it appears that the app also requested consent
to access the hometowns that the users' friends had specified in the
``About'' section of their profiles. And for a handful of people (fewer
than 10) who appear to be associated with Kogan/GSR, the app requested
consent to e-mail address and photos.
Question 26. Does Facebook have any evidence or reason to believe
Cambridge Analytica, GSR, or Kogan, retained Facebook data after they
certified they had deleted it?
Answer. In March 2018, we learned from news reports that contrary
to the certifications given, not all of the Kogan data may have been
deleted by Cambridge Analytica. We have no direct evidence of this and
no way to confirm this directly without accessing Cambridge Analytica's
systems and conducting a forensic audit. We have held off on audits of
Cambridge Analytica and other parties that are being investigated by
the UK Information Commissioner's Office at its request. Our
investigation is ongoing.
Question 27. Are you currently engaged in any industry-wide
conversations about setting best practices for disclosures of data
collection and use, privacy policy settings, and/or proactively
discovering privacy lapses? If not, why not? If so, will a public
report be generated? If so, when?
Answer. We regularly consult with a range of experts in our effort
to deliver and improve the strong privacy protections that people who
use Facebook expect. This includes regular consultation with privacy
experts, academics, other companies, and industry groups. While we
recognize that there is no one-size-fits-all approach to strong privacy
protections, we believe that these ongoing discussions better enable us
to design our services in a way that responds to the feedback we're
receiving, as well as new research and best practices around privacy.
Question 28. Please provide a detailed breakdown of the principles
that will guide the development of artificial intelligence (AI)
practices, the details about what those practices are, and how they'll
help users.
Answer. We are focused on both the technical and the ethical
aspects of artificial intelligence. We believe these should go hand-in-
hand together in order to fulfill our commitment to being fair,
transparent, and accountable in our development and use of AI. Facebook
has AI teams working on developing the philosophical, as well as
technical, foundations for this work. Facebook is also one of the co-
founders and members of the Partnership on AI (PAI), a collaborative
and multi-stakeholder organization established to study and formulate
best practices on AI technologies, to advance the public's
understanding of AI, and to serve as an open platform for discussion
and engagement about AI and its influences on people and society. The
thematic pillars that structure the work we're doing in the scope of
the PAI--safety, fairness, transparenc,y and accountability--are the
principles that we believe industry should follow and promote when
building and deploying AI systems. The PAI's Fair, Transparent and
Accountable AI Working Group is also working alongside industry,
academia and civil society to develop best practices around the
development and fielding of fair, explainable, and accountable AI
systems.
a. Many are skeptical AI will be a cure-all for content issues.
Facebook has also announced it will hire more content reviewers. Does
Facebook have any other plans to deal with content review?
Answer. We believe that over the long term, building AI tools is
the scalable way to identify and root out most of this harmful content.
We're investing a lot in building those tools. And we already use
artificial intelligence to help us identify threats of real world harm
from terrorists and others. For example, the use of AI and other
automation to stop the spread of terrorist content is showing promise.
Today, 99 percent of the ISIS and Al Qaeda related terror content we
remove from Facebook is content we detect before anyone in our
community has flagged it to us, and in some cases, before it goes live
on the site. We do this primarily through the use of automated systems
like photo and video matching and text-based machine learning. We also
use AI to help find child exploitation images, hate speech,
discriminatory ads, and other prohibited content. Moreover, in the last
year, we have basically doubled the number of people doing security and
content review. We will have more than 20,000 people working on
security and content review by the end of this year.
b. You have offered a ``bounty'' for information about improperly
transferred user data. Are you concerned this bounty program may
promote the hacking of third-party app developers? Could offering small
bounties for finding hate speech, terrorism, etc. encourage more user
reporting on the platform?
Answer. The Data Abuse Bounty Program is carefully designed to help
us lawfully obtain data necessary to review apps that are operating
from malicious intent of their developers. The program does not reward
reports that were a direct or indirect result of hacking of third-party
app developers. We made this explicitly clear in the terms of the
program. Following an investigation, we will reward a submission only
if the report is genuine, based on direct and personal knowledge, and
the information was obtained lawfully. To prevent abuse, we require the
submission to be submitted in narrative form without any data appended.
We will request data only if we need it and we are absolutely confident
that the reporter obtained it and can share it lawfully.
The Data Abuse Bounty will reward people with first-hand knowledge
and proof of cases where a Facebook platform app collects and transfers
people's data to another party to be sold, stolen or used for scams or
political influence. We'll review all legitimate reports and respond as
quickly as possible when we identify a credible threat to people's
information. If we confirm data abuse, we will shut down the offending
app and, if necessary, take legal action against the company selling or
buying the data. We'll pay a bounty to the person who reported the
issue, or allow them to donate their bounty to a charity, and we'll
also alert those we believe to be affected. We also encourage our users
to report to us content that they find concerning or that results in a
bad experience, as well as other content that may violate our policies.
We review these reports and take action on abuse, like removing content
and disabling accounts.
Question 29. Do you have a specific office that can respond to
users' complaints and questions regarding privacy? If so, how is this
office advertised? Could it be made more accessible to the public and
or better equipped? If you have no such office, why not?
Answer. Yes. In addition to the range of online educational
resources that we provide through our website and mobile apps, we have
staff responsible for responding to questions from people about
privacy. We distribute the contact information for this team in a
number of ways, including in the section of our Data Policy that begins
with the heading, ``How to contact Facebook with questions.''
Question 30. What assistance do Facebook employees embedded with
advertising and political clients provide?
Answer. Facebook representatives advise political advertisers on
Facebook, as they would with other, non-political managed accounts.
During the 2016 election cycle, for example, Facebook provided
technical support and best practices guidance on optimizing their use
of Facebook.
a. Is there any way these embedded persons could bypass a security
or privacy feature?
b. Has Facebook investigated whether any Facebook personnel
assisting the Obama campaign violated any Facebook policies?
c. What protocols are in place to make sure these embedded persons
cannot take any steps to bypass privacy or security controls on
Facebook?
Answer. Both the Obama and Romney campaigns had access to the same
tools, and no campaign received any special treatment from Facebook. We
continuously work to ensure that we comply with all applicable laws and
policies.
Question 31. You have received numerous questions about removing
conservative content from Facebook. You have answered that these were
enforcement errors.
a. Have you undertaken any study to determine whether any specific
forms of content have been more or less likely to be removed? If not,
why not? If so, what are the results? Have you found that conservative
content is more likely to be removed?
b. What is the source of the enforcement errors? Are these
individual people, AI algorithms, or something else?
c. How are you addressing the source of any errors? E.g., training
for individuals, changes to the AI algorithm?
d. How do you notify persons whose content has been deleted of the
deletion and the reasons for it?
e. Do you disconnect friends with deleted content?
f. Do you prevent information from reaching the feed of followers
of persons who have previously had content deleted?
g. How quickly are complaints about improper censoring addressed?
h. How quickly are complaints about threats addressed?
Answer. Suppressing political content or preventing people from
seeing what matters most to them is directly contrary to Facebook's
mission and our business objectives.
We have engaged an outside advisor, former Senator Jon Kyl, to
advise the company on potential bias against conservative voices. We
believe this external feedback will help us improve over time and
ensure we can most effectively serve our diverse community.
We recently published a detailed set of Community Standards--which
reflect our internal reviewer guidelines--to help people understand
where we draw the line on complex and nuanced issues. Publishing these
details will also make it easier for everyone to give us feedback so
that we can improve the guidelines--and the decisions we make--over
time. Our Community Standards, which are designed to encourage
expression and create a safe environment on Facebook, outline what is
and isn't allowed on the platform.
When someone violates our Community Standards, we send them a
notification. We are also introducing the right to appeal our decisions
on individual posts so people can ask for a second opinion when they
think we've made a mistake.
Question 32. How do you as a company deal with a person whose
content was wrongly deleted? Do you simply restore the content? Do you
offer an apology? Do you make any form of recompense, or otherwise make
clear to the user their speech is welcome on the platform?
Answer. We recognize that our policies are only as good as the
strength and accuracy of our enforcement--and our enforcement is not
perfect. We make mistakes because our processes involve people, and
people are not infallible. We are always working to improve.
When we're made aware of incorrect content removals, we review them
with team members so as to prevent similar mistakes in the future. On
April 24, 2018, we announced the launch of appeals for content that was
removed for hate speech. We recognize that we make enforcement errors
on both sides of the equation--what to allow, and what to remove--and
that our mistakes cause a great deal of concern for people, which is
why we need to allow the option to request review of the decision and
provide additional context that will help our team see the fuller
picture as they review the post again. This type of feedback will allow
us to continue improving our systems and processes so we can prevent
similar mistakes in the future.
We also audit the accuracy of reviewer decisions on an ongoing
basis to coach them and follow up on improving where errors are being
made.
We hope that our recent decision to publicize our detailed
Community Standards, reflecting our internal reviewer guidelines, and
the introduction of appeals will aid in this process. By providing more
clarity on what is and isn't allowed on Facebook, we hope that people
will better understand how our policies apply to them. For some
violation types, where people believe we have made a mistake, they can
request review of our decisions, and we are working to extend this
process further by supporting more violation types.
Question 33. During the hearing, you testified that Facebook will
soon, or does, employ 20,000 personnel to work exclusively on content
moderation.
a. How many personnel currently work on content moderation? How
many new personnel must you hire to reach 20,000?
b. Will all new personnel be directly employed by Facebook?
i. If the answer to question b is no, what percentage of new
personnel will be employed directly by Facebook?
ii.What percentage will be employed by a third party?
c. For all new personnel, whether employed directly by Facebook or
by a third party, how many will be American citizens?
i. How many new personnel will be foreign nationals?
ii. For all new personnel who are foreign nationals, what
worker visa programs--including but not limited to the H-1B and
TN visa programs--will Facebook or a third party use? Please
provide a list of every specific worker visa program Facebook
or a third party intends to use for employment purposes.
iii. What steps will Facebook take to ensure that both the
spirt and the letter of the law governing any worker visa
program is complied with, both by Facebook itself and any third
party?
iv. What additional measures will Facebook or any contracted
third party take to ensure that American workers are not
displaced by foreign workers?
v. What additional measures will Facebook or any contracted
third party take to ensure that foreign workers are not paid a
lower wage than their American counterparts?
vi. Will you commit that no American workers will lose their
job as a result of Facebook or a contracted third party
employing a foreign worker?
Answer. Today, we have about 15,000 people working on security and
content review across the company.
Of that 15,000, more than 7,500 people review content around the
world.
Our content review team is global and reviews reports in
over 50 languages.
Reports are reviewed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and the
vast majority of reports are reviewed within 24 hours.
Our goal is always to have the right number of skilled
people with the right language capabilities to ensure incoming
reports are reviewed quickly and efficiently.
We hire people with native language and other specialist
skills according to the needs we see from incoming reports.
The team also includes specialists in areas like child
safety, hate speech and counter-terrorism, software engineers
to develop review systems, quality control managers, policy
specialists, legal specialists, and general reviewers.
To provide 24/7 coverage across dozens of languages and time zones
and ensure that Facebook is a place where both expression and personal
safety are protected and respected, our content review team includes a
combination of employees, contractors, and vendor partners based in
locations around the world.
Facebook endeavors to comply with all applicable immigration laws
in the United States and the other countries where we operate.
Question 34. What regulations would Facebook support?
Answer. Facebook is generally not opposed to regulation but wants
to ensure it is the right regulation. The issues facing the industry
are complex, multi-faceted, and affect an important part of peoples'
lives. As such, Facebook is absolutely committed to working with
regulators, like Congress, to craft the right regulations. Facebook
would be happy to review any proposed legislation and provide comments.
______
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Orrin Hatch to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. I understand that until just recently, Facebook split
its privacy policy across 20 or more separate webpages, making it
virtually impossible for a typical user to understand what information
he or she was agreeing to allow Facebook to share. Why did you have in
place such a convoluted privacy policy? Why not make the policy as
clear, easy to understand, and accessible as possible?
Answer. We've heard loud and clear that it's important to make
privacy information and controls easy for people to find and use. We've
made recent improvements to our privacy settings to centralize people's
choices, and are providing access to people's key privacy choices
through an updated Privacy Shortcuts feature.
With regard to our Data Policy specifically, it has been available
in a single webpage for many years. We recently updated our Data Policy
in response to feedback that, among other things, we should provide
more detailed explanations and improve the design of the policy. Like
its predecessor, this policy is framed around short, easy-to-understand
topics and questions, like ``What kinds of information do we collect''
and ``How can I manage or delete information about me.''
In designing both our newly updated Data Policy and its
predecessor, as well as our Privacy Basics educational center, we were
mindful of guidance from the FTC and many other experts that recommend
so-called ``layered'' privacy policies, which make it easy to find
topics and high-level information but enable people to access more
detailed information if they wish to do so.
Question 2. I've been a bit perplexed by the way Facebook has come
in for such criticism when so many other online platforms use a similar
business model. I don't necessarily want to name names here, but
Facebook is far from the only website that makes money by offering
advertisers the ability to target ads to specific user groups. How does
your business model differ from, say, Google's, or from other social
media sites?
Answer. Like many other free online services, we sell advertising
space to third parties. Doing so enables us to offer our services to
consumers for free. This is part of our mission to give people the
power to build community and bring the world closer together.
Question 3. Is Facebook unique in the way it collects user
information and offers targeted advertising? How do your data practices
differ from those of other websites?
Answer. No. Countless online and offline companies sell and display
advertising to support the costs of their services, and most engage in
a variety of practices (targeting, contextual placement, list
management) to deliver the most relevant and cost-effective advertising
to people and businesses. Ad-based business models have long been a
common way to enable companies to offer free services, even before the
advent of the Internet when media like radio, television, and
newspapers were ad-supported. Online advertising is particularly
important for smaller and more niche publishers, as well as services--
like Facebook--whose mission is to provide access to everyone,
regardless of their location or ability to pay for services.
While we provide similar services to other websites--and to the
third-party providers of online advertising services on which many
websites rely--we are unique in the level of control we offer over how
we use information to deliver ads. For example, we launched an About
Facebook Ads page (www.facebook.com/ads/about) that explains how we use
information to deliver Facebook ads. Every ad on Facebook comes with a
``Why am I seeing this?'' tool that lets people learn why they are
seeing that particular ad, and to control whether they would like to
see similar ads in the future. And we have built a comprehensive Ad
Preferences tool, which enables people to see interests that we use to
decide what ads to show people, and the list of advertisers that are
showing people ads on Facebook because of past interactions with the
advertiser.
Although these features exceed the transparency and control offered
by many other companies, we've heard that we need to continue to invest
in improvements in this area. That's why, among other things, we've
announced plans to build Clear History, a new feature that will enable
users to see the websites and apps that send us information when they
use them, delete this information from their accounts, and turn off our
ability to store it associated with their accounts going forward.
Question 4. Does Facebook ever share user data with advertisers? If
so, in what circumstances does Facebook share such data? Do advertisers
ever learn the names of, or identifying information about, the
individuals who receive their advertisements?
Answer. We provide advertisers with reports about the kinds of
people seeing their ads and how their ads are performing, but we don't
share information that personally identifies people (information such
as name or that by itself can be used to contact or identifies a
person) unless we have permission from people. For example, we provide
statistical demographic information to advertisers (for example, that
an ad was seen by 2,436 women between the ages of 25 and 34 in
Maryland) to help them better understand their audience. We also
confirm which Facebook ads led people to make purchases or take an
action with an advertiser.
Question 5. How would limiting Facebook's ability to offer targeted
advertising change your business model? How would it impact the
services you offer to customers?
Answer. To build a secure product with extensive infrastructure
that connects people across continents and culture, we need to make
sure everyone can afford it. To do this, we sell advertising, and we
could not offer our service for free without selling advertising.
Advertising lets us keep Facebook free, which ensures it remains
affordable for everyone.
Separately, our core service involves personalizing all content,
features, and recommendations that people see on Facebook services. No
two people have the same experience on Facebook or Instagram, and they
come to our services because they expect everything they see to be
relevant to them. If we were not able to personalize or select ads or
other content based on relevance, this would fundamentally change the
service we offer on Facebook--and it would no longer be Facebook.
Question 6. In your written testimony, you discuss new efforts to
verify advertisers who want to run political or issue ads on Facebook.
It strikes me that this effort should apply to more than just political
ads. For example, shouldn't you also put in place checks for
advertisers that use your platform to illegally peddle prescription
drugs? Which advertisers will need to be verified under your new
policies? And how can we be sure that Facebook won't use these new
policies to engage in viewpoint discrimination?
Answer. Last October, we announced that we would require
advertisers running electoral ads to verify their identities and
locations. We also announced that we would require these ads to use a
``paid for by'' label and that we would include them in a searchable
archive. In April, we announced that we would extend these transparency
measures to ``issue ads''--ads about national policy issues. We have
worked with third parties like the Comparative Agendas Project to
define an initial set of issues, and we will refine that list over
time.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Dianne Feinstein to
Mark Zuckerberg
Scraping of Public Profiles
Question 1. Nearly 2.2 billion people who use Facebook \1\ have
likely had their public profiles scraped by malicious actors, including
by use of a search feature that allowed people to use telephone numbers
and e-mail addresses to obtain user information and through the
company's account recovery feature.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Throughout these Questions, references to Facebook refer to
Facebook as well as all other Facebook-owned platforms, products,
applications, and subsidiaries. For example, this includes Instagram
and WhatsApp.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Why didn't Facebook take any action when it learned in 2013 \2\
that malicious actors could use its features to obtain personal
information from users' profile pages?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ See, e.g., Matt Burgess, ``Facebook fixed a massive data
scraping issue it said wasn't a problem,'' Wired UK (Apr. 5, 2018).
b. Facebook has now disabled the search feature, but are there
plans to replace it? If so, what has Facebook done to ensure that
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
personal information cannot be obtained using this new search feature?
c. What changes is Facebook making to the account recovery feature
to reduce the risk that personal information will be accessible to
malicious actors?
d. What steps is Facebook taking to protect its 2.2 billion users
whose information may have been scraped by malicious actors?
e. What information is being provided to users?
Answer. In April, we found out that a feature that lets users look
someone up by their phone number and e-mail may have been misused by
browsers looking up people's profiles in large volumes with phone
numbers they already had. When we found out about the abuse, we shut
this feature down. In the past, we have been aware of scraping as an
industry issue, and have dealt with specific bad actors previously.
Third Parties
Question 2. In 2014, Facebook updated its policies to reduce third
party applications' access to user data. Facebook is now investigating
applications that, as you described had access to ``a large amount of
information,'' before this change.
a. How is Facebook defining ``a large amount of information?''
Answer. Our investigation is ongoing and as part of it we are
taking a close look at applications that had access to friends data
under Graph API v.1.0 before we made technical changes to our platform
to change this access.
b. How is Facebook determining what applications to include in this
investigation?
Answer. We are in the process of investigating every app that had
access to a large amount of information before we changed our Platform
in 2014. The investigation process is in full swing, and it has two
phases. First, we are undertaking a comprehensive review to identify
every app that had access to this amount of Facebook data and to focus
on apps that present reason for deeper investigation. And second, where
we have concerns, we will conduct interviews, make requests for
information (RFI)--which ask a series of detailed questions about the
app and the data it has access to--and perform audits using expert
firms that may include on-site inspections. We have large teams of
internal and external experts working hard to investigate these apps as
quickly as possible. To date thousands of apps have been investigated
and around 200 apps have been suspended--pending a thorough
investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data. Where we
find evidence that these or other apps did misuse data, we will ban
them and let people know.
These apps relate to a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You,
the Cambridge Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality, with many of the
suspended apps being affiliated with the same entity. Many of these
suspensions include apps that appear to be ``test'' apps that were
never released to the public, and therefore would not have acquired
significant user data, although our investigation into these apps is
ongoing.
Additionally, we have suspended an additional 14 apps, which were
installed by around one thousand people. They were all created after
2014, after we made changes to more tightly restrict our platform APIs
to prevent abuse. However, these apps appear to be linked to AIQ, which
was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica. So we have suspended them
while we investigate further. Any app that refuses to take part in or
fails our audit will be banned.
c. When do you estimate this investigation will be complete?
Answer. It's going to take many months to do this full process.
d. Will Facebook make public the results of this investigation? If
not, why not and will you notify Congress and provide the results when
you are done?
Answer. Where we find evidence that these or other apps did misuse
data, we will ban them from the platform and tell people who used or
may have had data shared with the app.
e. How will Facebook notify people whose data was improperly used?
Answer. See Response to Question (d).
f. What is Facebook doing to monitor and investigate whether
developers or others are taking and selling personal information?
Answer. In general, on an ongoing basis, we proactively review all
apps seeking access to more than basic information (and have rejected
more than half of apps seeking such extended permissions). We also do a
variety of manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with our
policies and a positive experience for people. These include steps such
as random checks of existing apps along with the regular and proactive
monitoring of apps. We also respond to external or internal reports and
investigate for potential app violations. When we find evidence of or
receive allegations of violations, we investigate and, where
appropriate, employ a number of measures, including restricting
applications from our platform, preventing developers from building on
our platform in the future, and taking legal action where appropriate.
Question 3. Individuals who use Facebook assume a certain level of
privacy. There may be an understanding that if something posted is
``public'' that it's available broadly. However, the amount of data and
personal information available through your platforms is enormous.
a. What data about individuals, if any, does Facebook make
available to businesses?
Answer. Facebook does not sell people's information to anyone, and
we never will. We also impose strict restrictions on how our partners
can use and disclose the data we provide.
Our Data Policy makes clear the circumstances in which we work with
third parties who help us provide and improve our Products or who use
Facebook Business Tools to grow their businesses, which makes it
possible to operate our companies and provide free services to people
around the world.
When people choose to use third-party apps, websites, or other
services that use, or are integrated with, our Products, they can
receive information about what users post or share. For example, when
users play a game with their Facebook friends or use a Facebook Comment
or Share button on a website, the game developer or website can receive
information about the users' activities in the game or receive a
comment or link that users share from the website on Facebook. Also,
when users download or use such third-party services, they can access
users' public profile on Facebook, and any information that users share
with them. Apps and websites that people use may receive their list of
Facebook friends if they choose to share it with them. But apps and
websites that people use will not be able to receive any other
information about their Facebook friends from users, or information
about any of the users' Instagram followers (although friends and
followers may, of course, choose to share this information themselves).
Information collected by these third-party services is subject to their
own terms and policies.
Devices and operating systems providing native versions of Facebook
and Instagram (i.e., where we have not developed our own first-party
apps) will have access to all information people choose to share with
them, including information that friends share with users, so they can
provide our core functionality to our users.
b. Can businesses access users' e-mails, direct messages, buying
history, or credit card information?
Answer. See Response to Question 3, part a.
c. Your privacy policies indicate Facebook collects the content of
messages through your direct messenger applications and through private
group postings. How is that information used? Is it shared with anyone?
Answer. We use the information we collect for purposes specified in
our Data Policy. These purposes include:
Providing, personalizing and improving our products;
Providing measurement, analytics and other business
services;
Promoting safety, integrity and security;
Communicating with our community;
Conducting research and innovating for social good.
d. Does Facebook have the capacity to monitor how researchers or
businesses use data they get from Facebook?
Answer. We have a variety of controls in place to help ensure
researchers and businesses comply with our policies.
e. What does Facebook do, if anything, to ensure researchers and
others comply with its use agreements?
Answer. If we discover a researcher or business has misused
people's information, we take appropriate action to address the issue.
Such action may include suspending the business from Facebook or even
banning it altogether.
f. What limitations has Facebook placed on the personal information
that application developers can request from Facebook users? How is
this enforced?
Answer. In April 2014, we announced that we would more tightly
restrict our platform APIs to prevent abuse. At that time we made clear
that existing apps would have a year to transition--at which point they
would be forced (1) to migrate to the more restricted API and (2) be
subject to Facebook's new review and approval protocols. A small number
of developers asked for and were granted short-term extensions beyond
the one-year transition period, the longest of which lasted several
months. These extensions ended several years ago. A transition period
of this kind is standard when platforms implement significant changes
to their technology base and was necessary here to avoid disrupting the
experience of millions of people. New apps that launched after April
30, 2014 were required to use our more restrictive platform APIs.
We are further restricting the data that an app can access without
review to a person's name, profile photo, and e-mail address. We review
to ensure that the requested permissions clearly improve the user
experience and that the data obtained is tied to an experience within
the app. We conduct a variety of manual and automated checks of
applications on the platform for Policy compliance, as well as random
sampling. When we find evidence of or receive allegations of
violations, we investigate and, where appropriate, employ a number of
measures, including restricting applications from our platform,
preventing developers from building on our platform in the future, and
taking legal action where appropriate.
g. What limits has Facebook placed on how personal information can
be used by third parties? Has Facebook prohibited uses beyond what is
necessary to run third party applications?
Answer. Developers can access Account Information in accordance
with their privacy policies and other Facebook policies. All other data
may not be transferred outside the Facebook app, except to service
providers, who need that information to provide services to the
Facebook app. With the exception of Account Information, developers may
only maintain user data obtained from Facebook for as long as necessary
for their business purpose. Developers may not use data obtained from
Facebook to make decisions about eligibility, including whether to
approve or reject an application or how much interest to charge on a
loan. Developers must protect the information they receive from
Facebook against unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. For example,
developers may not use data obtained from Facebook to provide tools
that are used for surveillance.
Cambridge Analytica
Question 4. Facebook learned in 2015 that Cambridge Analytica had
obtained Facebook user information without notice or consent.
a. Why didn't Facebook notify users of this breach in 2015?
b. What is Facebook's current policy for notifying users of privacy
breaches?
c. Why didn't Facebook suspend or ban Cambridge Analytica from its
platforms until 2018?
d. Why didn't Facebook audit Cambridge Analytica?
e. What led Facebook to consider the matter ``closed'' without
taking any of these steps?
f. Have there been any reforms to Facebook's internal investigative
policies based on this experience? (If so, please describe these
changes.)
g. Why didn't Facebook notify the Federal Trade Commission of this
incident before press stories broke in March 2018?
h. What will Facebook do to protect the 87 million people whose
personal information remains in the hands of third parties? \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ See, e.g., Matthew Rosenberg et al., ``How Trump Consultants
Exploited the Facebook Data of Millions,'' N.Y. Times (Mar. 17, 2018)
(the New York Times viewed raw data from the profiles Cambridge
Analytica obtained; copies of the data remain on Cambridge Analytica
servers); Channel 4, ``Revealed: Cambridge Analytica data on thousands
of Facebook users still not deleted,'' (Mar. 28, 2018) (Channel 4 News
saw data on thousands of people in Colorado).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. When Facebook learned in December 2015 of allegations that
Kogan may have violated Facebook's policies, we took immediate action.
Facebook immediately banned Kogan's app from our developer platform and
retained an outside firm to investigate what happened and what further
action we should take to enforce our Platform Policies and protect
people. This culminated in certifications from Kogan, and from
Cambridge Analytica and others whom he certified he had shared some
data with, certifying that they had deleted all data and any
derivatives of the data. Because Kogan's app could no longer obtain
access to most user data (or any friends data) in December 2015 due to
changes in Facebook's platform, the most responsible step to protect
users at the time was to work with Kogan, Cambridge Analytica, and
others to obtain deletion of the data.
Although our developer terms gave us the ability to audit Kogan's
app, we did not have an agreement in place that would have allowed us
to audit third parties that he may have shared data with. For this
reason, we chose to require him to obtain certifications of deletion
from each of these parties, leveraging our rights as to Kogan, who was
the developer of the app.
In March 2018, Facebook received information from the media that
possible questions existed around the validity of deletion
certifications that Facebook received. In response, Facebook
immediately banned Cambridge Analytica and other potentially related
parties from distributing advertising on Facebook or from using other
aspects of our service. At that time, we requested an on-site audit of
Cambridge Analytica, which it agreed to. The forensic auditor's work is
currently on hold at the request of U.K. regulatory authorities, who
themselves are investigating Cambridge Analytica, which is located in
the U.K., and we are actively cooperating with the U.K. authorities to
progress this analysis.
It is important to clarify that Kogan's improper disclosure of
Facebook data that users shared with him does not involve a data breach
on Facebook's platform. There was no unauthorized access to Facebook
data by Kogan, and instead, his app could only access Facebook data
that users specifically consented to share with him. Even though
Kogan's improper disclosure of data was not a breach of our systems,
these actions violate our Platform policy--and we took extensive
measures to try to mitigate any potential misuse of that data by
downstream parties by pushing aggressively for deletion. And we are
implementing an approach that goes beyond legal requirements and
informs people any time we learn than an app developer shared data with
a third-party in violation of our policies. This is consistent with the
responsibility we believe we have with our users, even if the law does
not require this.
Question 5. Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie
told the U.K.'s House of Commons that senior employees at another data
analytics firm were also working on the Facebook data obtained through
Aleksandr Kogan's application.
a. Did anyone besides Prof. Kogan and Cambridge Analytica have
access to the data obtained by Prof. Kogan?
b. Does any company have that data today?
c. What steps are you taking to find out who had access to the data
and how it was used?
d. Is this data still being used? How can its ongoing use be
prevented?
Answer. On December 11, 2015, The Guardian published an article
reporting that Kogan and his company, GSR, may have passed information
the app had obtained from Facebook users to SCL Elections Ltd. (SCL)/
Cambridge Analytica. If this occurred, Kogan and his company violated
Facebook's Platform Policies, which explicitly prohibited selling user
data accessed from Facebook and from sharing any user data accessed
from Facebook with any ad network, data broker or other advertising or
monetization related service.
For this reason, Facebook immediately banned the app from our
platform and investigated what happened and what further action we
should take to enforce our Platform Policies. Facebook also contacted
Kogan/GSR and demanded that they explain what data they collected, how
they used it, and to whom they disclosed it. Facebook further insisted
that Kogan and GSR, as well as other persons or entities to whom they
had disclosed any such data, account for and irretrievably delete all
such data and information.
Facebook also contacted Cambridge Analytica to investigate the
allegations reflected in the reporting. On January 18, 2016, Cambridge
Analytica provided written confirmation to Facebook that it had deleted
the data received from Kogan and that its server did not have any
backups of that data. On June 11, 2016, Kogan executed and provided to
Facebook signed certifications of deletion on behalf of himself and
GSR. The certifications also purported to identify all of the
individuals and entities that had received data from GSR (in addition
to Kogan and his lab), listing the following: SCL, Eunoia Technologies
(a company founded by Christopher Wylie), and a researcher at the
Toronto Laboratory for Social Neuroscience at the University of
Toronto. On July 7, 2016, a representative of the University of Toronto
certified that it deleted any user data or user-derived data. On August
16, 2016, Eunoia (executed by Eunoia Founder Christopher Wylie)
certified that it deleted any user and user-derived data. On September
6, 2016, counsel for SCL informed counsel for Facebook that SCL had
permanently deleted all Facebook data and derivative data received from
GSR and that this data had not been transferred or sold to any other
entity. On April 3, 2017, Alexander Nix, on behalf of SCL, certified to
Facebook, that it deleted the information that it received from GSR or
Kogan.
Because all of these concerns relate to activity that took place
off of Facebook and its systems, we have no way to confirm whether
Cambridge Analytica may have Facebook data without conducting a
forensic audit of its systems. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to submit
to a forensic audit, but we have not commenced that yet due to a
request from the UK Information Commissioner's Office, which is
simultaneously investigating Cambridge Analytica (which is based in the
UK). And even with an audit, it may not be possible to determine
conclusively what data was shared with Cambridge Analytica or whether
it retained data after the date it certified that data had been
deleted.
The existing evidence that we are able to access supports the
conclusion that Kogan only provided SCL with data on Facebook users
from the United States. While the accounts of Kogan and SCL conflict in
some minor respects not relevant to this question, both have
consistently maintained that Kogan never provided SCL with any data for
Facebook users outside the United States. These consistent statements
are supported by a publicly released contract between Kogan's company
and SCL.
Question 6. Cambridge Analytica's managing director was recorded
explaining that the company pushes propaganda ``into the bloodstream of
the internet, and then watch[es] it grow, give[s] it a little push
every now and again . . . like a remote control.'' \4\

slogans the same year Russia launched its influence operation targeting
the 2016 election,'' Business Insider (Mar. 20, 2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Has Facebook investigated what material Cambridge Analytica put
on Facebook's platforms, how the material spread, and how Cambridge
Analytica targeted people?
b. If yes, please provide your findings to the Committee.
c. If not, will Facebook conduct this investigation or allow
researchers to do this, and to provide the findings to the Committee?
Answer. Our investigation of Cambridge Analytica's advertising
activities is ongoing, and we have banned Cambridge Analytica from
purchasing ads on our platform. Cambridge Analytica generally utilized
custom audiences, some of which were created from contact lists and
other identifiers that it generated and uploaded to our system to
identify the people it wanted to deliver ads to on Facebook, and in
some instances, refined those audiences with additional targeting
attributes.
Question 7. Cambridge Analytica and the Kremlin-backed Internet
Research Agency both improperly targeted Facebook users to influence
the 2016 election.
a. Has Facebook compared Cambridge Analytica's targeting of
Facebook users in the United States during the 2016 presidential
election cycle to targeting by the Internet Research Agency?
b. If yes, please describe how Cambridge Analytica's targeting was
both similar to and different from the Internet Research Agency's
targeting.
c. If not, will Facebook do this, and provide its findings to the
Committee?
Answer. The targeting for the IRA ads that we have identified and
provided to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence was relatively rudimentary, targeting very
broad locations and interests, and for example, only used custom
audiences in a very small percentage of its overall targeting and did
not use Contact List Custom Audiences. In addition, all of the custom
audiences used by the IRA were created based on user engagement with
certain IRA pages. By contrast, Cambridge Analytica used hundreds of
Contact List Custom Audiences during the 2016 election cycle created
from contact lists that Cambridge Analytica uploaded to our system, and
Cambridge Analytica used those and other custom audiences in the
majority of its ads targeting in combination with demographic targeting
tools.
Foreign Actors
Question 8. A new study found that more than half of the sponsors
of Facebook ads that featured divisive political messages during the
2016 election were from ``suspicious'' groups, and that one in six
suspicious advertisers was linked to the Internet Research Agency.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Young Mie Kim et al., ``The Stealth Media? Groups and Targets
behind Divisive Issue Campaigns on Facebook,'' Politcal Communication
(forthcoming), available at https://journalism.wisc.edu/wp-content/
blogs.dir/41/files/2018/04/Kim.FB_.StealthMedia.Final_.PolCom
.0411181.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Will you work with these researchers to determine whether any of
the ``suspicious groups'' they identified, other than those associated
with the Internet Research Agency, are also linked to Russia or other
foreign government actors?
b. If so, please also provide the findings to this Committee.
c. If not, will you perform your own analysis of who bought
divisive issue ads leading up to the 2016 election, including how many
were attributable to the Internet Research Agency or other Russian-
backed accounts, and provide your findings to the Committee?
Answer. Facebook has conducted a broad search for evidence that
Russian actors, not limited to the IRA or any other specific entity or
organization, attempted to interfere in the 2016 election by using
Facebook's advertising tools. We found coordinated activity that we now
attribute to the IRA, despite efforts by these accounts to mask the
provenance of their activity. We have used the best tools and
analytical techniques that are available to us to identify the full
extent of this malicious activity, and we continue to monitor our
platform for abuse and to share and receive information from others in
our industry about these threats.
We will continue to work with the government, and across the tech
industry and civil society, to address this important national security
matter so that we can do our part to prevent similar abuse from
happening again. That's why we have provided all of the ads and
associated information to the committees with longstanding, bipartisan
investigations into Russian interference, and we defer to the
committees to share as appropriate. We believe that Congress and law
enforcement are best positioned to assess the nature and intent of
these activities.
Question 9. What is Facebook doing to limit foreign actors' ability
to obtain and use personal information about American users?
Answer. Protecting a global community of more than 2 billion
involves a wide range of teams and functions, and our expectation is
that those teams will grow across the board. For example, we have
dedicated information security and related engineering teams.
Protecting the security of information on Facebook is at the core
of how we operate. Security is built into every Facebook product, and
we have dedicated teams focused on each aspect of data security. From
encryption protocols for data privacy to machine learning for threat
detection, Facebook's network is protected by a combination of advanced
automated systems and teams with expertise across a wide range of
security fields. Our security protections are regularly evaluated and
tested by our own internal security experts and independent third
parties. For the past seven years, we have also run an open bug bounty
program that encourages researchers from around the world to find and
responsibly submit security issues to us so that we can fix them
quickly and better protect the people who use our service.
We anticipate continuing to grow these teams by hiring a range of
experts, including people with specific types of threat intelligence
expertise.
This will never be a solved problem because we're up against
determined, creative and well-funded adversaries. But we are making
steady progress. Here is a list of the 10 most important changes we
have made:
1. Ads transparency. Advertising should be transparent: users
should be able to see all the ads an advertiser is currently
running on Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger. And for ads with
political content, we've created an archive that will hold ads
with political content for seven years--including information
about ad impressions and spend, as well as demographic data
such as age, gender and location. People in Canada and Ireland
can already see all the ads that a Page is running on
Facebook--and we're launching this globally in June.
2. Verification and labeling. Every advertiser will now need
confirm their ID and location before being able to run any ads
with political content in the U.S. All ads with political
content will also clearly state who paid for them.
3. Updating targeting. We want ads on Facebook to be safe and
civil. We thoroughly review the targeting criteria advertisers
can use to ensure they are consistent with our principles. As a
result, we removed nearly one-third of the targeting segments
used by the IRA. We continue to allow some criteria that people
may find controversial. But we do see businesses marketing
things like historical books, documentaries or television shows
using them in legitimate ways.
4. Better technology. Over the past year, we've gotten
increasingly better at finding and disabling fake accounts. We
now block millions of fake accounts each day as people try to
create them--and before they've done any harm. This is thanks
to improvements in machine learning and artificial
intelligence, which can proactively identify suspicious
behavior at a scale that was not possible before--without
needing to look at the content itself.
5. Action to tackle fake news. We are working hard to stop the
spread of false news. We work with third party fact checking
organizations to limit the spread of articles with rated false.
To reduce the spread of false news, we remove fake accounts and
disrupt economic incentives for traffickers of misinformation.
We also use various signals, including feedback from our
community, to identify potential false news. In countries where
we have partnerships with independent third-party fact-
checkers, stories rated as false by those fact-checkers are
shown lower in News Feed. If Pages or domains repeatedly create
or share misinformation, we significantly reduce their
distribution and remove their advertising rights. We also want
to empower people to decide for themselves what to read, trust,
and share. We promote news literacy and work to inform people
with more context. For example, if third-party fact-checkers
write articles about a news story, we show them immediately
below the story in the Related Articles unit. We also notify
people and Page Admins if they try to share a story, or have
shared one in the past, that's been determined to be false. In
addition to our own efforts, we're learning from academics,
scaling our partnerships with third-party fact-checkers and
talking to other organizations about how we can work together.
6. Significant investments in security. We're doubling the
number of people working on safety and security from 10,000
last year to over 20,000 this year. We expect these investments
to impact our profitability. But the safety of people using
Facebook needs to come before profit.
7. Industry collaboration. Recently, we joined 34 global tech
and security companies in signing a TechAccord pact to help
improve security for everyone.
8. Information sharing and reporting channels. In the 2017
German elections, we worked closely with the authorities there,
including the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).
This gave them a dedicated reporting channel for security
issues related to the Federal elections.
9. Tracking 40+ elections. In recent months, we've started to
deploy new tools and teams to proactively identify threats in
the run-up to specific elections. We first tested this effort
during the Alabama Senate election, and plan to continue these
efforts for elections around the globe, including the U.S.
midterms. Last year we used public service announcements to
help inform people about fake news in 21 separate countries,
including in advance of French, Kenyan and German elections.
10. Action against the Russia-based IRA. In April, we removed
70 Facebook and 65 Instagram accounts--as well as 138 Facebook
Pages--controlled by the IRA primarily targeted either at
people living in Russia or Russian-speakers around the world
including from neighboring countries like Azerbaijan,
Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. The IRA has repeatedly used complex
networks of inauthentic accounts to deceive and manipulate
people in the U.S., Europe, and Russia--and we don't want them
on Facebook anywhere in the world.
We are taking steps to enhance trust in the authenticity of
activity on our platform, including increasing ads transparency,
implementing a more robust ads review process, imposing tighter content
restrictions, and exploring how to add additional authenticity
safeguards.
Question 10. Russian accounts continue to use social media to try
to influence American opinion. For example, Fox News started a social
media campaign to demand the declassification and release of the Nunes
memo, which attacked the FBI's Russia investigation. Within hours,
Russian bots were promoting the release of the memo.
a. When this began did Facebook investigate whether Russians were
using its platforms to promote the ``Release the Memo'' campaign?
b. Has Facebook analyzed whether any of the accounts that users
shared WikiLeaks' offer of $1 million for a copy of the Nunes memo
(before it was declassified and released) had connections to Russian-
backed accounts?
Answer. As of our February 7, 2018 letter to you on this issue, our
internal Information Security team has not become aware of information
or activity of a sort that would prompt further review. In addition to
reaching out to law enforcement and our industry partners to understand
whether they have any relevant information regarding this issue and
Russian influence more generally, our Information Security team
regularly conducts internal reviews to monitor for state-sponsored
threats. While we do not publicly disclose the elements of these
reviews for security reasons, factors include monitoring and assessing
thousands of detailed account attributes, such as location information
and connections to others on our platform. We are committed to keeping
law enforcement apprised of our efforts and to working together to
address this threat.
Question 11. How many communications has Facebook had with
individuals associated with any accounts that Facebook has identified
as Internet Research Agency accounts?
Answer. Last fall, we concluded that sharing the ads we've
discovered with Congress, in a manner that is consistent with our
obligations to protect user information, will help government
authorities complete the vitally important work of assessing what
happened in the 2016 election. That is an assessment that can be made
only by investigators with access to classified intelligence and
information from all relevant companies and industries--and we want to
do our part. Congress is best placed to use the information we and
others provide to inform the public comprehensively and completely. Our
practice is to provide messages in response to valid legal process. The
ads (along with the targeting information) are publicly available at
https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/facebook-ads/social-media-
advertisements
.htm.
Question 12. On October 27, 2017, I asked you to provide to the
Committee all communications between Facebook and individuals or
entities associated with Russia-connected users that posted ads or
organic content targeted to any part of the United States for the time
period from January 2, 2015 to the date of production. You have not yet
provided a substantive response to this request. Please provide these
communications.
Answer. See Response to Question 11.
Question 13. Please provide all organic Instagram posts for
Internet Research Agency accounts that targeted users in the United
States.
Answer. Facebook provided all of these posts to the Senate
Judiciary Committee last fall on October 30 and 31.
Global Privacy Protections
Question 14. You have said that Facebook would apply the European
Union's new privacy requirements globally in spirit.
a. Will the privacy requirements be incorporated into the terms of
service that apply to users in the United States? If not, why not? If
so, when will this change be made?
b. It was recently reported that Facebook users outside of the
United States and Canada had previously been governed by terms of
service agreed with Facebook in Ireland.\6\ Facebook is apparently
changing this so that non-European Union users will have their terms of
service agreed with Facebook in the United States. This affects 1.5
billion users. Does this mean that the European Union's new privacy
requirements will not apply to these 1.5 billion users? If Facebook
intends to provide the same privacy protections and controls to users
globally, why did it make this change?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ Alex Hern, ``Facebook moves 1.5bn users out of reach of new
European privacy law,'' The Guardian (Apr. 19, 2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. The change referred to in this question involves the legal
entity with which Facebook users contract when they use the service,
which changed in some jurisdictions as a part of the most recent
updates to our Terms of Service and Data Policy. This change did not
impact people who live in the United States, who contract with
Facebook, Inc. under both our new and old policies.
The substantive protections in our user agreements offered by
Facebook Ireland and Facebook, Inc. are the same. However, there are
certain aspects of our Facebook Ireland Data Policy that are specific
to legal requirements in the GDPR--such as the requirement that we
provide contact information for our EU Data Protection Officer (DPO) or
that we identify the ``legal bases'' we use for processing data under
the GDPR. Likewise, our Facebook Ireland terms and Data Policy address
the lawful basis for transferring data outside the EU, based on legal
instruments that are applicable only to the EU.
In any case, the controls and settings that Facebook is enabling as
part of GDPR are available to people around the world, including
settings for controlling our use of face recognition on Facebook and
for controlling our ability to use data we collect off Facebook Company
Products to target ads. We recently began providing direct notice of
these controls and our updated terms to people around the world
(including in the U.S.), allowing people to choose whether or not to
enable or disable these settings or to consent to our updated terms. We
provide the same tools for access, rectification, erasure, data
portability, and others to people in the U.S. and rest of world that we
provide in Europe, and many of those tools (like our Download Your
Information tool, ad preferences tool, and Activity Log) have been
available globally for many years.
We are also looking to be more responsive to regional norms and
legal frameworks going forward, and want to have the flexibility to
work with local regulators, which is possible with this new model. At
the same time, we are changing the provisions in our Facebook, Inc.
terms in our user agreements outside the United States to allow people
in other countries to file lawsuits against Facebook in their home
country, rather than in courts in the U.S. This transition was part of
a continued effort to be locally responsive in countries where people
use our services.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Patrick Leahy to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. At the April 10, 2018 hearing, regarding Facebook's
role in facilitating dangerous hate speech against Rohingya refugees
from Myanmar, I asked: ``How can you dedicate, and will you dedicate,
resources to make sure such hate speech is taken down within 24
hours?''
You replied, ``Yes. We're working on this.'' \7\ I appreciate your
commitment, in the context of Myanmar, to dedicate resources to take
down hate speech within 24 hours. As you know, hours can save lives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ Transcript of April 10, 2018 hearing, at https://
www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/
wp/2018/04/10/transcript-of-mark-zuckerbergs-senate-hearing/
?utm_term=.5789208de46b.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. When will Facebook be able to fully implement your commitment to
a 24-hour review time for Myanmar?
i. Will Facebook commit to providing relevant data so that
outside researchers can evaluate Facebook's performance metrics
on this matter?
b. Will you extend this same commitment to dedicating the resources
necessary to achieve a 24-hour review time for hate speech in all other
regions of the world in which Facebook is active?
Answer. Reports are reviewed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and the
vast majority of reports are reviewed within 24 hours. Where there are
credible threats of violence we aim to respond much faster, and have
significantly reduced our response time in Myanmar.
To support these efforts, we are investing in people, technology,
and programs.
Over the last two years, we have added dozens more Burmese language
reviewers to handle reports from users across our services, and we plan
to more than double the number of content reviewers focused on user
reports. We also have increased the number of people across the company
working on Myanmar-related issues and we have a special product team
working to better understand the local challenges and build the right
tools to help keep people in the country safe. We will continue to hire
more staff dedicated to Myanmar, including Burmese speakers and policy
experts.
From a programmatic perspective, we will continue to work with
experts to develop safety resources and counter-speech campaigns in
these regions and conduct regular training for civil society and
community groups on using our tools.
Question 2. At the hearing, I showed you an example of a Facebook
post targeting a Muslim journalist in Myanmar. Although comments to the
incendiary post called for the death of this journalist, upon an
initial review the post was deemed not to breach Facebook's Community
Standards.
a. Why was this post deemed not to breach Facebook's Community
Standards?
b. Please describe what processes and systems you have in place to
proactively identify content that breaches Facebook's Community
Standards.
c. What emergency processes do you have in place for situations
where there is content inciting people to violence, and that content
has been reported by users and deemed not to breach your Community
Standards?
d. Please describe any additional processes that you intend to put
in place to address this problem in the future.
We are unable to respond without further information on these
Pages.
However, we can say that our Community Standards strictly prohibit
credible threats of violence. We assess credibility based upon the
information available to us and generally consider statements credible
if the following are present:
A target (person, group of people, or place) and:
Bounty/demand for payment, or
Mention or image of specific weapon, or o Sales offer
or ask to purchase weapon, or o Spelled-out address or
named building, or
A target and two or more of the following details (can be
two of the same detail):
Location
Timing
Method
In evaluating content, context is extremely important. A post
itself may be benign, but the comments associated with the post may
amount to credible threats of violence. That's why people can report
posts, Pages, and Groups to us, as well as individual comments.
The other way we can identify and remove violating content from
Facebook is by proactively finding it using technology. Advances in
technology, including in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
computer vision, mean that we can now:
Remove bad content faster because we don't always have to
wait for it to be reported.
Get to more content because we don't have to wait for
someone else to find it.
Increase the capacity of our review team, which includes
more than 7,500 people around the world, to work on cases where
human expertise is needed to understand the context or nuance
of a particular situation.
Question 3. At the hearing, you stated that Facebook is hiring
``dozens more'' Burmese language content reviewers. There appear to be
only three Burmese content reviewer vacancies currently listed on the
Facebook careers page, all in Facebook's Dublin office.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ See https://www.facebook.com/careers/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. How many Myanmar (Burmese) content reviewers does Facebook
currently have, and how many does Facebook expect to have on staff by
the end of 2018? Please use Full Time Equivalent (FTE) numbers.
b. How does Facebook staff its Burmese language content reviewers
to ensure the capacity to promptly review content outside of normal
Dublin working hours, including during daytime and on weekends in the
Myanmar time zone? How many Burmese language content reviewers do you
have based in Southeast Asia?
c. Facebook reportedly has approximately 1,200 German language
content reviewers, in part to help ensure that hate speech is removed
within 24 hours. How are ``dozens'' of Burmese content reviewers going
to be sufficient to remove all Burmese language hate speech within 24
hours?
Answer. To provide 24/7 coverage across dozens of languages and
time zones and ensure that Facebook is a place where both expression
and personal safety are protected and respected, our content review
teams are made up of a combination of full-time employees, contractors,
and vendor partners based in locations around the world.
Our content review team has included Burmese language reviewers
since 2013, and we have increased this number over time as we continue
to grow and invest in Myanmar. Our goal is always to have the right
number of people with the native language capabilities to ensure
incoming reports are reviewed quickly and effectively.
Reports are reviewed 24 hours a day, 7 days a week and the vast
majority of reports are reviewed within 24 hours. Where there are
credible threats of violence we aim to respond much faster, and have
significantly reduced our response time in Myanmar.
That said, there is more to tackling this problem than reported
content. A lot of abuse may go unreported, which is why we are
exploring the use of artificial intelligence to proactively identify
this content so that we can find it and review it faster.
Question 4. Facebook has long stated its desire to re-enter the
market in China.\9\ As we have seen with other technology platforms,
however, there is a cost to doing business in China, including
potentially enabling the Chinese government's sophisticated censorship
and surveillance regimes. I expressed these concerns to Apple in a
letter with Senator Cruz last year.\10\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ See, e.g., Answers to Questions for the Record by Colin
Stretch, submitted to the Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism, Oct. 31,

\10\ See https://www.cruz.senate.gov/files/documents/Letters/
20171017_tim_cook_letter.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. In order to operate in China, Internet companies must generally
comply with Chinese laws and regulations on censorship.\11\ This
includes a requirement to remove content relating to a list of vaguely-
defined prohibited topics such as ``disrupting social order and
stability'' or ``damaging state honor and interests.'' \12\ Given the
vagueness surrounding which precise words and terms are prohibited in
China, how would Facebook decide what specific content to censor in
China? And if a China-based user travels outside of China, will those
censorship controls still apply to that user's account?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ ``China Has Launched Another Crackdown on the Internet--but
it's Different This Time'', CNBC, Oct. 26, 2017, at https://

\12\ See https://citizenlab.ca/2016/11/wechat-china-censorship-one-
app-two-systems/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. Because Facebook has been blocked in China since 2009, we
are not in a position to know exactly how the government would seek to
apply its laws and regulations on content were we permitted to offer
our service to Chinese users. Since 2013, Facebook has been a member of
the Global Network Initiative (GNI), a multi-stakeholder digital rights
initiative. As part of our membership, Facebook has committed to the
freedom of expression and privacy standards set out in the GNI
Principles--which are in turn based on the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights and the United Nations Guiding Principles on Business and
Human Rights--and we are independently assessed on our compliance with
these standards on a biennial basis.
b. According to The New York Times, Facebook developed ``software
to suppress posts from appearing in people's news feeds in specific
geographic areas,'' in order to ``help Facebook get into China.'' \13\
If true, then what procedures did such software assume would be used to
identify specific content to censor, given the vagueness surrounding
prohibited topics under Chinese law?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\13\ ``Facebook Said to Create Censorship Tool to Get Back Into
China,'' THE NEW YORK TIMES, Nov. 22, 2016, at https://www.nytimes.com/
2016/11/22/technology/facebook-censorship-tool-china.html.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. See Response to Question 4a.
c. Under domestic Chinese law, peaceful acts of free expression may
be considered illegal. For example, the Chinese government has
described the late Nobel Peace laureate Liu Xiaobo as ``a criminal who
has been sentenced by Chinese judicial departments for violating
Chinese law.'' \14\ The case of Tashi Wangchuk indicates that simply
promoting the Tibetan language can be deemed illegally ``inciting
separatism.'' \15\ If Facebook re-enters the Chinese market, what would
it do if Chinese authorities serve it with a legal demand, properly
issued under domestic Chinese law, asking Facebook to turn over the
account information of a peaceful political or religious dissident in
China?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. When something on Facebook or Instagram is reported to us
as violating local law, but doesn't go against our Community Standards,
we may restrict the content's availability only in the country where it
is alleged to be illegal after careful legal review. We receive reports
from governments and courts, as well from non-government entities such
as members of the Facebook community and NGOs. Because Facebook has
been blocked in China since 2009, we are not in a position to know
exactly how the government would seek to apply its laws and regulations
were we permitted to offer our service to Chinese users. Wherever we
operate our service, Facebook is committed to meeting human rights'
standards and to providing transparency around any government requests
for data. This information is available here: https://
transparency.facebook.com/content-restrictions. Our Transparency Report
contains data on restrictions we place on content that does not violate
community standards but that is alleged to violate local law. We do not
have any such reports for the United States.
Question 5. On April 9, 2018, a group of Vietnamese activists and
journalists wrote to you to ask whether Facebook was ``coordinating
with a government known for cracking down on expression.'' \16\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. What safeguards does Facebook have in place to ensure that
account suspension and content takedown are not abused by governments--
including in conjunction with state-sponsored ``trolls''--to silence
legitimate criticism?
Answer. As a GNI member, Facebook is committed to privacy and free
expression principles and implementation guidelines regarding
government requests. The GNI standards have been shaped by
international human rights laws and norms and developed through a
robust multi-stakeholder and consultative process.
b. What more can and will Facebook do in this regard, including but
not limited to providing more transparency and more accessible appeal
mechanisms on takedown decisions?
Answer. On April 24, 2018, we published the internal guidelines we
use to enforce our Community Standards. We decided to publish these
internal guidelines for two reasons. First, the guidelines will help
people understand where we draw the line on nuanced issues. Second,
providing these details makes it easier for everyone, including experts
in different fields, to give us feedback so that we can improve the
guidelines--and the decisions we make--over time.
We know we need to do more. That's why, over the coming year, we
are going to build out the ability for people to appeal our decisions.
As a first step, we are launching appeals for posts that were removed
for nudity/sexual activity, hate speech or graphic violence.
Here's how it works:
If a user's photo, video, or post has been removed because
we found that it violates our Community Standards, they will be
notified, and given the option to request additional review.
This will lead to a review by our team (always by a person),
typically within 24 hours.
If we've made a mistake, we will notify the user and their
post, photo or video will be restored.
We are working to extend this process further, by supporting review
of more violation types, giving people the opportunity to provide more
context that could help us make the right decision, and making appeals
available not just for content that was taken down, but also for
content that was reported and left up. We believe giving people a voice
in the process is another essential component of building a fair
system.
Question 6. Like so many other companies, Facebook has made
promises before to do better on privacy, including in its consent
decree with the FTC. But the American people want accountability, not
promises. That is why I introduced my Consumer Privacy Protection Act,
which would create standards and require prompt notification when a
breach occurs. It is important to note that we only know about the
Cambridge Analytica breach because of a whistleblower.
a. Facebook did not notify the 87 million users when it learned of
this breach in 2015, but you are doing so now. You have now said that
Facebook's failure to notify 87 million users that their information
had been compromised in the Cambridge Analytica breach was a
``mistake.'' Would you support legislation requiring prompt
notification of data breaches (with appropriate temporary exceptions
for ongoing investigations, law enforcement, and national security)?
b. Why did Facebook not verify that Cambridge Analytica actually
deleted the data--especially in 2016 when it was known they were
working for the Trump campaign?
Answer. Facebook is generally open to the idea of breach
notification requirements, particularly legislation that would
centralize reporting and ensure a consistent approach across the United
States. For example, in Europe, the GDPR requires notification to a
lead supervisory authority, rather than individual member states, in
cases of a data breach. In the United States, however, there is no
centralized notification scheme, and instead, reporting obligations
vary widely across all 50 states. This complexity makes it harder to
respond appropriately and swiftly to protect people in the event of a
data breach. We believe this is an important issue and an area that is
ripe for thoughtful regulation.
When Facebook learned about Kogan's breach of Facebook's data use
policies in December 2015, it took immediate action. The company
retained an outside firm to assist in investigating Kogan's actions, to
demand that Kogan and each party he had shared data with delete the
data and any derivatives of the data, and to obtain certifications that
they had done so. Because Kogan's app could no longer obtain access to
most categories of data due to changes in Facebook's platform, the
company's highest priority at that time was ensuring deletion of the
data that Kogan may have accessed before these changes took place. With
the benefit of hindsight, we wish we had notified people whose
information may have been impacted. Facebook has since notified all
people potentially impacted with a detailed notice at the top of their
News Feed.
Question 7. In a recent interview, Dr. Aleksandr Kogan described an
extensive relationship with Facebook, stating that ``I visited their
campus many times. They had hired my students. I even did a consulting
project with Facebook in November of 2015.'' According to 60 Minutes,
Facebook confirmed that Kogan had done research and consulting with the
company in 2013 and 2015.\17\ Please detail Facebook's relationship
with Dr. Kogan, including any consulting and research he did for the
company. Please describe what, if any, access to user data Dr. Kogan
and his company was provided as part of this consulting agreement.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\17\ See https://www.cbsnews.com/news/aleksandr-kogan-the-link-
between-cambridge-analytica
-and-facebook/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. Facebook was put in touch with Kogan (a researcher at the
University of Cambridge) in late 2012, about a possible collaboration
on research relating to the potential relationship between Facebook
friendship ties and economic trade volumes between countries. Kogan
collaborated with current and former Facebook employees on
approximately ten academic papers. As part of these collaborations,
Kogan could only access fully anonymized, aggregated data. Facebook
frequently partners with leading academic researchers to address topics
pertaining to wellbeing, innovation, and other topics of public
importance, following strict protocols to ensure personal information
is safeguarded.
In October 2015, Facebook retained Kogan on a short-term contract
to consult on a research project related to predicting survey outcomes.
Question 8. In 2010, media reports revealed that that an online
tracking company, RapLeaf, was collecting and reselling data it had
obtained from third-party Facebook apps. Facebook subsequently
reportedly cut off RapLeaf's data access and took steps to limit apps'
sharing of data with the company.\18\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\18\ See, e.g., http://www.adweek.com/digital/facebook-shuts-down-
apps-that-sold-user-data-ba

SB10001424052702304772804575558484075236
968.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
a. Please describe what steps, if any, Facebook took to require
RapLeaf to delete the Facebook user data it had obtained, and the
subsequent steps Facebook took to ensure that the information was in
fact deleted. If Facebook did not act to ensure that RapLeaf deleted
this data, please describe why.
b. Please describe what steps, if any, Facebook took with respect
to any third party apps that had sold or shared Facebook user data with
RapLeaf.
Answer. Facebook disabled all RapLeaf domains and instituted six-
month moratoriums on access to Facebook distribution channels for the
developers who shared data. RapLeaf agreed to delete all Facebook IDs
in its possession, immediately terminate all agreements with Facebook
developers, and no longer conduct any activity on the Facebook
platform, whether directly or indirectly. Facebook updated its terms of
service to explicitly prohibit developers from interacting with any
data brokers.
Question 9. At the hearing, you stated ``every single time they
choose to share something, there [on Facebook]--they have a control
right there about who they want to share it with.'' \19\ If a user sets
these privacy controls to limit their information to a specific
audience (e.g. their ``friends''), should that user expect that no
other parties--including Facebook's advertising algorithms--will be
able to view or use that information? Should this expectation extend to
the trail of information that the user generates by interacting with
the service (e.g., ``likes'' and other reactions, IP logins,
geolocation, and operating system usage)?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\19\ Transcript of April 10, 2018 hearing, at https://
www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/04/10/transcript-of-
mark-zuckerbergs-senate-hearing/?utm_term=.5789208de46b.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Answer. Our goal is to show people information on Facebook that's
relevant and useful to them. To do this, we personalize people's news
feeds and other information, including ads, that we show them based on
the information that they've added to their Facebook accounts, like the
things they like or comment on.
People can control how this works through their News Feed Settings
and Ad Preferences, and they can also choose who can see the
information that they choose to share on Facebook. With regard to
advertisers specifically, though, we do not tell advertisers who people
are or sell their information to anyone. We think relevant advertising
and privacy aren't in conflict, and we're committed to doing both well.
Question 10. Beyond information provided directly in response to
valid legal process in individual criminal matters, does Facebook
provide any information about users to, or cooperate in any way with,
Federal, State, or local agencies or authorities--or companies working
on their behalf--in a way that would allow for user profiling and/or
predictive analytics?
Answer. Facebook is not familiar with government agencies'
practices regarding profiling and/or predictive analytics and therefore
cannot speculate what would ``allow for'' such agencies to use such
techniques. Facebook discloses account records to Federal, State, or
local agencies and authorities only in accordance with our terms of
service and applicable law. Additionally, we prohibit developers from
using data obtained from us to provide tools that are used for
surveillance.
Question 11. One critique of social media in general is that the
most sensational or provocative material often tends to spread the
fastest, due to algorithms that prioritize ``engagement.'' This can
contribute to a deepening polarization of society. What is Facebook
doing with regards to its algorithms, if anything, to address this
problem? And what role to you see for outside auditing, verification,
or checks of these solutions, given the impact on society?
Answer. Facebook is a distribution platform that reflects the
conversations, including polarized ones, already taking place in
society. We are keenly aware of the concern that our platform is
contributing to polarization, and we have been working to understand
the role that we play in discourse and information diversity. The data
on what causes polarization and ``filter bubbles'' is mixed. Some
independent research has shown that social media platforms provide more
information diversity than traditional media, and our own research
indicates that most people on Facebook have at least some friends who
claim an opposing political ideology--probably because Facebook helps
people to maintain ties with people who are more distantly connected to
them than their core community--and that the content in News Feed
reflects that added diversity.
We want Facebook to be a place where people can discover more news,
information, and perspectives, and we are working to build products
that help to that. Through our News Feed algorithm, we also work hard
to actively reduce the distribution of clickbait, sensationalism, and
misinformation, on the one hand, and to boost news and information from
sources that are trusted, informative, and local, on the other hand.
Question 12. Some people have claimed that what Cambridge Analytica
did was no different than the Obama campaign's data-driven campaign in
2012.
a. Yes or no, did the Obama campaign in 2012 violate any of
Facebook's policies, and thereby get banned from the platform?
Answer. Both the Obama and Romney campaigns had access to the same
tools, and no campaign received any special treatment from Facebook.
b. Yes or no, did Cambridge Analytica violate multiple policies--
including misleading users and Facebook, and improperly exploiting user
data--and thereby get banned from your platform?
Answer. By passing information on to a third party, including SCL/
Cambridge Analytica and Christopher Wylie of Eunoia Technologies, Kogan
violated our platform policies. When we learned of this violation in
2015, we removed his app from Facebook and demanded certifications from
Kogan and all parties he had given data to that the information had
been destroyed. Cambridge Analytica, Kogan, and Wylie all certified to
us that they destroyed the data. In March 2018, we received reports
that, contrary to the certifications we were given, not all data was
deleted. We are moving aggressively to determine the accuracy of these
claims. If true, this is another unacceptable violation of trust and
the commitments they made. We have suspended SCL/Cambridge Analytica,
Wylie, and Kogan from Facebook, pending further information.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Richard Durbin to
Mark Zuckerberg
For questions with subparts, please answer each subpart separately.
Question 1. Mr. Zuckerberg, at your hearing I asked whether it is
fair for users of Facebook to expect to know what information Facebook
is collecting on them, who Facebook is sending the information to, and
whether Facebook asked the user in advance for permission to do that.
You answered ``yes'' and said ``I think everyone should have control
over how their information is used.''
a. In order for users to know what information Facebook is
collecting on them, will Facebook commit to proactively notifying each
Facebook user via e-mail on at least an annual basis that the user can
securely view all information that Facebook has collected on that user
during the previous year and providing the user with instructions for
how to do so?
Answer. Our Download Your Information or ``DYI'' tool is Facebook's
data portability tool and was launched many years ago to let people
access and download many types of information that we maintain about
them. The data in DYI and in our Ads Preferences tool contain each of
the interest categories that are used to show people ads, along with
information about the advertisers are currently running ads based on
their use of an advertiser's website or app. People also can choose not
to see ads from those advertisers. We recently announced expansions to
Download Your Information, which, among other things, will make it
easier for people to see their data, delete it, and easily download and
export it. More information is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/
news/2018/04/new-privacy-protections.
Responding to feedback that we should do more to provide
information about websites and apps that send us information when
people use them, we also announced plans to build Clear History. This
new feature will enable users to see the websites and apps that send us
information when they use them, delete this information from their
account, and turn off Facebook's ability to store it associated with
their account going forward.
We have also introduced Access Your Information. This feature
provides a new way for people to access and manage their information.
Users can go here to delete anything from their timeline or profile
that they no longer want on Facebook. They can also see their ad
interests, as well as information about ads they've clicked on and
advertisers who have provided us with information about them that
influence the ads they see. From here, they can go to their ad settings
to manage how this data is used to show them ads.
b. Will Facebook commit to proactively notifying each Facebook user
via e-mail on at least an annual basis that the user can securely view
a list of all entities to which Facebook has sent any of the user's
information during the previous year and providing the user with
instructions on how to do so?
Answer. Facebook allows people to view, manage, and remove the apps
that they have logged into with Facebook through the App Dashboard. We
recently prompted everyone to review their App Dashboard as a part of a
Privacy Checkup, and we also provided an educational notice on Facebook
to encourage people to review their settings. More information about
how users can manage their app settings is available at https://
www.facebook.com/help/218345114850283?helpref=about_content.
The categories of information that an app can access are clearly
disclosed before the user consents to use an app on the Facebook
Platform. Users can view and edit the categories of information that
apps they have used have access to through the App Dashboard.
Question 2. At your hearing, I pointed out that information is
collected on users by Facebook and ``sometimes, people have made money
off of sharing that information'' without the users' knowledge or
advance consent. You responded by saying you would provide information
about Facebook's developer platform, and I asked if you could provide
that information for the record because of limited time. Please provide
this information for the record.
Answer. In 2007, there was industry-wide interest in enriching and
expanding users' experiences on various platforms by allowing them to
take their data (from a device or service) to third-party developers to
receive new experiences. For example, around that time, Apple and
Google respectively launched their iOS and Android platforms, which
were quickly followed by platform technologies and APIs that allowed
developers to develop applications for those two platforms and
distribute them to users through a variety of channels. Similarly, in
2007, Facebook launched a set of platform technologies that allowed
third parties to build applications that could run on and integrate
with the Facebook service and that could be installed by Facebook users
who chose to do so. In December 2009, Facebook launched new privacy
controls that enabled users to control which of the types of
information that they made available to their friends could be accessed
by apps used by those friends.
As with all of these platforms, the permissions model that governed
the information that third-party applications could access from the
Platform evolved. For example, in April 2010, Facebook launched
granular data permissions (GDP), which allowed users to examine a list
of categories of information that an app sought permission to access
before they authorized the app.
Throughout the relevant period and through today, Facebook's
policies regarding third-party usage of its platform technologies have
prohibited--and continue to prohibit--those third-party app developers
from selling or licensing user data obtained from Facebook or from
sharing any user data obtained from Facebook with any ad network, data
broker or other advertising or monetization-related service.
In November 2013, when Kogan launched the app, apps generally could
be launched on the Platform without affirmative review or approval by
Facebook. The app used the Facebook Login service, which allowed users
to utilize their Facebook credentials to authenticate themselves to
third-party services. Facebook Login and Facebook's Graph API also
allowed the app to request permission from its users to bring their
Facebook data (their own data and data shared with them by their
friends) to the app, to obtain new experiences.
At that time, the Graph API V1 allowed app developers to request
consent to access information from the installing user such as name,
gender, birthdate, location (i.e., current city or hometown), photos
and Page likes--and also (depending on, and in accordance with, each
friend's own privacy settings) the same or similar categories of
information the user's friends had shared with the installing user.
Permitting users to share data made available to them by their friends
had the upside of making the experience of app users more personalized
and social. For example, a Facebook user might want to use a music app
that allowed the user to (1) see what his or her friends were listening
to and (2) give the app permission to access the user's friend list and
thereby know which of the user's friends were also using the app. Such
access to information about an app user's friends required not only the
consent of the app user, but also required that the friends whose data
would be accessed have their own privacy settings set to permit such
access by third-party apps. In other words, Kogan's app could have
accessed a user's friends' information only for friends whose privacy
settings permitted such sharing.
In April 2014, we announced that we would more tightly restrict our
platform APIs to prevent abuse. At that time we made clear that
existing apps would have a year to transition--at which point they
would be forced (1) to migrate to the more restricted API and (2) be
subject to Facebook's new review and approval protocols. A small number
of developers asked for and were granted short-term extensions beyond
the one-year transition period, the longest of which lasted several
months. These extensions ended several years ago. A transition period
of this kind is standard when platforms implement significant changes
to their technology base and was necessary here to avoid disrupting the
experience of millions of people. New apps that launched after April
30, 2014 were required to use our more restrictive platform APIs, which
incorporated several key new elements, including:
Institution of a review and approval process, called App
Review (also called Login Review), for any app seeking to
operate on the new platform that would request access to data
beyond the user's own public profile, e-mail address, and a
list of friends of the user who had installed and authorized
the same app;
Generally preventing new apps on the new platform from
accessing friends data without review; and
Providing users with even more granular controls over their
permissions as to what categories of their data an app
operating on the new platform could access.
Our investigation is ongoing and as part of it we are taking a
close look at applications that had access to friends data under Graph
API v.1.0 before we made technical changes to our platform to change
this access.
The App Review process introduced in 2014 required developers who
create an app that asks for more than certain basic user information to
justify the data they are looking to collect and how they are going to
use it. Facebook then reviewed whether the developer has a legitimate
need for the data in light of how the app functions. Only if approved
following such review can the app ask for a user's permission to get
their data. Facebook has rejected more than half of the apps submitted
for App Review between April 2014 and April 2018, including Kogan's
second app. We are changing Login so that the only data that an app can
request without app review will include name, profile photo, and e-mail
address.
Question 3. At your hearing I asked you about Messenger Kids and
asked ``what guarantees can you give us that no data from Messenger
Kids is or will be collected or shared'' in ways that might violate the
Children's Online Privacy Protection Act. You said ``in general, that
data is not going to be shared with third parties.'' I noted that your
use of the qualifier ``in general'' ``seems to suggest that in some
circumstances it will be shared with third parties'' You responded
``no, it will not.''
a. Please describe any information collected via Messenger Kids
that is shared by Facebook with any third party.
Answer. We have no plans to include advertising in Messenger Kids.
Moreover, there are no in-app purchases, and we do not use the data in
Messenger Kids to advertise to children or their parents. In developing
the app we assembled a committee of advisors, including experts in
child development, online safety, and media and children's health, and
we continue to work with them on an ongoing basis. In addition, we
conducted roundtables with parents from around the country to ensure we
were addressing their concerns and built the controls they need and
want in the app. We are committed to approaching all efforts related to
children 12 and under thoughtfully, and with the guidance and input of
experts and parents.
b. Please confirm for the record that no data collected from
Messenger Kids is, or will be, shared with third parties in violation
of COPPA.
Answer. See Response to Question 3a.
Question 4. At your hearing, I asked ``would you be open to the
idea that someone having reached adult age having grown up with
Messenger Kids be allowed to delete the data you have collected?'' You
said ``Senator, yes . . . I think it is a good idea to consider making
sure that all that information is deleted.''
a. Will you commit to allow children, when they reach adulthood, to
request that any information gathered about them by Facebook while they
were under age 13 be deleted and will you commit that Facebook will
comply with such requests?
b. Do you support giving American Internet users the ability to
request the deletion of any and all information collected as a result
of a user's online activities prior to age 13, and to require companies
to delete such information when an individual has requested it?
c. Do you think children would benefit from the ability to wipe
clean the information that has been gathered and collected on them
through their online activities before age 13?
d. Do children deserve the chance to grow up and learn how to
responsibly use the Internet prior to age 13 without having their
childhood Internet data preserved in perpetuity by for-profit
companies?
Answer. Under our Messenger Kids Privacy Policy, available at
https://www.facebook.com/legal/messengerkids/privacypolicy, Parents can
control their children's accounts. Through the Parent Dashboard in
their Facebook (or Messenger) account, a parent or guardian can review
and edit their child's Messenger Kids profile information, and remove
contacts to prevent further communication with their child on Messenger
Kids. In addition, a parent or guardian who has authorized the
Messenger Kids app can see their child's interactions on Messenger Kids
by accessing their child's account. In order to stop further collection
and use of their child's personal information on Messenger Kids, a
parent or guardian can delete their child's Messenger Kids account. If
a parent deletes their child's account, Facebook deletes their
Messenger Kids registration information, information about their
activity and contacts, and device information, as described above.
However, the messages and content a child sent to and received from
others before their account was deleted may remain visible to those
users.
Question 5. What do you think is the maximum amount of time per day
that a child under age 13 should spend using Internet social media?
Answer. We are committed to working with parents and families, as
well as experts in child development, online safety and children's
health and media, to ensure we are building better products for
families--that means building tools that promote meaningful
interactions and help people manage their time on our platform and it
means giving parents the information, resources and tools they need to
set parameters for their children's use of online technologies and help
them develop healthy and safe online habits. It also means continued
research in this area.
Indeed, Messenger Kids, the only product we offer to children under
the age of 13, includes Sleep Mode, which gives parents the ability to
set parameters on when the app can be used, and the app does not have
ads or in app purchases. In building the app, we worked closely with
leading child development experts, educators, and parents to inform our
decisions and we continue to work with them on an ongoing basis. Our
advisors included experts in the fields of child development, online
safety and children's media currently and formerly from organizations
such as the Yale Center for Emotional Intelligence (http://ei.yale.edu/
who-we-are/mission/), Connect Safely (http://www.connectsafely.org/
about-us/), Center on Media and Child Health (http://cmch.tv/), Sesame
Workshop (http://www.huffingtonpost.com/author/dr-lewis-bernstein) and
more.
We also have a Parents Portal (https://www.facebook.com/safety/
parents) and Youth Portal (https://www.facebook.com/safety/youth),
which are both focused on fostering conversations around online safety,
security, and well-being and giving parents and young people access to
the information and resources they need to make informed decisions
about their use of online technologies.
Question 6. Does Facebook agree that states have a strong interest
in protecting the privacy of their residents?
Answer. We believe strongly in providing meaningful privacy
protections to people. This is why we work hard to communicate with
people about privacy and build controls that make it easier for people
to control their information on Facebook. For example, Facebook has
redesigned its settings menu to make things easier to find and
introduced new Privacy Shortcuts. These shortcuts allow users to make
their account more secure, control their personal information, control
which ads they see, and control who sees their posts and profile
information. Facebook has also introduced additional tools to find,
download, and delete user data.
We've worked with regulators, legislators, and privacy experts, at
both the state and national levels to educate people and businesses
about privacy. We believe an important component of any privacy
regulation is clear and consistent oversight and enforcement. We intend
to continue this collaborative work to promote privacy protections for
our community.
Question 7. Does Facebook think companies should have to get
Americans' consent before scanning and storing their biometric data?
Answer. Facebook uses facial recognition technology to provide
people with products and features that enhance online experiences for
Facebook users while giving them control over this technology.
Facebook's facial recognition technology helps people tag their friends
in photos; gives people an easier and faster way to privately share
their photos with friends; helps people with visual impairments by
generating descriptions of photos that people using screen readers can
hear as they browse Facebook; lets people know when a photo or video of
them has been uploaded to Facebook, even if they are not tagged; and
helps prevent people from impersonating other Facebook users.
Facial recognition technology uses machine-learning algorithms to
analyze the pixels in photos and videos in which a user is tagged, and
the photo used by the person as his or her profile picture, and
generates a unique number called a template. When a photo or video is
uploaded to Facebook, Facebook uses the template to attempt to identify
someone by determining whether there are any faces in that content, and
analyzing the portion of the image in which the face appears to compare
it against certain Facebook users depending on the purpose for which
facial recognition is being performed.
Facebook has not shared and does not have plans to share or make
available to any third party its facial recognition templates.
Moreover, these templates do not provide meaningful information on
their own; they can be used to identify a person only in conjunction
with Facebook's software. They could not be reverse-engineered to
recreate someone's face.
Facebook designed its facial-recognition technology and the
applications that use it with privacy considerations in mind and
incorporated various safeguards and controls that protect both (1)
users' ability to control the collection, use, and disclosure of their
personal information, and (2) the security of that personal
information.
Facebook gives users control over whether Facebook uses facial
recognition to recognize them in photos and videos. That control is
exercised through users' privacy settings. If a user chooses to turn
facial recognition off, Facebook does not create a template for that
person or deletes any template it has previously created. Facebook will
then be unable to recognize that person in any photos or videos that
are uploaded to the service. Facebook also deletes templates of people
who delete their Facebook accounts. Additionally, Facebook does not
maintain templates for users who have no photos tagged of themselves
and do not have a profile photo that is capable of being used to
generate a face signature or template (e.g., where a user has no
profile photo, where a user's profile photo does not contain a human
face, or where a user's profile photo contains multiple untagged
faces).
We inform people about our use of facial-recognition technology
through the Data Policy, Help Center, posts on Facebook, and direct
user notifications. Facebook users are told that they can opt out of
facial recognition at any time--in which case Facebook will delete
their template and will no longer use facial recognition to identify
them.
In creating facial recognition templates, Facebook uses only data
that people have voluntarily provided to Facebook: the photos and
videos that people have voluntarily uploaded to Facebook (including
public profile pictures) and the tags people have applied to those
photos and videos. Facebook does not use facial recognition to identify
someone to a stranger.
Question 8. Has Facebook advocated for any changes to the Illinois
Biometric Information Privacy Act, either on its own or as the member
of a trade association or state chamber of commerce?
Answer. We are aware of several pending measures to amend the
Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act to foster the use of
technology to enhance privacy and data security and combat threats like
fraud, identity theft, and impersonation. Facebook has not supported
these measures or requested any organization or chamber of commerce to
do so.
In 2016, Senator Terry Link, the author of the Illinois Biometric
Information Privacy Act, introduced a measure (HB 6074) clarifying that
the original law (1) does not apply to information derived from
physical or digital photographs and (2) uses the term ``scan'' to mean
information that is obtained from an in-person process. These
clarifying amendments were consistent with industry's longstanding
interpretation of the law and Facebook publicly supported them.
Question 9. Would advocating for changes to the Illinois Biometric
Identification Privacy Act be consistent with Facebook's commitment to
protecting privacy?
Answer. Facebook's advocacy is consistent with our commitment to
protecting privacy. As the findings of the Illinois General Assembly
confirm, when people raise privacy concerns about facial recognition,
they are generally about specific uses of facial recognition. In
enacting the Illinois Biometric Information Privacy Act, the General
Assembly explained that its concern was ``new applications of
biometric-facilitated financial transactions, including finger-scan
technologies at grocery stores, gas stations, and school cafeterias.''
Facebook's use of facial recognition in our products, on the other
hand, is very different. Facebook uses facial-recognition technology
with users to provide Facebook users--who choose to join Facebook for
the purpose of connecting with and sharing information about themselves
with others, and affirmatively agree to Facebook's Terms of Service and
Data Policy--with products and features that protect their identities
and enhance their online experiences while giving them control over the
technology. For example, Facebook uses facial-recognition technology to
protect users against impersonators by notifying users when someone
else has uploaded a photo of them for use as a profile photo and to
enable features on the service to people who are visually impaired.
Facebook also uses facial-recognition technology to suggest that people
who upload photos or videos tag the people who appear in the photos or
videos. When someone is tagged in a photo or video, Facebook
automatically notifies that person that he or she has been tagged,
which in turn enables that person to take action if he or she does not
like the content--such as removing the tag or requesting that the
content be removed entirely. Facebook users have always had the ability
to change their settings to prevent Facebook from using facial
recognition to recognize them.
Given the very different uses of facial-recognition technology that
exist, we believe that a one-size-fits-all approach to regulation of
facial-recognition technology is not in the public's best interest, and
we believe that clarification that the Illinois Biometric Information
Privacy Act was not intended to apply to all uses of facial recognition
is consistent with Facebook's commitment to protecting privacy.
Furthermore, our commitment to support meaningful, thoughtfully drafted
privacy legislation means that we can and do oppose measures that
create confusion, interfere with legitimate law enforcement action,
create unnecessary risk of frivolous litigation, or place undue burdens
on people's ability to do business online.
Question 10. Does Facebook oppose legislative efforts to revise and
carve exceptions out of the Illinois Biometric Identification Privacy
Act?
Answer. See Responses to Questions 8 and 9.
Question 11. Last October, Facebook's general counsel, Colin
Stretch, testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime
and Terrorism. I asked him about a letter that 19 leading civil rights
organizations--including Muslim Advocates, The Leadership Conference on
Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP, the Arab American Institute, Human
Rights Campaign, and the Southern Poverty Law Center--sent to Facebook,
which explained their ``deep concern regarding ads, pages, and hateful
content on your platform used to divide our country, and in particular,
to promote anti-Muslim, anti-Black, anti-immigrant, and anti-LGBTQ
animus.''
The organizations referenced a number of examples that had
previously been reported by the media, including a Russian Facebook
account that ``not only promoted anti-immigrant messaging online, but
also managed to organize an in-person anti-refugee rally in Twin Falls,
Idaho in August 2016.'' The letter also alleges that ``Facebook offered
its expertise to a bigoted advocacy group by creating a case study
testing different video formats, and advising on how to enhance the
reach of the group's anti-refugee campaign in swing states during the
final weeks of the 2016 election.''
Mr. Stretch agreed that the content was vile and responded that
Facebook was ``tightening our content guidelines as they apply to ads
with respect to violence.''
I know that Facebook has met with the groups that have expressed
these concerns, but can you elaborate on the specific, substantive
steps that Facebook has taken so far, and plans to take in the future,
to combat violent hate content on your platform?
Answer. Facebook has engaged Relman, Dane & Colfax, a respected
civil rights law firm, to carry out a comprehensive civil rights
assessment of Facebook's services and internal operations. Laura
Murphy, a national civil liberties and civil rights leader, will help
guide this process--getting feedback directly from civil rights groups,
like The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights--and help
advise Facebook on the best path forward.
On hate speech specifically, our policies prohibit direct attacks
on people based on what we call protected characteristics--race,
ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation,
sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disability or disease. We
also provide some protections for immigration status. We define attack
as violent or dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, or calls
for exclusion or segregation, and we separate attacks into three tiers
of severity.
We recently updated our hate speech policies to remove violent
speech directed at groups of people defined in part by protected
characteristics. Under the previous hate speech policy, a direct attack
targeting women exclusively on the basis of gender, for example, would
have been removed from Facebook, but the same content directed at women
drivers would have remained on the platform. We have come to see that
this distinction is a mistake, and we no longer differentiate between
the two forms of attack when it comes to only the most violent hate
speech. We continue to explore how we can adopt a more granular
approach to hate speech.
In the last nine months, we have also made significant changes to
advertising on Facebook, committing to a more robust ad review process
and the hiring of 10,000 more people to aid in our safety and security
efforts, increasing ads transparency, and tightening restrictions on
advertiser content and targeting.
Strengthening enforcement. Before any ad can appear on
Facebook or Instagram, it must go through our ad review
process. We rely on both automated and manual review, and we're
taking aggressive steps to strengthen both. The process
includes automated checks of an ad's images, text, targeting,
and positioning, in addition to the content on the ad's
Facebook and landing pages. Our automated systems also flag
content for human review. We are increasing the size of our
security and safety teams from 10,000 to 20,000 over the course
of this year, and are simultaneously working to hire more
people from African American and Hispanic communities. This
will help increase the diversity of our workforce and improve
our understanding and awareness of ads that are meant to
exploit culturally sensitive issues. In addition, we are
investing more in machine learning to better understand when to
flag and take down ads.
Making advertising more transparent. We believe that when
users see an ad, they should know who ran it and what other ads
they're running--which is why we show the Page name for any ads
that run in a user's News Feed. To provide even greater
transparency for people and accountability for advertisers,
we're now building new tools that will allow users to see the
other ads a Page is running as well--including ads that aren't
targeted to them directly. We hope that this will establish a
new standard for our industry in ad transparency. We try to
catch content that shouldn't be on Facebook before it's even
posted--but because this is not always possible, we also take
action when people report ads that violate our policies. We
hope that more transparency will mean more people can report
inappropriate ads.
Tightening restrictions on advertiser content. We hold
people on Facebook to our Community Standards, and we hold
advertisers to even stricter guidelines. Our ads policies
already prohibit shocking content, direct threats and the
promotion of the sale or use of weapons. Going forward, we are
expanding these policies to prevent ads that use even more
subtle expressions of violence.
Changes to advertiser targeting. Being able to direct ads at
a particular audience is particularly valuable for businesses
and for people, but it's important that this be done in a safe
and civil way. That's why we've been closely reviewing the
targeting options we offer. Even though targeting is an
important tool to reach people, we have heard concerns about
potential abuse, particularly about the feature that lets
advertisers exclude people from their ads. Advertisers want to
show ads to people most likely to be interested in their
offerings, and exclusion targeting helps avoid showing ads to
people who likely aren't interested. For example, if a local
basketball team is trying to attract new fans, they can exclude
people who are already interested in the team. In response to
the feedback we've received, we've removed thousands of
categories from exclusion targeting. We focused mainly on
topics that relate to potentially sensitive personal
attributes, such as race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and
religion. Our review is continuous; the process will be ongoing
and we'll continue soliciting feedback. We take our
responsibility to keep advertising safe and civil seriously,
and we will keep exploring more ways to make targeting work for
people and businesses.
Question 12. We have also seen the impact of hate content on the
international stage. In Myanmar, United Nations investigators have
found that Facebook has played a ``determining role'' in violence
against the Muslim Rohingya population.
Specifically, the chairman of the U.N. Independent International
Fact-Finding Mission on Myanmar told reporters that social media ``has
. . . substantively contributed to the level of acrimony and dissension
and conflict, if you will, within the public. Hate speech is certainly
of course a part of that. As far as the Myanmar situation is concerned,
social media is Facebook, and Facebook is social media.'' Another
investigator said that Facebook was used by ultra-nationalists who were
``inciting a lot of violence and a lot of hatred against the Rohingya
or other ethnic minorities.''
In a recent interview with Vox, you suggested that Facebook's
systems had detected inflammatory, widely-shared chain letters about
imminent attacks, and that Facebook stopped those messages. In reality,
a group of Myanmar civil society organizations had flagged this
content, and the messages were shared thousands of times for three days
before Facebook took steps to prevent the spread of the messages. After
your interview, these organizations sent you a letter noting ``this
case exemplifies the very opposite of effective moderation: it reveals
an over-reliance on third parties, a lack of a proper mechanism for
emergency escalation, a reticence to engage local stakeholders around
systemic solutions and a lack of transparency.'' I understand that you
have personally responded to these organizations and that they have
sent you a follow-up letter asking for additional information on how
Facebook is addressing these issues.
The situation in Myanmar is not unique. Violent anti-Muslim content
is also widely shared in Sri Lanka and recently led the Sri Lankan
government to temporarily ban access to Facebook. A recent Buzzfeed
report stated:
Government officials, researchers, and local NGOs say they have
pleaded with Facebook representatives from as far back as 2013
to better enforce the company's own rules against using the
platform to call for violence or to target people for their
ethnicity or religious affiliation. They repeatedly raised the
issue with Facebook representatives in private meetings, by
sharing in-depth research, and in public forums. The company,
they say, did next to nothing in response.
Ethnic tensions run deep in Sri Lanka, particularly between the
majority Sinhala Buddhists and minority groups, and the country
has seen a troubling rise in anti-Muslim hate groups and
violence since the end of its decades-long civil war in 2009.
Many of those hate groups spread their messages on Facebook.
The problem came to a head in March when Buddhist mobs in
central Sri Lanka burned down dozens of Muslim shops, homes,
and places of worship.
a. What is your response to these reports?
b. What steps is Facebook taking to address anti-Muslim hate
content in countries like Sri Lanka and Myanmar?
Answer. We've been too slow to deal with the hate and violence in
places like Myanmar and Sri Lanka. The challenges we face in a country
that has fast come online are very different than those in other parts
of the world, and we are investing in people, technology, and programs
to help address them as effectively as possible.
We are increasing the number of Burmese and Sinhalese-language
content reviewers as we continue to grow and invest in Myanmar and Sri
Lanka. Our goal is always to have the right number of people with the
right native language capabilities to ensure incoming reports are
reviewed quickly and effectively. That said, there is more to tackling
this problem than reported content. A lot of abuse may go unreported,
which is why we are supplementing our hiring with investments in
technology and programs.
We are building new tools so that we can more quickly and
effectively detect abusive, hateful, or false content. We have, for
example, designated several hate figures and organizations for
repeatedly violating our hate speech policies, which has led to the
removal of accounts and content that support, praise, or represent
these individuals or organizations. We are also investing in artificial
intelligence that will help us improve our understanding of dangerous
content.
We are further strengthening our civil society partner network so
that we have a better understanding of local context and challenges. We
are focusing on digital literacy education with local partners in
Myanmar and Sri Lanka. For example, we launched a local language
version of our Community Standards to educate new users on how to use
Facebook responsibly in 2015 and we have been promoting these actively
in Myanmar, reaching over 8 million people through promotional posts on
our platform alone. We've also rolled out several education programs
and workshops with local partners to update them on our policies and
tools so that they can use this information in outreach to communities
around the country. One example of our education initiatives is our
work with the team that developed the Panzagar initiative (https://
www.facebook.com/supportflowerspeech) to develop the Panzagar
counterspeech Facebook stickers to empower people in Myanmar to share
positive messages online. We also recently released locally illustrated
false news tips, which were promoted on Facebook and in consumer print
publications. We have a dedicated Safety Page for Myanmar (https://
www.facebook.com/safety/resources/myanmar) and have delivered hard
copies of our local language Community Standards and safety and
security tips to civil society groups in Myanmar who have distributed
them around the country for trainings. Similarly, in Sri Lanka, we ran
a promotion in English, Sinhalese, and Tamil at the top of News Feeds
in April 2017 to educate people on our Community Standards, in
particular hate speech. The content has been viewed almost 100M times
by almost 4M people.
Question 13. When I chaired the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on
Human Rights and the Law, I held a series of hearings on Internet
freedom. I invited Facebook to testify at our 2010 hearing. Unlike
Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, Facebook declined.
Beginning in 2009, I urged you and other technology companies to
join the Global Network Initiative, a voluntary code of conduct that
requires participating companies to take reasonable measures to protect
human rights. Again, unlike Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft, you declined.
I reached out to you again in 2011 about serious concerns that
repressive governments were using Facebook to monitor and suppress
democracy activists.
I was glad when Facebook finally joined other major technology
companies and became a member of the Global Network Initiative in 2013.
But it's also clear that Facebook has lagged behind other technology
leaders in this area and that you continue to face serious ongoing
human rights challenges.
For example, human rights activists in Vietnam have expressed
concerns that Facebook is working with the Vietnamese government to
suppress dissent. A number of Vietnamese human rights activists and
independent media groups sent a letter to you yesterday that noted
``your company's aggressive practices . . . could silence human rights
activists and citizen journalists in Vietnam.''
The letter went on to say the following: ``We appreciate Facebook's
efforts in addressing safety and misinformation concerns online in
Vietnam and around the world. Yet it would appear that after this high
profile agreement to coordinate with a government that is known for
suppressing expression online and jailing activists, the problem of
account suspension and content takedown has only grown more acute.''
a. Can you comment on Facebook's commitment to human rights?
b. What is your response to this letter?
c. How is Facebook addressing free expression and user privacy
concerns in countries with repressive regimes?
Answer. Facebook is committed to respecting human rights. Since
2013, Facebook has been a member of the Global Network Initiative
(GNI), a multi-stakeholder digital rights initiative. As part of our
membership, Facebook has committed to the freedom of expression and
privacy standards set out in the GNI Principles--which are in turn
based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United
Nations Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights--and we are
independently assessed on our compliance with these standards on a
biennial basis. In keeping with these commitments, rigorous human
rights due diligence and careful consideration of free expression and
privacy implications would constitute important components of any
decision on entering China.
As a GNI member, Facebook is committed to privacy and free
expression principles and implementation guidelines regarding
government requests. The GNI standards have been shaped by
international human rights laws and norms and developed through a
robust multi-stakeholder and consultative process. The GNI principles
and guidelines inform Facebook's approach to evaluating government
requests for user data in all the markets where we operate.
Regarding the letter from Vietnamese human rights activists and
citizen journalists specifically, we are committed to protecting the
rights of people using Facebook in Vietnam, and to providing a place
where people can express themselves freely and safely.
Our Community Standards (https://www.facebook.com/
communitystandards), which outline what is and isn't allowed on
Facebook, seek to encourage expression and create a safe
community on the platform. We will remove content that violates
these standards when we're made aware of it.
There are also times when we may have to remove or restrict
access to content because it violates a law in a particular
country, even though it doesn't violate our Community
Standards. We have a well-established process for this, which
is no different in Vietnam to the rest of the world. Every
request we receive is checked for legal sufficiency. We require
officials to provide a detailed description of the legal and
factual basis for their request, and we push back when we find
legal deficiencies or overly broad or vague requests. We report
the number of pieces of content we restrict for contravening
local law in our Transparency Report.
We did not take any action on the accounts of the
signatories of the letter at the request of the Vietnamese
government, nor did we see mass reporting on their accounts.
We continue to work with partners in industry and civil
society to voice concerns about efforts to restrict expression
and limit the voice that people have online.
Question 14. Open Secrets recently reported that multimillionaire
donor Robert Mercer was behind a secretive dark money group called
Secure America Now. According to Open Secrets, this organization
``worked hand in hand with Facebook and Google to target their message
at voters in swing states who were most likely to be receptive to
them.''
Specifically, Secure America Now created mock travel ads that
invited visitors to the ``Islamic State of France,'' the ``Islamic
State of Germany,'' and the ``Islamic States of America.'' Each ad
began with an image of missiles shooting through the sky. The
``French'' ad included clips of blindfolded men with guns held to their
head and children training with weapons. The ``German'' ad discussed
``sell[ing] your daughter or sister to be married'' with the image of a
woman wearing a burka. The ``American'' ad had an image of Ground Zero
in New York City as a place where citizens ``celebrate Islamic
victories.''
The ads were clearly designed to stoke anti-Muslim sentiment in the
days leading up to the 2016 election.
a. Under your new policies, how will ads like this be handled in
the future?
b. Will Facebook continue to work with groups like Secure America
Now to create targeted, bigoted content?
Answer. We did not work directly with Secure America Now; we worked
through a third-party advertising agency. We did not create any content
for Secure America Now. As is customary across managed advertising
agencies, we provided a general best practices training to the agency
staff, and we provided the measurement tools to determine the efficacy
of the ads and differences between formats.
We require everyone on Facebook to comply with our Community
Standards, which outline what is and isn't allowed on Facebook.
Explicit in our Community Standards is our prohibition on hate
speech. We are opposed to hateful content in all its forms, and are
committed to removing it from our platform any time we become aware of
it. We're also committed to getting better at addressing these issues,
including improving specific policies, our review process, and
community reporting.
We have Community Standards that prohibit hate speech, bullying,
intimidation and other kinds of harmful behavior. We hold advertisers
to even stricter advertising policies to protect people from things
like discriminatory ads--and we have recently tightened our ad policies
even further to prohibit additional shocking and sensational content.
Question 15. As you noted in your testimony, before the 2017 French
election Facebook found and took down 30,000 fake accounts. Will you
commit to inform Congress and the public on a real-time basis how many
fake accounts Facebook takes down in the lead-up to the 2018 U.S.
midterm elections?
Answer. We recently released enforcement statistics in our
Community Standards Enforcement Report, including how many Facebook
accounts we took action on because we determined they were fake. We
will refine our approach over time, and we also hope to release
additional metrics in future reports.
Question 16. What percentage of current Facebook accounts do you
understand or estimate to be fake?
Answer. We estimate that fake accounts represented approximately 3
percent to 4 percent of monthly active users (MAU) on Facebook during
Q1 2018 and Q4 2017. We share this number in the Facebook quarterly
financial results. This estimate may vary each quarter based on spikes
or dips in automated fake account creation.
Question 17. I assume there is an advertising revenue loss when
Facebook deletes an account that is active but that is a fake or
imposter account created to sow disinformation. But it is important for
the public and Congress to know how many of these accounts there are
and whether they are being removed.
a. Will Facebook be transparent with Congress and the public about
how many active fake accounts Facebook is deleting?
b. How will Facebook enable Congress to track your progress in
addressing and removing fake accounts?
Answer. We publish information and metrics about fake accounts at
https://transparency.facebook.com/community-standards-enforcement#fake-
accounts and in our SEC filings. We estimate that fake accounts
represented approximately 3 percent to 4 percent of monthly active
users (MAU) on Facebook during Q1 2018 and Q4 2017. We share this
number in the Facebook quarterly financial results. This estimate may
vary each quarter based on spikes or dips in automated fake account
creation.
Question 18. You say in your testimony that Facebook now has about
15,000 people working on security and content review. How many of those
people are dedicated to identifying and removing fake accounts?
Answer. Estimating a number is difficult because stopping this type
of abuse is a focus for many teams, some more directly and some in more
of a supportive role. For example, we are expanding our threat
intelligence team, and more broadly, we are working now to ensure that
we will more than double the number of people working on safety and
security at Facebook, from 10,000 to 20,000, by the end of 2018. We
expect to have at least 250 people specifically dedicated to
safeguarding election integrity on our platforms, and that number does
not include the thousands of people who will contribute to this effort
in some capacity. Many of the people we are adding to these efforts
will join our ad review team, and we also expect to add at least 3,000
people to Community Operations, which reviews content that our users
and automated tools flag as inappropriate, dangerous, abusive, or
otherwise violating our policies.
Question 19. You stated during your testimony that Facebook has
built A.I. tools for identifying terror and extremist-related content
and that, for example, 99 percent of the ISIS and al-Qaeda content that
Facebook takes down is flagged first via A.I.
a. How much content did Facebook take down that was linked to ISIS
and al-Qaeda and what was the basis of your 99 percent statistic?
Please quantify this in terms of accounts closed per year or some other
quantifiable metric.
b. How much extremist content does Facebook take down that is not
first identified by A.I.? Please quantify this in terms of accounts
closed per year.
c. How much extremist content would you estimate is not removed by
Facebook because it is not flagged by A.I. or by users?
d. We are facing a rising threat from white supremacist and other
domestic extremist groups. An unclassified May 2017 FBI-DHS joint
intelligence bulletin found that ``white supremacist extremism poses
[a] persistent threat of lethal violence,'' and that white supremacists
``were responsible for 49 homicides in 26 attacks from 2000 to 2016 . .
. more than any other domestic extremist movement.'' And Politico
reported in August 2017 that ``suspects accused of extreme right-wing
violence have accounted for far more attacks in the U.S. than those
linked to foreign Islamic groups like al Qaeda and ISIS, according to
multiple independent studies.'' What specific steps is Facebook taking
to address extremist content from white supremacists and other domestic
terrorist threats?
Answer. While these metrics are in development, in Q1 2018, we took
action on 1.9 million pieces of terrorist propaganda content related to
ISIS, al-Qaeda, and their affiliates, up from 1.1 million in Q4 2017.
This increase is due to improvements in our ability to find violating
content using photo detection technology, which detects both old
content and newly posted content.
While these metrics are in development, in Q1 2018, we found and
flagged 99.5 percent of the terrorist propaganda content related to
ISIS, al-Qaeda, and their affiliates we subsequently took action on,
before users reported it. We acted on the other 0.5 percent because
users reported it to us first. The amount of content we flagged
increased from around 97 percent in Q4 2017 because we improved our
photo detection technology and processes to find and flag more content
before users reported it.
Terrorists, terrorist content, and hate speech in all forms--
including white supremacy and domestic terrorist content--have no place
on Facebook. We prohibit content that incites violence, and we remove
terrorists and posts that support terrorism whenever we become aware of
them. We are using a variety of tools in this fight.
Our policies against terrorist organizations and hate organizations
fall within the broader category of dangerous organizations and
individuals. We do not want Facebook to be a platform for hatred or
violence, so our policies apply to all groups that have engaged in
premeditated acts of violence or attacks on the basis of race,
religious affiliation, nationality, ethnicity, gender, sex, sexual
orientation, and serious disease or disability.
We define terrorism as ``Any non-governmental organization that
engages in premeditated acts of violence against persons or property to
intimidate a civilian population, government, or international
organization in order to achieve a political, religious, or ideological
aim.'' Our definition is agnostic to the ideology or political goals of
a group, which means it includes everything from religious extremists
and violent separatists to white supremacists and militant
environmental groups. It's about whether they use violence to pursue
those goals.
We are equally committed to identifying and rooting out domestic
hate organizations. We define hate organizations as ``Any association
of three or more people that is organized under a name, sign, or symbol
and that has an ideology, statements, or physical actions that attack
individuals based on characteristics, including race, religious
affiliation, nationality, ethnicity, gender, sex, sexual orientation,
and serious disease or disability.'' In evaluating groups and
individuals for designation as hateful, we have an extensive process
that takes into account a number of different signals, and regularly
engage with academics and organizations to refine this process.
Question 20. If Facebook's users have their personal information
misused without their knowledge and consent and then seek redress in
the court system, it is possible that the companies that misused their
information will try to force Facebook's users into mandatory
arbitration proceedings. These arbitration proceedings are typically
kept secret and rules are titled in favor of the repeat corporate
player and against the victims.
a. Do you think it is fair for Facebook users to be forced into
mandatory arbitration when they are trying to seek redress for
companies' misuse of their personal information?
b. Does Facebook prohibit apps that use the Facebook platform from
using mandatory arbitration clauses on Facebook users? If not, will you
commit to doing so going forward?
Answer. Our Terms of Service, available at https://
www.facebook.com/terms.php, addresses dispute resolution for users and
our Platform Policy, available at https://developers.facebook.com/
policy, lists the requirements for developers. Facebook's Terms do not
contain an arbitration clause and, in fact, we recently updated our
Terms to make it easier for users outside of the United States to
access court systems in their home countries.
Question 21. In December, the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) voted to dismantle net neutrality rules, paving the way for
Internet providers to block, throttle, or manipulate consumer access to
the Internet. This action threatens the right of every consumer to
access a free and open internet.
In the past, Facebook has expressed support for net neutrality
protections.
a. As one of the most visited websites in the world, how important
is net neutrality to Facebook's mission?
b. If left unchanged, what impact will the FCC's decision to undo
net neutrality protections have on Facebook's millions of users?
Answer. Keeping the Internet open for everyone is crucial. Not only
does it promote innovation, but it lets people access information that
can change their lives and gives voice to those who might not otherwise
be heard. For these reasons, Facebook supports net neutrality and is
open to working members of Congress and anyone else on a solution that
will preserve strong net neutrality protections.
______
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. Your written testimony referenced a number of policies
Facebook has planned or implemented to prevent foreign nationals from
using the platform to interfere in political and electoral processes.
a. How will you ensure that the companies advertising on Facebook
are who they purport and claim to be, rather than fronts for otherwise
prohibited users?
b. Do shell corporations impede your company's progress in
preventing abuse of your platform by foreign agents? If so, how?
c. Would incorporation transparency laws requiring the disclosure
of beneficial ownership information at the time of incorporation
enhance your ability to overcome those impediments?
Answer. We announced that only authorized advertisers will be able
to run electoral ads on Facebook or Instagram. And we're also extending
that requirement to anyone that wants to show ``issue ads''--like
political topics that are being debated across the country. We are
working with third parties to develop a list of key issues, which we
will refine over time. To get authorized by Facebook, advertisers will
need to confirm their identity and location. Advertisers will be
prohibited from running political ads--electoral or issue-based--until
they are authorized.
Further, we have processes designed to identify inauthentic and
suspicious activity and we also maintain a sanctions compliance program
to screen advertisers and paid app developers. Facebook's denied party
screening protocol involves checking paid app developers and
advertisers against applicable denied party listings. Those screened
remain in an on-going monitoring portfolio and are screened against
changes to applicable denied party listings. Moreover, our payments
subsidiaries file Suspicious Activity Reports on developers of certain
apps as appropriate.
However, like other offline and online companies, Facebook has
limited insight into the use of shell corporations or other
sophisticated structures that may disguise the true buyer. In addition,
the general challenge of attributing online activities to specific
governments or organizations is widely recognized in the intelligence
and law enforcement communities.
It is possible that such laws could help companies gain insight
into the use of shell corporations or other sophisticated structures
that may disguise the true buyer.
Question 2. With respect to the exchange below, is there anything
you would like to add to your statements about the process whereby
Facebook required Cambridge Analytica to certify that it had deleted
all improperly acquired data? Can you confirm that Facebook entered
into a legally binding contract with Cambridge Analytica surrounding
the deletion of unlawfully obtained user data? Would you be willing to
share a copy of the contract in question with the Senate Committees
before which you appeared, if so?
WHITEHOUSE: And with respect to Cambridge Analytica, your testimony
is that first you required them to formally certify that they had
deleted all improperly acquired data. Where did that formal
certification take place? That sounds kind of like a quasi-official
thing, to formally certify. What did that entail?
ZUCKERBERG: Senator, first they sent us an e-mail notice from their
chief data officer telling us that they didn't have any of the data any
more, that they deleted it and weren't using it. And then later we
followed up with, I believe, a full legal contract where they certified
that they had deleted the data.
WHITEHOUSE: In a legal contract?
ZUCKERBERG: Yes, I believe so.
On December 11, 2015, The Guardian published an article reporting
that Kogan and his company, GSR, may have passed information the app
had obtained from Facebook users to SCL Elections Ltd. (SCL)/Cambridge
Analytica. If this occurred, Kogan and his company violated Facebook's
Platform Policies, which explicitly prohibited selling user data
accessed from Facebook and from sharing any user data accessed from
Facebook with any ad network, data broker, or other advertising or
monetization related service.
For this reason, Facebook immediately banned the app from our
platform and investigated what happened and what further action we
should take to enforce our Platform Policies. Facebook also contacted
Kogan/GSR and demanded that they explain what data they collected, how
they used it, and to whom they disclosed it. Facebook further insisted
that Kogan and GSR, as well as other persons or entities to whom they
had disclosed any such data, account for and irretrievably delete all
such data and information.
Facebook also contacted Cambridge Analytica to investigate the
allegations reflected in the reporting. On January 18, 2016, Cambridge
Analytica provided written confirmation to Facebook that it had deleted
the data received from Kogan and that its server did not have any
backups of that data. On June 11, 2016, Kogan executed and provided to
Facebook signed certifications of deletion on behalf of himself and
GSR. The certifications also purported to identify all of the
individuals and entities that had received data from GSR (in addition
to Kogan and his lab), listing the following: SCL, Eunoia Technologies
(a company founded by Christopher Wylie), and a researcher at the
Toronto Laboratory for Social Neuroscience at the University of
Toronto. On July 7, 2016, a representative of the University of Toronto
certified that it deleted any user data or user-derived data. On August
16, 2016, Eunoia (executed by Eunoia Founder Christopher Wylie)
certified that it deleted any user and user-derived data. On September
6, 2016, counsel for SCL informed counsel for Facebook that SCL had
permanently deleted all Facebook data and derivative data received from
GSR and that this data had not been transferred or sold to any other
entity. On April 3, 2017. Alexander Nix, on behalf of SCL, certified to
Facebook, that it deleted the information that it received from GSR or
Kogan.
Because all of these concerns relate to activity that took place
off of Facebook and its systems, we have no way to confirm whether
Cambridge Analytica may have Facebook data without conducting a
forensic audit of its systems. Cambridge Analytica has agreed to submit
to a forensic audit, but we have not commenced that yet due to a
request from the UK Information Commissioner's Office, which is
simultaneously investigating Cambridge Analytica (which is based in the
UK). And even with an audit, it may not be possible to determine
conclusively what data was shared with Cambridge Analytica or whether
it retained data after the date it certified that data had been
deleted.
The existing evidence that we are able to access supports the
conclusion that Kogan only provided SCL with data on Facebook users
from the United States. While the accounts of Kogan and SCL conflict in
some minor respects not relevant to this question, both have
consistently maintained that Kogan never provided SCL with any data for
Facebook users outside the United States. These consistent statements
are supported by a publicly released contract between Kogan's company
and SCL.
Question 3. Until 2014, Facebook allowed ``friend permissiosn,''
which meant that if one of your Facebook friends connected an
authorized app to his Facebook account, the app could access not only
that person's personal information, but also your personal
information--and all of his other friends' personal information--
regardless of his friends' privacy settings. Facebook rightly changed
that permission in 2014.
a. Do you have an estimate as to how many third party entities were
authorized to collect friends' data while ``friend permission'' was in
effect?
b. Do you know what happened to that data and whether it was shared
further?
Answer. We are in the process of investigating every app that had
access to a large amount of information before we changed our Platform
in 2014. The investigation process is in full swing, and it has two
phases. First, a comprehensive review to identify every app that had
access to this amount of Facebook data and to focus on apps that
present reason for deeper investigation. And second, where we have
concerns, we will conduct interviews, make requests for information
(RFI)--which ask a series of detailed questions about the app and the
data it has access to--and perform audits using expert firms that may
include on-site inspections. We have large teams of internal and
external experts working hard to investigate these apps as quickly as
possible. To date thousands of apps have been investigated and around
200 apps have been suspended--pending a thorough investigation into
whether they did in fact misuse any data. Where we find evidence that
these or other apps did misuse data, we will ban them and let people
know.
These apps relate to a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You,
the Cambridge Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality, with many of the
suspended apps being affiliated with the same entity. Many of theses
suspensions include apps that appear to be ``test'' apps that were
never released to the public, and therefore would not have acquired
significant user data, although our investigation into these apps is
ongoing.
Additionally, we have suspended an additional 14 apps, which were
installed by around one thousand people. They were all created after
2014, after we made changes to more tightly restrict our platform APIs
to prevent abuse. However, these apps appear to be linked to AIQ, which
was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica. So, we have suspended them
while we investigate further. Any app that refuses to take part in or
fails our audit will be banned.
We will commit to briefing your staff on future developments.
c. How does Facebook audit third party applications to ensure that
they are who they say they are?
Answer. In general, on an ongoing basis, we proactively review all
apps seeking access to more than basic information (and have rejected
more than half of apps seeking such extended permissions). We also do a
variety of manual and automated checks to ensure compliance with our
policies and a positive experience for people. These include steps such
as random checks of existing apps along with the regular and proactive
monitoring of apps. We also respond to external or internal reports and
investigate for potential app violations. When we find evidence of or
receive allegations of violations, we investigate and, where
appropriate, employ a number of measures, including restricting
applications from our platform, preventing developers from building on
our platform in the future, and taking legal action where appropriate.
d. Do users have a way of tracking what data about them was shared
with third parties, including when this data is shared by their
friends? Should they?
Answer. With respect to our investigation into apps that had access
to large amounts of information, if we find evidence that these or
other apps did misuse data, we will ban them and notify people whose
data was shared with these apps.
Question 4. Aleksander Kogan purported to be a researcher when he
came to Facebook with the app Thisisyourdigitallife. He then funneled
the information he collected about Facebook's users to Cambridge
Analytica, which planned to use that information to influence Facebook
users' political opinions. How was Dr. Kogan vetted? What policies and
procedures does Facebook follow to ensure that researchers are who they
say they are and that their research is legitimate?
Answer. Facebook was put in touch with Kogan (a researcher at the
University of Cambridge) in late 2012, about a possible collaboration
on research relating to the potential relationship between Facebook
friendship ties and economic trade volumes between countries. Kogan
collaborated with current and former Facebook employees on
approximately ten academic papers. As part of these collaborations,
Kogan could only access fully anonymized, aggregated data from
Facebook. Facebook frequently partners with leading academic
researchers to address topics pertaining to wellbeing, innovation, and
other topics of public importance, following strict protocols to ensure
personal information is safeguarded.
Question 5. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) goes into
effect in Europe in May. It will require that users be afforded
meaningful opportunities for informed consent and the ability to opt-
out of direct marketing. It will also require data portability and give
users the right to access their personal data. Finally, it will mandate
privacy by design and require that users be informed within 72 hours of
a data breach. What is Facebook doing in Europe to get ready to comply
with GDPR?
Answer. The GDPR requires companies to obtain explicit consent to
process certain kinds of data (``special categories of data'' like
biometric data). We are seeking explicit consent from people in Europe
to three specific uses of data: facial recognition data (which
previously was not enabled in Europe), special categories of data, and
use of data we collect off Facebook Company Products to target ads. We
recently began providing direct notice of these controls and our
updated terms to people around the world (including in the U.S.),
allowing people to choose whether or not to enable or disable these
settings or to agree to our updated terms. Outside of Europe we are not
requiring people to complete those flows if they repeatedly indicate
that they do not want to go through the experience. At the same time,
the events of recent months have underscored how important it is to
make sure people know how their information is used and what their
choices are. So, we decided to communicate prominently on Facebook--
through a full-screen message and a reminder to review at a later date.
People can choose to dismiss or ignore these messages and continue
using Facebook.
We are also upgrading our tools for access, rectification, erasure,
data portability, and others to people in the U.S. and rest of world
that we provide in Europe, and many of those tools (like our Download
Your Information tool, Ads Preferences tool, and Activity Log) have
been available globally for many years.
Many of the requirements under GDPR previously applied to Facebook
Ireland under the Data Protection Directive, and we have therefore been
following these principles for many years. The GDPR is founded on core
principles of transparency and control, which are also central values
we employ in designing our products.
Question 6. You've made headlines recently by saying that Facebook
will not apply all of GDPR in the United States. Which GDPR
requirements is Facebook choosing not to apply in the U.S.? Why? What
parts of GDPR do you think the U.S. should import?
Answer. The controls and settings that Facebook is enabling as part
of GDPR are available to people around the world, including settings
for controlling our use of face recognition on Facebook and for
controlling our ability to use data we collect off Facebook Company
Products to target ads. We recently began providing direct notice of
these controls and our updated terms to people around the world
(including in the U.S.), allowing people to choose whether or not to
enable or disable these settings or to consent to our updated terms. We
provide the same tools for access, rectification, erasure, data
portability and others to people in the U.S. and rest of world that we
provide in Europe, and many of those tools (like our Download Your
Information tool, ad preferences tool, and Activity Log) have been
available globally for many years.
Question 7. Facebook has announced that it will begin placing ads
into a searchable database, which will include details about how much
the ads cost and what kinds of people the advertisers were targeting.
Ads will stay in the database for four years. Will the database include
information on the audience that advertisers were trying to target or
just the demographic information about which users were ultimately
reached?
Answer. The database will include demographic information (e.g.,
age, general location, gender) about the audience that the ads reached.
Question 8. As Chair of the Cybersecurity Task Force and a Co-Chair
of the International Creativity and Theft-Prevention Caucus, I have
focused time and attention on the issue of platform security and
responsibility--including as it relates to intellectual property theft.
What steps is Facebook taking to ensure that it provides a safe and
secure platform in this respect? Will you devote the resources
necessary to ensure that your platform and its features/tools,
including Facebook Live, are used in a responsible and legal fashion?
Answer. We take intellectual property rights seriously at Facebook
and work closely with the motion picture industries and other rights
holders worldwide to help them protect their copyrights and other IP.
Our measures target potential piracy across our products, including
Facebook Live, and continue to be enhanced and expanded. These include
a global notice-and-takedown program, a comprehensive repeat infringer
policy, integration with the content recognition service Audible Magic,
and our proprietary video- and audio-matching technology called Rights
Manager. More information about these measures can be found in our
Intellectual Property Help Center, Transparency Report, and Rights
Manager website.
Question 9. Your Q3 earnings disclosure in 2017 indicated that over
270 million Facebook accounts are fake or duplicate accounts. Fake and
imposter accounts have been identified as central to the disinformation
campaigns threatening democracies, and you have responded by banning
tens of thousands of these accounts to protect elections in France,
Germany, and Alabama. Do you intend to enforce your user policy and
track and delete as many fake and imposter accounts on your site as
possible and, if so, on what timeline? Are there circumstances under
which Facebook would track, but opt not to delete, inauthentic accounts
that may be involved in disinformation campaigns? What would such
circumstances be?
Answer. We are committed to finding and removing fake accounts. We
continue to make improvements to our efforts to more effectively detect
and deactivate fake accounts to help reduce the spread of spam, false
news, and misinformation. We continually update our technical systems
to identify, checkpoint, and remove inauthentic accounts, and we block
millions of attempts to register fake accounts every day. These systems
examine thousands of detailed account attributes and prioritize signals
that are more difficult for bad actors to disguise, such as their
connections to others on our platform. As with all security threats, we
have been incorporating new insights into our models for detecting fake
accounts, including information specific to election issues.
We do not share detailed descriptions of how our tools work in
order to avoid providing a road map to bad actors who are trying to
avoid detection. When we suspect that an account is inauthentic, we
typically enroll the account in a checkpoint that requires the account
holder to provide additional information or verification. We view
disabling an account as a severe sanction, and we want to ensure that
we are highly confident that the account violates our policies before
we take permanent action. When we have confirmed that an account
violates our policies, we remove the account.
Question 10. (a) How does Facebook define fake news?
(b) How does the company distinguish real news stories from fake
ones, if at all?
(c) What mechanisms, if any, does Facebook use to prevent news
stories identified as fake from appearing on users' news feeds?
(d) Does Facebook keep track of users who exhibit a pattern of
sharing fake news stories? Does it suspend users who exhibit such a
pattern? If not, would Facebook consider implementing a policy that
disciplines users who spread fake news? What else could Facebook do to
stop the spread of fake news?
Answer. At Facebook, we define false news as ``[n]ews articles that
purport to be factual, but which contain intentional misstatements of
fact with the intention to arouse passions, attract viewership, or
deceive.''
We believe that tech companies, media companies, newsrooms, and
educators all need to work together to address this societal problem.
We are engaged with partners across these industries to help create a
more informed community.
We are working to build a more informed community by promoting
trustworthy, informative, and local news and by focusing on four
different strategies to address misinformation:
Strengthening enforcement of our authenticity policies. We
are investing heavily in new technology and hiring thousands
more people to tackle the problem of inauthenticity on the
platform. Fake accounts are often associated with false news,
so this is an area that will have a huge impact on curbing the
spread of inaccurate information.
Finding industry solutions. All of us--from tech companies
and media companies to newsrooms and classrooms--must work
together to find industry solutions to strengthen the online
news ecosystem and our own digital literacy. That's why we're
collaborating with others who operate in this space. Last
January, we announced The Facebook Journalism Project, an
initiative that seeks to establish stronger ties between
Facebook and the news industry. The project is focused on
developing news products, providing training and tools for
journalists, and working with publishers and educators on how
we can equip people with the knowledge they need to be informed
readers in the digital age. Since launching the Journalism
Project, we've met with more than 2,600 publishers around the
world to understand how they use our products and how we can
make improvements to better support their needs.
Disrupting economic incentives. When it comes to fighting
false news, we've found that a lot of it is financially
motivated. So, one of the most effective approaches is removing
the economic incentives for those who traffic in inaccurate
information. We've done things like block ads from pages that
repeatedly share false news and significantly limit the
distribution of web pages that deliver low quality web
experiences.
Building new products. We believe it's important to amplify
the good effects of social media and mitigate the bad--to
contribute to the diversity of ideas, information, and view
points, while strengthening our common understanding. Among the
products we've launched is:
We believe giving people more context can help them
decide what to trust and what to share. The third-party
fact-checking program we have developed uses reports from
our community, along with other signals, to send stories to
accredited third-party fact checking organizations. If the
fact checking organizations identify a story as fake, we
will suggest related articles in News Feed to show people
different points of view, including information from fact
checkers. Stories that have been disputed may also appear
lower in News Feed. Our own data analytics show that a
false rating from one of our fact checking partners reduces
future impressions on Facebook by 80 percent.
We're also testing Article Context as a way of giving
people more information about the material they're reading
on Facebook. Since we launched this test, some of the
articles people see in News Feed will feature an ``i'' icon
that allows them to access more information at the tap of a
button. The information we surface is pulled from across
the internet, and includes things like the publisher's
Wikipedia entry, trending articles or related articles
about the topic, and information about how the article is
being shared on Facebook. In some cases, if that
information is unavailable, we will let people know since
that can also be helpful context.
Question 11. It is my understanding that Facebook currently
restricts notifications related to fake news to users who seek to share
the content in question. In other words, before sharing a story flagged
as fake on the site, a user will receive a warning that the story's
accuracy has been ``disputed.'' Does Facebook intend to expand the
existing policy and begin notifying individual users each time they
view (not just share) fake content? If not, why not?
Answer. As we announced in December 2017, we will no longer use
Disputed Flags to identify false news. Instead, we will use Related
Articles to help give people more context about the story. Academic
research on correcting misinformation has shown that putting a strong
image, like a red flag, next to an article may actually entrench deeply
held beliefs--the opposite effect to what we intended. Related
Articles, by contrast, are simply designed to give more context, which
our research has shown is a more effective way to help people get to
the facts. Indeed, we have found that when we show Related Articles
next to a false news story, it leads to fewer shares than when the
Disputed Flag is shown.
We are giving people more context about the information they see on
Facebook with Article Context. Since we launched this test, some of the
articles you see in News Feed will feature an ``i'' icon that allows
you to access more information at the tap of a button. The information
we surface is pulled from across the internet, and includes things like
the publisher's Wikipedia entry, trending articles or related articles
about the topic, and information about how the article is being shared
on Facebook. In some cases, if that information is unavailable, we will
let people know since that can also be helpful context.
We continue to look for opportunities to improve this experience
and help give people more context so that they can decide what to read,
trust, and share on Facebook.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Amy Klobuchar to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. In the hearing, I asked if Facebook had determined
whether the up to 87 million Facebook users whose data was shared with
Cambridge Analytica were concentrated in certain states. You said that
you could follow up with that information.
Can you provide a state-by-state breakdown of the Facebook
users whose data was improperly obtained by Cambridge
Analytica?
Answer. See the state breakdown here: https://
fbnewsroomus.files.wordpress.com
/2018/05/state-by-state-breakdown.pdf.
Question 2. As you know, I also asked whether any of the roughly
126 million people who may have been shown content from a Facebook page
associated with the Internet Research Agency were the same Facebook
users whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica. You said that
Facebook was investigating that question and that you believe it is
``entirely possible that there will be a connection there.''
Please provide an answer as to whether there was any overlap
between the Facebook users who were shown content from a
Facebook page associated with the Internet Research Agency and
those whose data was shared with Cambridge Analytica.
Answer. The targeting for the IRA ads that we have identified and
provided to the Senate Committee on the Judiciary and the Senate Select
Committee on Intelligence was relatively rudimentary, targeting very
broad locations and interests, and for example, only used custom
audiences in a very small percentage of its overall targeting and did
not use Contact List Custom Audiences. In addition, all of the custom
audiences used by the IRA were created based on user engagement with
certain IRA Pages. By contrast, Cambridge Analytica used hundreds of
Contact List Custom Audiences during the 2016 election cycle created
from contact lists that Cambridge Analytica uploaded to our system, and
Cambridge Analytica used those and other custom audiences in the
majority of its ads targeting in combination with demographic targeting
tools.
Question 3. When I asked if you would support a rule that would
require Facebook to notify users of a breach of their information
within 72 hours, you responded that such a rule makes sense to you and
that your team would follow up with my staff to discuss the details of
such a proposal.
I am working to introduce bipartisan legislation requiring
that online platforms notify users of a breach of their
information within 72 hours. Will Facebook support this
requirement?
What process would Facebook implement to notify users of a
breach of their information within 72 hours?
Answer. Facebook is generally open to the idea of breach
notification requirements, particularly legislation that would
centralize reporting and ensure a consistent approach across the United
States. For example, in Europe, the GDPR requires notification to a
lead supervisory authority, rather than individual member states, in
cases of a data breach. In the United States, however, there is no
centralized notification scheme, and instead, reporting obligations
vary widely across all 50 states. This complexity makes it harder to
respond appropriately and swiftly to protect people in the event of a
data breach. We believe this is an important issue and an area that is
ripe for thoughtful regulation.
Question 4. With more than two billion monthly active users,
Facebook is by far the largest social networking platform on the
internet. Some have called Facebook a monopoly and claimed that
Facebook has no true competition.
If a Facebook user living in the United States wanted to
switch to a different online social networking platform, what
are the top ten alternative social networking platforms
available? To the best of your knowledge, how many monthly
active users does each attract?
Answer. In Silicon Valley and around the world, new social apps are
emerging all the time. The average American uses eight different apps
to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people. There
is a lot of choice, innovation, and activity in this space, with new
competitors arising all the time. Facebook's top priority and core
service is to build useful and engaging products that enable people to
connect, discover and share through mobile devices and personal
computers. Given its broad product offerings, Facebook faces numerous
competitors, competing to attract, engage, and retain users, to attract
and retain marketers, and to attract and retain developers who build
compelling mobile and web applications. For instance, if you want to
share a photo or video, you can choose between Facebook, DailyMotion,
Snapchat, YouTube, Flickr, Twitter, Vimeo, Google Photos, and
Pinterest, among many other services. Similarly, if you are looking to
message someone, just to name a few, there's Apple's iMessage,
Telegram, Skype, Line, Viber, WeChat, Snapchat, and LinkedIn--as well
as the traditional text messaging services your mobile phone carrier
provides. Equally, companies also have more options than ever when it
comes to advertising--from billboards, print and broadcast, to newer
platforms like Facebook, Spotify, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Amazon, or
Snapchat. Facebook represents a small part (in fact, just 6 percent) of
this $650 billion global advertising ecosystem and much of that has
been achieved by helping small businesses--many of whom could never
have previously afforded newspaper or TV ads--to cost-effectively reach
a wider audience.
Question 5. Last week, legislation that I supported to combat
online sex trafficking--the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online
Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA)--was signed into law. Facebook also
supported that legislation.
What has Facebook observed in terms of efforts to facilitate
human trafficking on its platform, and what actions has
Facebook taken in response?
Answer. Sex trafficking has no place on Facebook. Our Community
Standards make it very clear that human trafficking and smuggling are
against our policies. This is true across the platform. We remove
content that threatens or promotes sexual violence, assault, or
exploitation, including against minors, when we become aware of it. We
have a team of professional investigators and work with agencies across
the world that seek to identify and rescue victims and bring
perpetrators to justice.
Facebook is committed to making our platform a safe place,
especially for individuals who may be vulnerable. We have a long
history of working successfully with governments to address a wide
variety of threats to our platform, including child exploitation. When
we learn of a situation involving physical abuse, child exploitation,
or an imminent threat of harm to a person, we immediately report the
situation to first responders or the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children (NCMEC).
Further, as part of official investigations, government officials
sometimes request data about people who use Facebook. We have processes
in place to handle these government requests, and we disclose account
records in accordance with our terms of service and applicable law. We
also have a global team that strives to respond within minutes to
emergency requests from law enforcement.
Our relationship with NCMEC also extends to an effort that we
launched in 2015 to send AMBER Alerts to the Facebook community to help
find missing children. When police determine that a case qualifies for
an AMBER Alert, the alert is issued by the NCMEC and distributed
through the Facebook system with any available information, including a
photograph of the missing child, a license plate number, and the names
and descriptions of the child and suspected abductor. Law enforcement
determines the range of the target area for each alert. We know the
chances of finding a missing child increase when more people are on the
lookout, especially in the critical first hours. Our goal is to help
get these alerts out quickly to the people who are in the best position
to help, and a number of missing children have been found through AMBER
Alerts on Facebook.
Further, we work tirelessly to identify and report child
exploitation images (CEI) to appropriate authorities. We identify CEI
through a combination of automated and manual review. On the automated
review side, we use image hashing to identify known CEI. On the manual
review side, we provide in-depth training to content reviewers on how
to identify possible CEI. Confirmed CEI is reported to the NCMEC, which
then forwards this information to appropriate authorities. When we
report content to the NCMEC, we preserve account information in
accordance with applicable law, which can help further law enforcement
investigations. We also reach out to law enforcement authorities in
serious cases to ensure that our reports are received and acted upon.
Since 2015 we have proactively engaged with relevant NGOs working
to safeguard girls and women from trafficking and violence to
understand where we can do more. This included a number of roundtables
on the topic of women's safety, including trafficking and prostitution.
For example:
X-Industry Child Safety Hackathon: In May 2016, we invited
over 75 engineers from across industry, including Microsoft and
Google, as well as from child safety NGOs, such as NCMEC,
Thorn, and InHope, to the Facebook campus in San Francisco for
the first-ever cross industry child safety hackathon to develop
tools and products that enhance child online safety (read more

solutions-child-safety/?utm_
campaign=coschedule&utm_source=facebook_page&utm_medium=Thorn&ut
m_
content=Hackathon%20Creates%20Tech%20Solutions%20for%20Child%20S
afety). We again hosted the hackathon in 2017 and have now
added the TechCoalition and Google as co-hosts to the event to
expand its scope and reach. One of the prototypes that came out
of the hackathon is a tool that enables people to match known
photos of missing children against online trafficking ads.
Roundtable with leading organizations to share best
practices and build network. On October 24, 2017, we hosted our
first anti-sex trafficking roundtable in Menlo Park. The
roundtable was attended by representatives from law enforcement
officials, government agencies and anti-trafficking non-
governmental organizations. The focus of the roundtable was to
allow participants to discuss and share expertise, experience,
and research. The Sex Trafficking Cross-functional Team will
continue to collaborate with both our internal and external
partners on the objectives, projects, and deliverables
discussed at the roundtable.
We have created shortcuts on Facebook and Instagram to provide
education and additional resources (developed in conjunction with the
National Human Trafficking Resource Center) to people who search for
terms related to sex trafficking. These terms have been provided by
internal and external experts and when someone searches for them on
Facebook, we will have a pop-up that reminds them sex trafficking is
illegal and violates our policies and shares resources for getting
help.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Christopher Coons to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. In 2015, Facebook learned that Aleksandr Kogan sold
users' data he obtained from an application to the political consulting
firm Cambridge Analytica in violation of Facebook's terms of service.
Facebook did not publicly disclose that Cambridge Analytica obtained
this user data until 2018, after public reports that Kogan had
improperly sold the data to Cambridge Analytica.
a. Why did you fail to tell the public until March 2018 that Kogan
sold the data to Cambridge Analytica?
b. Who specifically at Facebook made the decision not to tell the
public that millions of users' data was obtained by Cambridge Analytica
without their consent?
c. Your announcement that at least 87 million users had their
privacy violated came out only recently. In 2015, did you try to
determine the universe of users whose privacy was violated?
d. How long have you known the number of affected users was in the
millions?
Answer. When Facebook learned about Kogan's breach of Facebook's
data use policies in December 2015, we took immediate action. The
company retained an outside firm to assist in investigating Kogan's
actions, to demand that Kogan and each party he had shared data with
delete the data and any derivatives of the data, and to obtain
certifications that they had done so. Because Kogan's app could no
longer collect most categories of data due to changes in Facebook's
platform, our highest priority at that time was ensuring deletion of
the data that Kogan may have accessed before these changes took place.
With the benefit of hindsight, we wish we had notified people whose
information may have been impacted. Facebook has since notified all
people potentially impacted with a detailed notice at the top of their
newsfeed.
Question 2. In your testimony for the hearing, you noted, ``In
2015, we learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan had shared
data from his app with Cambridge Analytica.''
a. Prior to learning this from The Guardian, what steps was
Facebook taking to ensure that developers were not selling data to
third parties in violation of the site's terms of service?
Answer. Since 2014, Facebook has proactively reviewed any app
seeking to obtain extended permissions to data beyond a basic set of
data, and it has rejected more than half of the apps seeking these
permissions. Before we learned about the Guardian allegations and
through today, Facebook's policies regarding third-party usage of its
platform technologies have prohibited--and continue to prohibit--those
third-party app developers from selling or licensing user data accessed
from Facebook and from sharing any user data accessed from Facebook
with any ad network, data broker or other advertising or monetization-
related service. We take action on potential violations of our Platform
Policies based on proactive review, external reports, and other
signals.
b. Why did Facebook wait until eight months after The Guardian's
report about Cambridge Analytica to send a letter asking for
certification that the data was deleted?
Answer. Facebook did not wait until eight months after The
Guardian's report about Cambridge Analytica to seek assurance that the
data was deleted. Facebook contacted Cambridge Analytica the day the
article was released. About one month later, on January 18, 2016,
Cambridge Analytica assured Facebook in writing that it had deleted the
data received from Kogan/GSR and that their server contained no backups
of the data.
c. If it were not for The Guardian's reporting, would you have
learned that Kogan sold the data to Cambridge Analytica? If yes, how?
Answer. We learned from journalists at The Guardian that Kogan may
have shared data from his app with Cambridge Analytica. We would have
acted in response to any external report, user report, or other signal
to investigate these allegations and take appropriate action.
d. It is likely that there will not always be a newspaper reporting
on every application developer that improperly sells user data. Has
Facebook ever proactively (i.e., without being alerted by another
party) learned about a similar violation of its terms of service--
selling or transferring user data without consent to a third party--and
if so, how? How many other such instances have you discovered?
Answer. We regularly take enforcement action against apps. For
example, in 2017, we took action against about 370,000 apps, ranging
from imposing certain restrictions to removal of the app from the
platform.
As part of the app investigation and audit we announced in March,
we have suspended 200 apps, pending a thorough investigation into
whether they did in fact misuse any data. These apps relate to a
handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You, the Cambridge
Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality, with many of the suspended
apps being affiliated with the same entity. Many of these apps also
appear to be ``test'' apps that were never released to the public, and
therefore would not have acquired significant user data, although our
investigation into these apps is ongoing.
Additionally, we have suspended an additional 14 apps, which were
installed by around one thousand people. They were all created after
2014, after we made changes to more tightly restrict our platform APIs
to prevent abuse. However, these apps appear to be linked to AIQ, which
was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica. So, we have suspended them
while we investigate further. Any app that refuses to take part in or
fails our audit will be banned.
Question 3. Why did Facebook only recently suspend Cambridge
Analytica's and Aleksandr Kogan's Facebook accounts when you knew about
the illicit transfer of user data back in 2015?
a. Why did Facebook fail to take legal action back in 2015 when it
learned from The Guardian that Kogan sold the data to Cambridge
Analytica?
b. After Cambridge Analytica's acquisition of data came to
Facebook's attention in 2015, did any policy or process change within
your company in response? Please describe any such changes and when
they occurred.
Answer. See Response to Question 1.
Question 4. In 2014, Facebook stopped allowing applications access
to the profiles of a user's friends, but for applications like
Aleksandr Kogan's, you still allowed access to friends' data for
another year. Why did Facebook permit other applications continued
access to that data for another year?
Answer. In April 2014, we announced that we would more tightly
restrict our platform APIs to prevent abuse. At that time we made clear
that existing apps would have a year to transition--at which point they
would be forced (1) to migrate to the more restricted API and (2) be
subject to Facebook's new review and approval protocols. A small number
of developers asked for and were granted short-term extensions beyond
the one-year transition period, the longest of which lasted several
months. These extensions ended several years ago. A transition period
of this kind is standard when platforms implement significant changes
to their technology base and was necessary here to avoid disrupting the
experience of millions of people. New apps that launched after April
30, 2014 were required to use our more restrictive platform APIs.
Question 5. Can you now confirm that Cambridge Analytica and its
partners, AggregateIQ and Strategic Communications Laboratories, have
deleted the Facebook data they received from Aleksandr Kogan? If not,
why not?
a. Has Facebook ever attempted to prevent Cambridge Analytica from
offering products or services that rely on or use the data it
improperly obtained from Kogan?
b. Is there anything that will prevent Cambridge Analytica from
offering products or services that rely on or use the illicitly
acquired Facebook data in the 2018 and 2020 elections?
Answer. Facebook obtained written certifications from Kogan, GSR,
and other third parties (including Cambridge Analytica and SCL)
declaring that all data they had obtained, and any derivatives, was
accounted for and destroyed. Based on recent allegations, we have
reopened our investigation into the veracity of these certifications
and have hired a forensic auditor to conduct a forensic audit of
Cambridge Analytica's systems. We are currently paused on the audit at
the request of the UK Information Commissioner's Office request, which
is conducting a regulatory investigation into Cambridge Analytica
(based in the UK), and we hope to move forward with that audit soon.
We have suspended SCL/Cambridge Analytica from purchasing
advertising on Facebook as well as removed the personal accounts of
some of their officers.
Question 6. You wrote in your testimony that, in March 2018,
Facebook hired a firm to conduct a forensic audit of Cambridge
Analytica and Kogan. Why did Facebook wait until March of 2018 to
conduct an audit of Cambridge Analytica's and Kogan's systems to ensure
the data was destroyed, when the company has known for three years that
the data was misappropriated?
Answer. Facebook knew about Cambridge Analytica in 2015, when
Facebook banned Kogan's app from our platform and investigated what
happened and what further action Facebook should take to enforce our
Platform Policies. Facebook considered the matter closed after
obtaining written certifications and confirmations from Kogan, GSR,
Cambridge Analytica, and SCL declaring that all such data they had
obtained was accounted for and destroyed.
We did not have any reason to affirmatively question the veracity
of any of these certifications until March 2018, when we learned that
questions had been raised concerning the accuracy of the
certifications. Moreover, while Facebook's policies in place at the
time allowed us to audit apps to ensure that they were safe and did not
violate its terms, we had already terminated Kogan's app's access to
Facebook (and there was no intention of considering its reinstatement).
Accordingly, there were no ongoing concerns about the level of data
that app could access or might access in the future.
Facebook, and Mr. Zuckerberg, became aware from media reporting in
March 2018 that the certifications we received may not have been
accurate. Facebook immediately banned Cambridge Analytica and SCL from
purchasing advertisements on our services as well as removed the
personal accounts of some of their officers.
Question 7. In an interview with CBS's 60 Minutes, Aleksandr Kogan
estimated that ``tens of thousands'' of application developers had
similar access to their participants' friends' profiles.
a. Approximately how many other application developers had access
to their users' friends' profiles, like Kogan?
Answer. Facebook is in the process of investigating all the apps
that had access to large amounts of information, such as extensive
friends data (if those friends privacy data settings allowed sharing),
before we changed our platform policies in 2014--significantly reducing
the data apps could access. Where we have concerns about individual
apps, we are investigating them--and any app that either refuses or
fails an audit will be banned from Facebook. To date thousands of apps
have been investigated and around 200 have been suspended--pending a
thorough investigation into whether they did in fact misuse any data.
These apps relate to a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You,
the Cambridge Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality, with many of the
suspended apps being affiliated with the same entity. Many of these
apps also appear to be ``test'' apps that were never released to the
public, and therefore would not have acquired significant user data,
although our investigation into these apps is ongoing.
Additionally, we have suspended an additional 14 apps, which were
installed by around one thousand people. They were all created after
2014, after we changed our platform to reduce data access. However,
these apps appear to be linked to AIQ, which was affiliated with
Cambridge Analytica. So, we have suspended them while we investigate
further. Any app that refuses to take part in or fails our audit will
be banned.
b. Has Facebook ever learned of an application developer other than
Kogan transferring or selling user data without user consent and in
violation of Facebooks terms of service to a third party?
Answer. The ability for app developers to share data entrusted to
them is an industry-wide challenge, which impacts every major app
platform. We will investigate all apps that had access to large amounts
of data before the platform changes we announced in 2014, and among
other things, analyze potentially suspicious activity from our analysis
of logs and usage patterns by these apps. Where we have concerns, we
will conduct an audit using internal and external experts and ban any
developer that refuses to comply. If we identify misuses of data, our
enforcement actions may include banning the app from our platform and
pursuing legal action if appropriate.
Question 8. Have there been instances in which Facebook discovered
misuse of user data by application developers in any way other than
transferring or selling data without user consent?
a. If so, how many additional instances does Facebook currently
know about?
b. Have you notified any users in these cases? If not, will you
commit to doing so?
c. Will you commit to publicly announcing and notifying users of
every future violation of Facebook's terms of service by application
developers?
Answer. We are in the process of investigating every app that had
access to a large amount of information before we changed our platform
in 2014. The investigation process is in full swing, and it has two
phases. First, a comprehensive review to identify every app that had
access to this amount of Facebook data and to focus on apps that
present reason for deeper investigation. And second, where we have
concerns, we will conduct interviews, make requests for information
(RFI)--which ask a series of detailed questions about the app and the
data it has access to--and perform audits using expert firms that may
include on-site inspections. We have large teams of internal and
external experts working hard to investigate these apps as quickly as
possible. To date thousands of apps have been investigated and around
200 apps have been suspended--pending a thorough investigation into
whether they did in fact misuse any data. Where we find evidence that
these or other apps did misuse data, we will ban them and let people
know.
These apps relate to a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You,
the Cambridge Psychometrics Center, and myPersonality, with many of the
suspended apps being affiliated with the same entity. Many of these
suspensions include apps that appear to be ``test'' apps that were
never released to the public, and therefore would not have acquired
significant user data, although our investigation into these apps is
ongoing.
Additionally, we have suspended an additional 14 apps, which were
installed by around one thousand people. They were all created after
2014, after we made changes to more tightly restrict our platform APIs
to prevent abuse. However, these apps appear to be linked to AIQ, which
was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica. So, we have suspended them
while we investigate further. Any app that refuses to take part in or
fails our audit will be banned.
We will commit to briefing your staff on future developments.
Question 9. The Guardian recently reported that Joseph Chancellor,
former co-director of Aleksandr Kogan's company, Global Science
Research (GSR), has been working as a quantitative social psychologist
at Facebook since 2015. In an interview for CBS's 60 Minutes, Kogan was
asked whether Chancellor had anything to do with the study he did for
Cambridge Analytica. He replied, ``Yes. I mean, we did everything
together.''
a. Does Facebook continue to employ Chancellor, knowing since 2015
that he was involved in GSR's harvesting and sale of Facebook data to
Cambridge Analytica? If so, why?
b. Facebook banned Aleksandr Kogan's account and required that he
certify the user data he harvested was deleted. Did Facebook take
similar actions against Chancellor? If not, why not?
Answer. We are investigating Mr. Chancellor's work with Kogan/GSR.
Question 10. Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie
testified to the U.K. House of Commons that Russian intelligence
agencies easily could have put a key logger in Aleksandr Kogan's
computer during his regular trips to Russia to get his psychological
profiles of Americans. Is Facebook aware of whether Russia or other
foreign governments accessed Kogan's data?
Answer. We are not aware of any evidence to suggest that Kogan
shared data obtained through his app with Russia or other foreign
governments, but our investigation is ongoing.
a. Is Facebook aware of any instances in which foreign governments
accessed user data from third-party application developers?
Answer. We are in the process of investigating every app that had
access to a large amount of information before we changed our Platform
in 2014.
b. What steps is Facebook taking to ensure that foreign governments
cannot access the private information of U.S. citizens held by
application developers?
Answer. In April 2014, we announced that we would more tightly
restrict our platform APIs to prevent abuse. At that time we made clear
that existing apps would have a year to transition--at which point they
would be forced (1) to migrate to the more restricted API and (2) be
subject to Facebook's new review and approval protocols. A small number
of developers asked for and were granted short-term extensions beyond
the one-year transition period, the longest of which lasted several
months. These extensions ended several years ago. A transition period
of this kind is standard when platforms implement significant changes
to their technology base and was necessary here to avoid disrupting the
experience of millions of people. New apps that launched after April
30, 2014 were required to use our more restrictive platform APIs. We
required apps seeking additional categories of data to undergo
proactive review by our internal teams. We rejected more than half of
the apps seeking these permissions, including the second version of
Kogan's app.
We review apps to ensure that the requested permissions clearly
improve the user experience and that the data obtained is tied to an
experience within the app. We conduct a variety of manual and automated
checks of applications on the platform for Policy compliance, as well
as random sampling. When we find evidence of or receive allegations of
violations, we investigate and, where appropriate, employ a number of
measures, including restricting applications from our platform,
preventing developers from building on our platform in the future, and
taking legal action where appropriate.
Recently, we announced a number of additional steps we're taking to
address concerns raised by Kogan's app.
Review our platform. We will investigate all apps that had
access to large amounts of data before the platform changes we
announced in 2014, and we will audit any app where we identify
suspicious activity. If we identify misuses of data, we'll take
immediate action, including banning the app from our platform
and pursuing legal action if appropriate.
Tell people about data misuse. We will tell people about
apps that have misused their data. This includes building a way
for people to know if their data might have been accessed via
the app. Moving forward, if we remove an app for misusing data,
we will tell everyone who used it.
Turn off access for unused apps. If someone has not used an
app within the last three months, we will turn off the app's
access to their data.
Restrict Facebook Login data. We are changing Login, so that
the only data that an app can request without app review will
include name, profile photo, and e-mail address. Requesting any
other data will require approval from Facebook. We will also no
longer allow apps to ask for access to information like
religious or political views, relationship status and details,
custom friends lists, education and work history, fitness
activity, book reading and music listening activity, news
reading, video watch activity, and games activity. We will
encourage people to manage the apps they use. We already show
people what apps their accounts are connected to and allow them
to control what data they've permitted those apps to use. But
we're making it easier for people to see what apps they use and
the information they have shared with those apps.
Reward people who find vulnerabilities. We launched the Data
Abuse Bounty program so that people can report to us any
misuses of data by app developers.
Update our policies. We have updated our terms and Data
Policy to explain how we use data and how data is shared with
app developers.
c. Is there a way for Facebook to affirmatively track Facebook data
that application developers download from the platform such that you
know when that data has been improperly accessed or transferred?
Answer See Response to Question 10, part b.
Question 11. Why did Facebook threaten The Guardian with legal
action after it sought to publish an interview with former Cambridge
Analytica employee Christopher Wylie? Has Facebook ever taken legal
action against a current or former employee who attempted to, or did,
expose violations of user agreements?
Answer. Facebook did not threaten to sue The Guardian. We sent The
Guardian a letter to correct some facts in the article they sought to
publish. Facebook supports vocal, independent journalism.
Question 12. Facebook sends employees or affiliates to work as
consultants with campaigns to help shape digital strategy, content, and
execution. Do you plan to embed such Facebook consultant embeds in
major political campaigns in the 2018 and 2020 elections? If yes, what
will Facebook instruct such consultant embeds about their
responsibility to monitor for improper uses of Facebook user data or
breaches of the Facebook user agreement?
Answer. We want all candidates, groups, and voters to use our
platform to engage in elections. We want it to be easy for people to
find, follow, and contact their elected representatives--and those
running to represent them. That's why, for candidates across the
political spectrum, Facebook offers the same levels of support in key
moments to help campaigns understand how best to use the platform.
a. Were any of Facebook's consultant embeds in 2016 aware of the
user data improperly acquired by Cambridge Analytica?
Answer. While our investigation is ongoing, our review indicates
that Facebook employees did not identify any issues involving the
improper use of Facebook data in the course of their interactions with
Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign.
b. Did Facebook consultant embeds work with Cambridge Analytica in
shaping strategy for any U.S. campaigns in 2016?
Answer. In general, political data firms working on the 2016
campaign had access to Facebook's advertising support services,
including technical support, and best practices guidance on how to
optimize their use of Facebook.
Question 13. In 2011, Facebook entered into a binding consent
decree with the FTC, in which it promised to get users' consent before
sharing their data with third parties. Yet, as late as 2015, app
developers had access to the Facebook profiles of the friends of users
who downloaded their apps, without the friends' knowledge or consent.
Why did Facebook permit this even after entering into the consent
decree with the FTC?
a. In the consent decree, Facebook further agreed to report any
unauthorized access to data to the FTC. Did Facebook ever report to the
FTC that Cambridge Analytica accessed the profiles of at least 87
million Facebook users without Facebook's authorization or those users'
consent?
b. If not, why not, and who made the decision that this did not
have to be reported to the FTC?
Answer. We furnished extensive information to the FTC regarding the
ability for users to port their Facebook data (including friends data
that had been shared with them) with apps on Facebook's platform, as
part of the FTC's investigation culminating in the July 27, 2012
Consent Order. The Consent Order memorializes the agreement between
Facebook and the FTC and did not require Facebook to turn off or change
the ability for people to port friends data that had been shared with
them on Facebook to apps they used. Facebook voluntarily changed this
feature of Platform in 2014, however.
Instead, and among other things, the consent order obligates
Facebook not to misrepresent the extent to which it maintains the
privacy or security of covered information (Section I), not to
materially exceed the restrictions of a privacy setting that applies to
nonpublic user information without affirmative express consent (Section
II), and to implement a comprehensive privacy program that is subjected
to ongoing review by an independent assessor (Sections IV and V).
Facebook (i) accurately represented the operation of its developer
Platform and the circumstances under which people could share data
(including friends data) with developers at all times; (ii) honored the
restrictions of all privacy settings that covered developer access to
data (including settings that allowed people to turn off the ability of
their friends to share their data with apps); and (iii) implemented a
comprehensive privacy program build on industry-leading controls and
principles, which has undergone ongoing review by an independent
assessor approved by the FTC.
The Consent Order does not contain ongoing reporting obligations to
the FTC of the sort suggested in this question. Moreover, Kogan was
authorized to access all data that he obtained through Facebook's
platform by the people who authorized his app, and no data was shared
with Kogan relating to friends who had enabled settings preventing
their data from being shared with apps by their friends.
Question 14. Last year, Facebook generated almost $40 billion in
advertising revenues. How much is Facebook spending on data privacy and
security?
a. How much is Facebook spending to ensure compliance with civil
rights laws?
Answer. We do not have a single budget line-item for these efforts.
b. The NAACP, Muslim Advocates, the Leadership Conference, the
Southern Poverty Law Center, and over a dozen other civil rights
organizations asked for a third-party civil rights audit of Facebook's
policies in October 2017. Will you commit to hiring an independent
third party to conduct an audit focused on civil rights and privacy?
Answer. Relman, Dane & Colfax, a respected civil rights law firm,
will carry out a comprehensive civil rights assessment of Facebook's
services and internal operations. Laura Murphy, a national civil
liberties and civil rights leader, will help guide this process--
getting feedback directly from civil rights groups, like The Leadership
Conference on Civil and Human Rights, and help advise Facebook on the
best path forward.
Question 15. Does Facebook use artificial intelligence to analyze
content posted by users in order to assist in the creation of targeted
advertisements? How many individuals are involved in reviewing
advertisements that are targeted using personal information?
Answer. Facebook does not analyze the content of photos or text in
users' posts or messages to target ads to them using AI or otherwise.
Instead, there are a few primary ways that we personalize the ads and
sponsored content for people on Facebook, based on:
Information from people's use of Facebook. When people use
Facebook, they can choose to share things about themselves like
their age, gender, hometown, or interests. They can also click
or like posts, Pages, or articles. We use this information to
understand what users might be interested in and hopefully show
them ads that are relevant. If a bike shop comes to Facebook
wanting to reach female cyclists in Atlanta, we can show their
ad to women in Atlanta who liked a Page about bikes. People can
always see the ``interests'' assigned to them in their ad
preferences, and if they want, remove them.
Information that an advertiser shares with us (or ``custom
audiences''). In this case, advertisers bring us the customer
information so they can reach those people on Facebook. These
advertisers might have people's e-mail address from a purchase
users made, or from some other data source. If we have matching
e-mail addresses, we can show those people ads from that
advertiser (although we cannot see the e-mail addresses which
are sent to us in hashed form, and these are deleted as soon as
we complete the match). In ad preferences people can see which
advertisers with their contact information are currently
running campaigns--and they can click the top right corner of
any ad to hide all ads from that business.
Information that websites and apps send to Facebook. Some of
the websites and apps people visit may use Facebook tools to
make their content and ads more relevant, if people consent to
let Facebook show them ads based on data from third-party
partners. For example, if an online retailer is using Facebook
Pixel, they can ask Facebook to show ads to people who looked
at a certain style of shoe or put a pair of shoes into their
shopping cart. If users don't want this data used to show them
ads, they can turn it off in ad preferences.
Facebook also offers Lookalike Audiences. Advertisers
creating a Lookalike Audience choose a source audience (which
could include a custom audience as described above, people who
have opened or completed a form in lead ads on Facebook, people
who have interacted with the advertiser's Facebook page or its
Instagram profile). Facebook then identifies common qualities
of the people in the source audience (e.g., demographic
information or information about their interests), and then
identifies people who are similar to them (on the basis of the
common signals identified in the source audience), without
sharing this information with the advertiser.
We have thousands of people whose job it is to help review ads for
compliance with our policies. We recently announced that we are hiring
thousands of additional reviewers this year.
Question 16. Would it be possible to create a one-click way for a
Facebook user to opt out of targeted advertising?
a. Why did you decide not to offer that option to users?
b. Will you commit to offering that option in the future?
c. Have you considered creating a one-click way for a user to
prevent Facebook from collecting and storing data beyond what
individual users elect to post?
Answer. Users can't opt out of seeing ads altogether because
selling ads are what keep Facebook free, but they do have different
options to control how their data can and can't be used to show them
ads. They're all found in ad preferences, which allows users to turn
off the use of all data collected from partners off Facebook to target
ads.
Users can also decide which of their profile fields they want used
for ad targeting in the Information section under ``About you.'' Users
can remove themselves from interests under ``Your interests'' and
categories under ``Your categories.''
Question 17. What do Facebook and its subsidiary companies consider
``private'' information that is not collected or used for advertising
purposes? Is there any content that users provide or post that Facebook
does not analyze or review for advertising purposes?
Answer. As explained in our Data Policy, we collect three basic
categories of data about people: (1) data about things people do and
share (and who they connect with) on our services, (2) data about the
devices people use to access our services, and (3) data we receive from
partners, including the websites and apps that use our business tools.
Our Data Policy provides more detail about each of the three
categories.
We use data from each of the categories described above to obtain
these interests and to personalize every aspect of our services, which
is the core value we offer and the thing that makes Facebook services
unique from other online experiences. This includes selecting and
ranking relevant content, including ads, posts, and Page
recommendations, to cite but a few examples.
For example, we use the data people provide about their age and
gender to help advertisers show ads based on those demographics but
also to customize the pronouns on our site and deliver relevant
experiences to those users.
We use data about things people do on Facebook, such as the Pages
they like, to associate ``interests'' with their accounts, so we can
rank posts relating to those interests higher in NewsFeed, for example,
or enable advertisers to reach audiences--i.e., groups of people--that
share those interests. For example, if a person has liked Pages about
baseball, we might associate them with interests called ``baseball'' or
``sports.''
We use data from devices (such as location data) to help
advertisers reach people in particular areas. For example, if people
have shared their device locations with Facebook or checked into a
specific restaurant, we can show them organic posts from friends who
have been in that location or we can show them ads from an advertiser
that wants to promote its services in their area or from the
restaurant.
We also help advertisers reach people who have given the advertiser
their contact information or who have used the advertiser's website or
app. For example, advertisers can send us a hashed list of e-mail
addresses of people they would like to reach on Facebook. If we have
matching e-mail addresses, we can show those people ads from that
advertiser (although we cannot see the e-mail addresses which are sent
to us in hashed form, and these are deleted as soon as we complete the
match).
Again, for people who are new to Facebook, we may have minimal data
that we can use to personalize their experience, including their News
Feed, their recommendations and the content (organic and sponsored)
that they see. For people who have used our services for longer, we
likely have more data, but the amount of data will depend on the nature
of that use and how they have used our controls.
In addition to general controls--such as Activity Log--we provide
controls that specifically govern the use of data for ads. Through Ad
Preferences, people see and control things like: (1) their
``interests,'' which are keywords associated with a person based on
activities such liking Pages and clicking ads; (2) their ``behaviors''
(which we also call ``categories''), which generally reflect how, when
and where they connect to Facebook; and (3) the advertisers that are
currently showing them ads based on the person's contact information,
based on the person's previous use of the advertiser's website or app,
or based on a visit to the advertiser's store. People also can choose
whether we use information about their activities on websites and apps
off of Facebook to show them ads through Facebook, and whether we can
use their Facebook advertising interests to show them ads off of
Facebook. People's use of these controls will, of course, affect the
data we use to show them ads.
Question 18. If a user leaves Facebook and affirmatively deletes
his/her account, do you destroy his/her data?
a. What, if any, information is retained after a user profile is
deleted?
b. If any data is retained by Facebook, what is that data used for?
Answer. In general, when a user deletes their account, we delete
things they have posted, such as their photos and status updates, and
they won't be able to recover that information later. (Information that
others have shared about them isn't part of their account and won't be
deleted.)
There are some limited exceptions to these policies: For instance,
information can be accessed and preserved for an extended period when
it is the subject of a legal request or obligation, governmental
investigation, or investigations of possible violations of our terms or
policies, or otherwise to prevent harm. We also retain information from
accounts disabled for terms violations for at least a year to prevent
repeat abuse or other term violations.
Question 19. At your hearing before the House Committee on Commerce
and Energy, when asked by Representative Gene Greene if you would
``commit today that Facebook will extend the same protections to
Americans that Europeans users will receive under the GDPR,'' you
replied: ``Yes Congressman, we believe that everyone around the world
deserves good privacy controls. We've had a lot of these privacy
controls in place for years, the GDPR requires us to do a few more
things, and we're going to extend that to the world.'' However, Reuters
recently reported that, before the GDPR becomes effective in the EU in
May, you plan to move non-European users' data--including profile data
on 1.5 billion users from Africa, Asia, Australia, and Latin America--
from Ireland to Silicon Valley in order to ``reduce exposure'' to the
GDPR (available at https://www.reuters.com/article/us-facebook-privacy-
eu
-exclusive/exclusive-facebook-to-put-1-5-billion-users-out-of-reach-of-
new-eu-privacy-law-idUSKBN1HQ00P).
a. Can you confirm that the reason you are moving 1.5 billon users'
data is to avoid unnecessary exposure to the GDPR?
Answer. No, that is not the reason. The change referred to in this
question involves the legal entity with which Facebook users contract
when they use the service, which changed in some jurisdictions as a
part of the most recent updates to our Terms of Service and Data
Policy. This change did not impact people who live in the United
States, who contract with Facebook, Inc. under both our new and old
policies.
The substantive protections in our user agreements offered by
Facebook Ireland and Facebook, Inc. are the same. However, there are
certain aspects of our Facebook Ireland Data Policy that are specific
to legal requirements in the GDPR--such as the requirement that we
provide contact information for our EU Data Protection Officer (DPO) or
that we identify the ``legal bases'' we use for processing data under
the GDPR. Likewise, our Facebook Ireland terms and Data Policy address
the lawful basis for transferring data outside the EU, based on legal
instruments that are applicable only to the EU.
We are also looking to be more responsive to regional norms and
legal frameworks going forward, and want to have the flexibility to
work with local regulators, which is possible with this new model. At
the same time, we are changing the provisions in our Facebook, Inc.
terms in our user agreements outside the United States to allow people
in other countries to file lawsuits against Facebook in their home
country, rather than in courts in the U.S. This transition was part of
a continued effort to be locally responsive in countries where people
use our services.
b. Do you agree that such a move fails to show your willingness to
apply stronger privacy controls and practices to all of your users?
Answer. No. See the answer above. In addition, the controls and
settings that Facebook is enabling as part of GDPR are already
available to other users around the world, including settings for
controlling our use of face recognition on Facebook and for controlling
our ability to use data we collect off Facebook Company Products to
target ads. We also provide the same tools for access, rectification,
erasure, data portability and others to users in the U.S. and rest of
world that we provide in Europe, and many of those tools (like our
Download Your Information tool, Ads Preferences tool, and Activity Log)
have been available globally for many years.
c. Is your response to Representative Greene at your hearing, that
you were ``going to extend [the things required by the GDPR] to the
world,'' consistent with Facebook's actions to relocate massive amounts
of user data outside of the EU following your hearings?
Answer. We are not relocating people's data. To enable people to
access Facebook globally and communicate with people throughout the
world, we maintain data centers in multiple locations around the world.
We typically store people's information in multiple data centers, and
that is not changing. We are instead changing the entity that provides
the service for users outside of Europe and North America to Facebook,
Inc., for the reasons set forth above. We are offering the same
controls and settings to people everywhere.
Question 20. Facebook continues to find Russian trolls operating on
your platform. At your hearing, you stated, ``just last week, we were
able to determine that a number of Russian media organizations that
were sanctioned by the Russian regulator were operated and controlled
by this Internet Research Agency.'' Hate groups thrive on Facebook even
though your policies prohibit hate speech and glorifying violence. Fake
duplicate profiles of real users frequently appear on the site in spite
of Facebook policy prohibiting them. This recently happened to me, and
I had to alert Facebook in order to have this false profile taken down.
Why does Facebook shift the burden to its users to flag inappropriate
content--is it not Facebook's job to protect its users?
Answer. Facebook does not ``shift the burden'' to users to flag
inappropriate content, though we encourage people to report posts to
help us find and take action on inappropriate content. Advances in
technology, including in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and
computer vision mean that we can now remove bad content faster, get to
more content, and increase the capacity of our review team. It has
taken time to develop this software--and we're constantly pushing to
improve it. We do this by analyzing specific examples of bad content
that have been reported and removed to identify patterns of behavior.
These patterns can then be used to teach our software to proactively
find other, similar problems. But understanding the context of speech,
for example, often requires human eyes--is something hateful, or is it
being shared to condemn hate speech or raise awareness about it? We've
started using technology to proactively detect something that might
violate our policies, starting with certain languages such as English
and Portuguese. Our teams then review the content so what's OK stays
up, for example someone describing hate they encountered to raise
awareness of the problem.
a. Is Facebook's artificial intelligence technology capable of
automatically flagging fake profiles?
Answer. Claiming to be another person violates our Community
Standards, and we want to make it harder for anyone to be impersonated
on our platform. Users can also report accounts that are impersonating
them. We've developed several techniques to help detect and block this
type of abuse. At the time someone receives a friend request, our
systems are designed to check whether the recipient already has a
friend with the same name, along with a variety of other factors that
help us determine if an interaction is legitimate. Further, we recently
announced new features that use face recognition technology that may
help detect when someone is using another user's image as their profile
photo--which helps stop impersonation. This is an area we're
continually working to improve so that we can provide a safe and secure
experience on Facebook.
b. Is there currently any automated system in place for flagging
fake profiles or fake news articles at Facebook?
Answer. We block millions of fake account attempts each day as
people try to create them thanks to improvements in machine learning
and artificial intelligence. We are also working hard to stop the
spread of false news. To reduce the spread of false news, we remove
fake accounts and disrupt economic incentives for traffickers of
misinformation. We also use various signals, including feedback from
our community, to identify potential false news. In countries where we
have partnerships with independent third-party fact-checkers, stories
rated as false by those fact-checkers are shown lower in News Feed. If
Pages or domains repeatedly create or share misinformation, we
significantly reduce their distribution and remove their advertising
rights.
c. If yes, do Facebook employees review every such potentially fake
profile or news article that these systems flag?
Answer. Not every fake account that has been disabled is reviewed
as the volume is simply too great (Facebook took action on
approximately 583 million fake accounts in the first three months of
2018). But our engineers carefully test and retest the accuracy of the
policies and rules they implement to identify and disable fake
accounts.
d. Do Facebook employees manually search for fake content, or is
the function of flagging fake or inappropriate content left solely to
users and automated systems?
Answer. See Response to previous question (Question 20, part c).
Question 21. Special Counsel Robert Mueller's indictment of 13
Russian individuals and three Russian companies states that the
Russians have engaged in `` `information warfare against the United
States of America' through fictitious U.S. personas on social media
platforms,'' including Facebook. As a U.S. company, do you have an
obligation to prevent your platform from being used as a weapon against
our democracy?
a. What are you doing to prevent Facebook from being used for
information warfare in the 2018 election and beyond?
Answer. In the run-up to the 2016 elections, we were focused on the
kinds of cybersecurity attacks typically used by nation states, for
example phishing and malware attacks. And we were too slow to spot this
type of information operations interference. Since then, we've made
important changes to prevent bad actors from using misinformation to
undermine the democratic process.
This will never be a solved problem because we're up against
determined, creative, and well-funded adversaries. But we are making
steady progress. Here is a list of the 10 most important changes we
have made:
1. Ads transparency. Advertising should be transparent: users
should be able to see all the ads an advertiser is currently
running on Facebook, Instagram and Messenger. And for ads with
political content, we've created an archive that will hold ads
with political content for seven years--including information
about ad impressions and spend, as well as demographic data
such as age, gender, and location. People in Canada and Ireland
can already see all the ads that a Page is running on
Facebook--and we're launching this globally in June.
2. Verification and labeling. Every advertiser will now need
confirm their ID and location before being able to run any ads
with political content in the U.S. All ads with political
content will also clearly state who paid for them.
3. Updating targeting. We want ads on Facebook to be safe and
civil. We thoroughly review the targeting criteria advertisers
can use to ensure they are consistent with our principles. As a
result, we removed nearly one-third of the targeting segments
used by the IRA. We continue to allow some criteria that people
may find controversial. But we do see businesses marketing
things like historical books, documentaries or television shows
using them in legitimate ways.
4. Better technology. Over the past year, we've gotten
increasingly better at finding and disabling fake accounts. We
now block millions of fake accounts each day as people try to
create them--and before they've done any harm. This is thanks
to improvements in machine learning and artificial
intelligence, which can proactively identify suspicious
behavior at a scale that was not possible before--without
needing to look at the content itself.
5. Action to tackle fake news. We block millions of fake
account attempts each day as people try to create them thanks
to improvements in machine learning and artificial
intelligence. We are also working hard to stop the spread of
false news. To reduce the spread of false news, we remove fake
accounts and disrupt economic incentives for traffickers of
misinformation. We also use various signals, including feedback
from our community, to identify potential false news. In
countries where we have partnerships with independent third-
party fact-checkers, stories rated as false by those fact-
checkers are shown lower in News Feed. If Pages or domains
repeatedly create or share misinformation, we significantly
reduce their distribution and remove their advertising rights.
6. Significant investments in security. We're doubling the
number of people working on safety and security from 10,000
last year to over 20,000 this year. We expect these investments
to impact our profitability. But the safety of people using
Facebook needs to come before profit.
7. Industry collaboration. Recently, we joined 34 global tech
and security companies in signing a TechAccord pact to help
improve security for everyone.
8. Information sharing and reporting channels. In the 2017
German elections, we worked closely with the authorities there,
including the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI).
This gave them a dedicated reporting channel for security
issues related to the Federal elections.
9. Tracking 40+ elections. In recent months, we've started to
deploy new tools and teams to proactively identify threats in
the run-up to specific elections. We first tested this effort
during the Alabama Senate election, and plan to continue these
efforts for elections around the globe, including the U.S.
midterms. Last year we used public service announcements to
help inform people about fake news in 21 separate countries,
including in advance of French, Kenyan and German elections.
10. Action against the Russia-based IRA. In April, we removed
70 Facebook and 65 Instagram accounts--as well as 138 Facebook
Pages--controlled by the IRA primarily targeted either at
people living in Russia or Russian-speakers around the world
including from neighboring countries like Azerbaijan,
Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. The IRA has repeatedly used complex
networks of inauthentic accounts to deceive and manipulate
people in the U.S., Europe and Russia--and we don't want them
on Facebook anywhere in the world.
We are taking steps to enhance trust in the authenticity of
activity on our platform, including increasing ads transparency,
implementing a more robust ads review process, imposing tighter content
restrictions, and exploring how to add additional authenticity
safeguards.
b. Have you made any attempt to identify Russian political
advertisements or troll accounts that are not associated with the
Internet Research Agency?
Answer. Facebook has conducted a broad search for evidence that
Russian actors, not limited to the IRA or any other specific entity or
organization, attempted to interfere in the 2016 election by using
Facebook's advertising tools. We found coordinated activity that we now
attribute to the IRA, despite efforts by these accounts to mask the
provenance of their activity. We have used the best tools and
analytical techniques that are available to us to identify the full
extent of this malicious activity, and we continue to monitor our
platform for abuse and to share and receive information from others in
our industry about these threats.
Question 22. Do you have the technology or capability to detect
when a foreign entity is attempting to buy a political ad?
Answer. Now all election and issue ads on Facebook and Instagram in
the U.S. must be clearly labeled--including a ``Paid for by''
disclosure from the advertiser at the top of the ad. This will help
ensure that people can see who is paying for the ad--which is
especially important when the Page name doesn't match the name of the
company or person funding the ad. This also meets the commitments we
made back in October 2017 to increase the transparency of the election-
related ads people see on Facebook.
When people see that label, it means the person running the ad went
through the authorization process and verified his or her identity and
location. We believe this new level of transparency is good for people,
and it will allow journalists, researchers, NGOs and others to hold
campaigns, candidates and organizations accountable for the ads they
create. And all people on Facebook, no matter where they live, will
also be able to access and review a searchable archive that will house
these ads for seven years from the day they run. More information about
our transparency efforts can be found at our recent Newsroom posthere:
https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/05/hard-questions-political-ads.
Moreover, Facebook's Statement of Rights and Responsibilities (the
terms that govern all use of our services) prohibit using Facebook to
do anything that is unlawful, misleading, or malicious. In addition,
advertisers must comply with Facebook's Advertising Policies, including
acknowledging that they are responsible for understanding and complying
with all applicable laws and regulations. Therefore, violating the
Federal Election Campaign Act also violates our terms.
We also have processes designed to identify inauthentic and
suspicious activity and we also maintain a sanctions compliance program
to screen advertisers and paid app developers. Facebook's denied party
screening protocol involves checking paid app developers and
advertisers against applicable denied party listings. Those screened
remain in an on-going monitoring portfolio and are screened against
changes to applicable denied party listings. Moreover, our payments
subsidiaries file Suspicious Activity Reports on developers of certain
apps as appropriate. However, like other offline and online companies,
Facebook has limited insight into the use of shell corporations or
other sophisticated structures that may disguise the true buyer. In
addition, the general challenge of attributing online activities to
specific governments or organizations is widely recognized in the
intelligence and law enforcement communities.
a. If so, do you have any procedures to inform U.S. enforcement
agencies when a foreign entity is attempting to buy a political ad or
when it may be taking other steps to interfere in an election?
Answer. In general, we have a long history of working successfully
with the DOJ, the FBI, and other law enforcement to address a wide
variety of threats to our platform. We deeply respect and value the
seriousness, diligence, and support of those organizations, and we
would welcome their partnership as we work to address this specific
threat. We are particularly encouraged by the FBI's creation of a task
force dedicated to addressing election interference and we are actively
working with that newly-formed body. This is a new kind of threat, and
we believe that we will need to work together--across industry and
between industry and government--to be successful.
b. What trends have you discovered with respect to the rate at
which foreign entities are attempting to interfere in our elections? Is
this tactic becoming more prevalent over time?
Answer. See Response to Question 21, part b.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Mazie Hirono to
Mark Zuckerberg
Collection of Personal Data of Non-Facebook Users
Question 1. We asked you many questions at our hearing about what
rights Facebook users have or should have to know what personal data of
theirs Facebook has, to know who their data is shared with, and to have
effective control over the use of their personal data. At a hearing the
next day in the House of Representatives, you testified that Facebook
also collects ``data of people who have not signed up for Facebook.''
These are people who are not on Facebook and have had no ability to opt
in or out of sharing their personal data. In many if not most
instances, they may not know that Facebook has collected this data.
In response to criticism of this revelation, Facebook told the
press that it has no plans to build a tool that would disclose to non-
users that their data had been collected. Facebook's statement stated
that ``[t]his kind of data collection is fundamental to how the
Internet works,'' and ``standard to how the Internet works'' and
suggested that people use ``browser or device settings to delete
cookies,'' which are one of the ways in which Facebook and others track
people on the internet.
I have serious concerns that this answer is incomplete and
dismissive of the concerns. You said at the House hearing that this
kind of 3rd-party data collection was done for ``security purposes.''
But that answer also seems incomplete and not consistent with
Facebook's later statement that this is ``standard to how the Internet
works.'' Let me give you an opportunity to clarify.
a. Why do you collect this third party personal data from non-
Facebook users?
b. How do you collect this third party personal data from non-
Facebook users? Please be specific, including whether and how you use
``cookies'' and other hidden trackers.
c. How do you use the personal data you collect from non-Facebook
users? What do you use it to measure or analyze?
d. Do you use the personal data of non-Facebook users to target
ads? If so, how is that consistent with your testimony at the hearing
that such data is collected for ``security purposes''?
e. Does collecting cookies from any websites with Facebook ``like''
buttons or otherwise tracking the data of non-Facebook users serve any
``security purposes''? If so, how? If not, why did you testify that the
collection of such date was for ``security purposes''?
f. How do you store personal data you collect from non-Facebook
users? Do you ever delete this data?
Answer. When people visit apps or websites that feature our
technologies--like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers
automatically log (i) standard browser or app records of the fact that
a particular device or user visited the website or app (this connection
to Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a
website or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button,
and is an inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any
additional information the publisher of the app or website chooses to
share with Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as
the fact that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard
feature of the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same
information with multiple different third-parties whenever people visit
their website or app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's
website shares information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick
and with the analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a
person visits the Committee's website, it sends browser information
about their visit to each one of those third parties. More information
about how this works is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/
04/data-off-facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for this
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us--
described above--in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First,
these logs are critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to
detecting or preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser
has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign
the device might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a
potentially inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to
register for an account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide
summaries and insights to websites and apps about how many people visit
or use their product, or use specific features like our Like button--
but without providing any information about a specific person. We do
not create profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use browser and
app logs for non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from our
advertisers to them or otherwise seek to personalize the content they
see. However, we may take the opportunity to show a general ad that is
unrelated to the attributes of the person or an ad encouraging the non-
user to sign up for Facebook.
Question 2. According to the Princeton Web Transparency &
Accountability Project (WebTAP), Facebook trackers are used on about 25
percent of the top million websites. Gabriel Weinberg, CEO and Founder
of DuckDuckGo, an Internet privacy company, wrote recently on
FastCompany.com that Facebook uses these trackers to create ``shadow
profiles'' even of non-Facebook users based on their browsing history.
However, Facebook said in a press statement that it does not create
databases on non-users by combining web-browsing history with uploaded
contacts.
a. Can you confirm that you do not create such databases of non-
users or clarify in what ways you collect and use the personal data of
non-users that you collect?
b. Can you specify whether you use tracking of non-Facebook users'
personal data to create ``shadow profiles'' of them and/or any other
type of profile of them and, if so, how are these profiles used?
c. Do you believe that Americans who use the Internet have a right
to know they are being tracked and profiled by Facebook and other
companies like Google? Do you believe American have the right to have
access to the contents of those profiles?
d. Given that non-users of Facebook have not had the opportunity to
consent at all to Facebook's collection of their data, let alone its
use, do you believe they should be given the opportunity to ``opt in''
before their personal data is tracked and captured?
Answer. Facebook does not create profiles or track website visits
for people without a Facebook account. See response to Question 1 for
more detail.
Adopting the EU's Model for Personal Data Protection
Question 3. On May 25, just a few weeks from now, the European
Union will put into effect its new General Data Protection Regulation,
or GDPR. Under that system, the concept of ownership over personal data
is almost completely upside down from what we have in America. In
Europe, where data protection is a fundamental right, consent to use
that information can only be given if it is clear, affirmative and
unambiguous. Owners of data may withdraw their consent at any time, and
companies and organizations must notify the EU of serious data breaches
as soon as possible, and not wait years, as happens here.
The week before our hearing, you told reporters that you intend to
make the same controls and settings required under the GDPR everywhere.
However, when you were asked about applying these new regulations in
the U.S., you were much more vague, committing only that applying these
European regulations here in the U.S. is ``worth discussing.'' I want
to start having that discussion now.
a. Will you commit to making the setting and controls required by
GDPR available everywhere, including in America? If not, why not, and
what privacy controls and settings will you make available here?
Answer. The controls and settings that Facebook is enabling as part
of GDPR are available to people around the world, including settings
for controlling our use of face recognition on Facebook and for
controlling our ability to use data we collect off Facebook Company
Products to target ads. We recently began providing direct notice of
these controls and our updated terms to people around the world
(including in the U.S.), allowing people to choose whether or not to
enable or disable these settings or to consent to our updated terms. We
provide the same tools for access, rectification, erasure, data
portability, and others to people in the U.S. and the rest of world
that we provide in Europe, and many of those tools (like our Download
Your Information tool, ad preferences tool, and Activity Log) have been
available globally for many years.
b. Will users in this country have the right to data portability,
where they will be able to transfer their personal data from Facebook
if they choose?
Answer. See Response to Question 3(a).
c. At the hearing many Senators discussed with you the need for
Facebook users to be notified promptly when their data has been hacked.
You told Senator Klobuchar you though 72 hours for notification ``makes
sense to [you].'' Can you commit to a 72 hour timeline for
notification?
Answer. One of the challenges with notification in the United
States is that there is no Federal breach notification law, which means
that notification technically requires reaching out to 50 different
state regulators under a patchwork of different frameworks. While we
would support a short time period for notification in the United
States, this would need to be part of a centrally managed Federal
scheme that would make this process efficient and manageable. In
Europe, for example, we are required to notify our lead supervisory
authority--the Irish Data Protection Commissioner--within 72 hours of a
data breach that poses a risk to the rights and freedoms of data
subjects, not every single Member State's data protection authority.
Moreover, the GDPR only requires notification to people in cases where
there is a high risk of harm to an individual resulting from the breach
and where the data controller is unable to mitigate that harm through
subsequent measures that prevent continued access to the data, etc.
GDPR thus creates incentives for companies to work with a lead
regulator and to mitigate harm to people, reserving notification to
people for cases where there is no other means to avoid a high risk of
harm to people. This reflects a responsible and thoughtful evaluation
of the potential risks to people resulting from public notification,
which would have the effect of publicizing a breach that could then be
exploited by bad actors (who might not otherwise know about it). The
regulatory notification requirement ensures there is appropriate
oversight in a specific situation.
d. Will you treat what Article 9 of the GDPR calls ``Special
Categories'' of personal data, such as data revealing, among other
things, racial or ethnic origin, religious beliefs, and genetic data,
according to the strict EU standards?
Answer. We are prompting people in Europe and in the United States
to go through an engagement flow that educates them about data they
have shared on their profiles that constitutes ``special categories of
personal data'' under GDPR (such as information they choose to include
in their profile like religious and political views). This experience
gives people--including both people in Europe and people in the U.S.--
the ability to delete this information from their profile through in-
line controls.
e. Will Facebook users who gave consent to share their data be able
to withdraw that consent at any time?
Answer. Yes, by visiting Facebook Settings. For sharing of specific
pieces of information, such as a Facebook post or a field in a person's
Facebook profile, people also have the ability to delete this
information or change the audience who is eligible to see it.
f. Would Facebook's collection of the personal data of non-users be
permissible under these GDPR regulations, which require affirmative
notice and consent?
Answer. GDPR does not require consent for most uses of personal
information, and instead, recognizes that many uses of data are
necessary to provide a service or within a company's legitimate
interests or the public interest, etc. We agree that different levels
of consent or notice are appropriate depending on the type of
information or contemplated use at issue. The GDPR does not
differentiate between users and non-users, and indeed, many online or
digital services around the world do not require registration or
distinguish between ``users'' and ``non-users'' before collecting or
logging data, such as browser logs of people who visit their website.
g. Considering that these regulations go into effect in less than a
month, can you produce to the Committee the language that European
users of Facebook will be presented with on May 25?
Answer. Yes, here are screenshots of the consent flows being
provided in Europe:

Discriminatory Targeting of Facebook Ads
Question 4. I asked you several questions about whether Facebook is
following its own stated policy of forbidding Facebook ads that
excluded audiences for the ads on the basis of race, gender, family
status, sexual orientation, disability or veteran status. These are all
categories prohibited by Federal law in housing and employment law.
Yet, in October 2016, journalists at Pro Publica revealed that it was
possible to buy Facebook ads that excluded these audiences. Even though
Facebook announced in February 2017 that it would no longer allow such
ads, a year later Pro Publica found they could still place them. They
also found ads for employment that excluded age groups employers
weren't interested in targeting, also a violation of Federal law.
I appreciated your sincerity in telling me and other Senators that
it is ``against [Facebook] policies to have any ideas that are
discriminatory.'' I also appreciate your candor, after describing the
need for more active screening, in admitting that policing
discriminatory targeting is ``a work in progress.'' I want to ask you
about the path forward in enforcing your policy, and your assessment of
Facebook's capacity to handle these problems and the legal concerns
they raise without outside enforcement.
a. At the hearing you cited your anti-discrimination policy. Yet,
it has been well over a year since Facebook announced it would no
longer allow ads that used discriminatory, and in some cases illegal,
targeting and you admit that you still need to develop better tools.
How do you measure and assess that you efforts to enforce your own
anti-discrimination policies are working?
b. The story from Pro Publica suggests little if any progress has
been made, even though during the whole period of time your policy
against discrimination was your policy, and you explicitly banned the
purchase of ad engaging in discriminatory targeting over a year ago.
Recognizing this is a ``work in progress,'' what does improvement look
like to you? What does complying with your policy look like to you?
c. What accountability is there for failure to comply with your
policy against discriminatory targeting?
d. In addition to your existing screening of ads and flags raised
by the community that you follow-up on with your team, you suggested
that Facebook needs ``to develop more AI tools that can more
proactively identify those types of content and do that kind of
filtering up front.'' What are your plans for developing and timeline
for deploying these tools, and when do you expect to see a measurable
progress the elimination of discriminatory targeting?
e. Is there a way for the public to verify that you have made
progress or are we just expected to trust you?
Answer. Our Terms and Advertising Policies have long emphasized our
prohibition on the use of Facebook's platform to engage in wrongful
discrimination. Starting in late 2016, we began implementing additional
protections for the people who use Facebook. Specifically, we set out
to help better educate advertisers about our policies against
discrimination and relevant Federal and state laws, and to help prevent
the abuse of our tools. First, we updated our Advertising Policies
applicable to all advertisers and advertisements to strengthen our
prohibition against discrimination, and we added a section to provide
advertisers with anti-discrimination educational resources from
government agencies and civil rights groups. Second, we implemented
technical measures aimed at better protecting users from wrongful
discrimination by advertisers that offer housing, employment and credit
opportunities. We continue to work to improve these measures.
We are continuing to evaluate the targeting options we make
available to advertisers. This work involves consultation with key
stakeholders outside the company, including with policymakers,
regulators, civil rights experts, and consumer advocates. The decision
to remove targeting options is not something we take lightly: as many
of these stakeholders have pointed out, targeting is a key mechanism
for forging meaningful connections between people and organizations on
Facebook.
One recent example illustrates the challenge of getting this work
right. Earlier this year, we eliminated the ability to target people
based on the ``interested in'' field that people can add to their
Facebook profiles. People can indicate that they are interested in men,
women, or both, and some consider the field to be a place where people
can indicate their sexual orientation. After receiving feedback from a
range of stakeholders, we eliminated the ability to target based on
this field. Although some groups applauded the decision, others
criticized it, noting that it would now be harder to reach certain
groups.
We also are working to provide more in-product education about
advertisers' obligations under our non-discrimination policy, and
anticipate that this education will be more detailed and will be
presented to a broader range of advertisers than our current education.
Finally, we will soon launch View Ads, a feature that will enable
anyone to see all of the ads an advertiser is currently running by
visiting the advertiser's Facebook Page. This level of transparency is
unprecedented among advertising platforms, and we believe it will
further our efforts to combat discrimination by giving people the
opportunity to see ads regardless of whether they are in the target
audience.
We have focused on measures that are designed to prevent
advertisers from misusing our tools to place discriminatory housing,
credit and employment ads, including: requiring such advertisers to
certify their compliance with our Advertising Policies and with
relevant anti-discrimination laws and prophylactically removing
advertisers' ability to use certain categories of information to target
their audience. Some of these measures are proactive, such as the
classifiers we use to detect when an advertiser is attempting to run a
housing, credit, or employment ad. Facebook rejects ads from
advertisers who do not certify compliance. We also recently launched
automated tools to proactively identify racist or offensive content and
hate speech in ads.
In addition, Facebook conducts an automated review of ads to ensure
that they do not assert or imply personal attributes in violation of
our Advertising Policies. Ads that violate this policy are rejected.
Advertisers can appeal these rejections. Understanding that we might
not be able to prevent every misuse of our ad tools, we encourage users
to report offensive ads to Facebook. Ads that violate our Advertising
Policies are removed when we become aware of them. We also anticipate
that the View Ads tool--which, as described above, will allow people to
see all the ads an advertiser is currently running--will encourage
people to report more ads to us, and will therefore enhance our efforts
to curtail misuse of our tools.
Consumer Protection for Facebook Users
Question 5. American consumers rightfully expect that they can take
part in the market for goods and services while being protected from
certain kinds of harm. The government makes sure that our food and
drugs aren't tainted. We have laws that make sure advertising in print
or on TV and radio doesn't contain lies. We demand transparency and
honesty from banks and stock brokers.
Yet, for Americans using Facebook, there is almost a total lack of
these kinds of protections. And when Americans suffer harm, there is no
accountability for Facebook. We are expected to hand over our most
vital personal information with no control over how it is used or
misused, and we are told this is the cost of ``connection'' and of
being part of the Facebook ``community''. I know that since some of the
worst breaches of trust were discovered you've been talking about the
steps you are taking to do better.
a. Why should we leave it up to you to protect America's Facebook
consumers?
b. Do you think they are any less deserving of their government's
protection than milk drinkers or detergent buyers or home buyers
seeking a mortgage? What makes your business different?
Answer. Facebook is generally not opposed to regulation but wants
to ensure it is the right regulation. We are already regulated in many
ways--for example, under the Federal Trade Commission Act--and we are
subject to ongoing oversight by the FTC under the terms of a 2011
consent order. Facebook has inherent incentives to protect its
customers' privacy and address breaches and vulnerabilities. Indeed,
the recent discovery of misconduct by an app developer on the Facebook
platform clearly hurt Facebook and made it harder for us to achieve our
social mission. As such, Facebook is committed to protecting our
platform from bad actors, ensuring we are able to continue our mission
of giving people a voice and bringing them closer together. We are also
actively building new technologies to help prevent abuse on our
platform, including advanced AI tools to monitor and remove fake
accounts. We have also significantly increased our investment in
security, employing more than 15,000 individuals working solely on
security and content review and planning to increase that number to
over 20,000 by the end of the year. We have also strengthened our
advertising policies, seeking to prevent discrimination while improving
transparency.
Question 6. When users sign up for services on Facebook, they are
asked for consent to use their personal data in certain ways. But it's
typically in the form of pages of small print that pop up on the screen
that few people bother to read. And as these terms of services change
over time or as users sign up for new services, they are asked to click
a box next to yet more pages of small print. The Pew Research Center
tells us that about 52 percent of Internet users believe that ``when a
company posts a privacy policy, it ensures that the company keeps
confidential all the information it collects on users.''
Do you believe this is a reasonable expectation of people who sign
up to use Facebook? Should it be?
Answer. We believe that it's important to communicate with people
about the information that we collect and how people can control it.
This is why we work hard to provide this information to people in a
variety of ways: in our Data Policy, and in Privacy Basics, which
provides walkthroughs of the most common privacy questions we receive.
Beyond simply disclosing our practices, we also think it's important to
give people access to their own information, which we do through our
Download Your Information and Access Your Information tools, Activity
Log, and Ad Preferences, all of which are accessible through our
Privacy Shortcuts tool. We also provide information about these topics
as people are using the Facebook service itself.
Facebook seeks, as much as possible, to put controls and
information in context within its service. While ``up front''
information like that contained in the terms of service are useful,
research overwhelmingly demonstrates that in-product controls and
education are the most meaningful to people and the most likely to be
read and understood. On-demand controls are also important, and we
recently redesigned our entire settings menu on mobile devices from top
to bottom to make things easier to find. We also created a new Privacy
Shortcuts menu where people can control their data in just a few taps,
with clearer explanations of how our controls work. The experience is
now clearer, more visual, and easy to find.
Improving people's understanding of how digital services work is an
industry-wide challenge that we are highly committed to addressing.
That's why, over the last 18 months, we've run a global series of
design workshops called ``Design Jams,'' bringing together experts in
design, privacy, law and computer science to work collaboratively on
new and innovative approaches. These workshops have run in Paris,
London, Dublin, Berlin, Sao Paolo, Hong Kong, and other cities, and
included global regulators and policymakers. At these workshops, expert
teams use ``people centric design'' methods to create innovative new
design prototypes and experiences to improve transparency and education
in digital services. These workshops inform Facebook's constantly-
improving approach.
In recognition of the need for improved approaches to data
transparency across all digital services, working with partners from
academia, design, and industry we recently launched TTC Labs, a design
innovation lab that seeks to improve user experiences around personal
data. TTC Labs is an open platform for sharing and innovation and
contains insights from leading experts in academia, design, and law, in
addition to prototype designs from the Design Jams, template services
and open-source toolkits for people-centric design for transparency,
trust, and control of data. Working collaboratively, and based on open-
source approaches, TTC Labs seeks to pioneer new and more people-
centric best practices for people to understand how their data is used
by digital services, in ways that they find easy to understand and
control.
Facebook is highly committed to improving people's experience of
its own services as well as investing in new innovations and approaches
to support improvements across the industry.
Advertising Revenue Model and Facebook's Mission
Question 7. At the hearing and in recent interviews you have
defended Facebook's approach to generating advertising revenue by
targeting ads towards users. You proudly said that a model based on
adverting is the only rational way to make Facebook accessible to all
people. In response to Apple CEO Tim Cook saying he wouldn't have
gotten himself into a situation like the one you and Facebook find
yourselves in, you talked a lot about ways that Facebook shows it cares
about its users. You defended your model as the best way to connect
everyone.
a. But is an advertising based model really the only way to make
Facebook accessible to all people, or is it the only way to do so while
making massive profits?
Answer. Like many other free online services, we sell advertising
space to third parties. Doing so enables us to offer our services to
consumers for free. This is part of our mission to give people the
power to build community and bring the world closer together. To build
a secure product with extensive infrastructure that connects people
across continents and culture, we need to make sure everyone can afford
it. Advertising lets us keep Facebook free, which ensures it remains
affordable for everyone.
Separately, our core service involves personalizing all content,
features, and recommendations that people see on Facebook services. No
two people have the same experience on Facebook or Instagram, and they
come to our services because they expect everything they see to be
relevant to them. If we were not able to personalize or select ads or
other content based on relevance, this would fundamentally change the
service we offer on Facebook--and it would no longer be Facebook.
We maintain our commitment to privacy by not telling advertisers
who users are or selling people's information to anyone. That has
always been true. We think relevant advertising and privacy are not in
conflict, and we're committed to doing both well.
b. Isn't there a better way that balances the making of profits
with stronger privacy protections, and shouldn't it be our role in
Congress to make sure we are keeping that balance?
Answer. Privacy is at the core of everything we do, and our
approach to privacy starts with our commitment to transparency and
control--to helping people understand how their data is collected and
used, and to giving them meaningful controls.
Question 8. Facebook's stated mission is ``to give people the power
to build community and bring the world closer together.''
a. How is this mission consistent with your business model of
finding ways to extract value from the personal data of users?
Answer. See Response to Question 7(a).
b. Doesn't the gross misuse of users' data without their consent to
better target them with fake news undermine this mission by devaluing
and dividing the community?
Answer. We believe targeted advertising creates value for people
and advertisers who use Facebook. Being able to target ads to the
people most likely to be interested in the products, service or causes
being advertised enables businesses and other organizations to run
effective campaigns at reasonable prices. This efficiency has
particularly benefited small businesses, which make up the vast
majority of the six million active advertisers on Facebook. That said,
we are keenly aware of the concerns about the potential of our tools to
be abused. That is why we are investing heavily in improving the
security and integrity of our platform.
c. What happens the next time you have a business reason to again
compromise the personal data of users, or at least look the other way?
Answer. We do not have a ``business reason'' to compromise the
personal data of users; we have a business reason to protect that
information. Our mission is to build community and bring the world
closer together, but it is not enough to just connect people--we have
to make sure those connections are positive. If people's experiences
are not positive--if we fail to maintain their trust--they will not use
our services.
Irish Elections
Question 9. On May 25, 2018, there will be a referendum conducted
in Ireland to determine whether there will be changes in abortion laws.
Is Facebook willing to implement full transparency of political ads
that they have accepted have targeted Irish voters, together with any
information they hold on the person or organizations who paid to
promote the content?
Answer. As of April 25, we added Ireland to our pilot program for
the first phase of our transparency efforts--the View Ads tool. This
has enabled Irish Facebook users to see all of the ads every page is
running on Facebook targeting users in Ireland at the same time. We
also announced on May 8 that we would begin rejecting ads related to
the referendum if run by advertisers based outside of Ireland.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Cory Booker to
Mark Zuckerberg
Question 1. In 2016, ProPublica revealed that advertisers could use
``ethnic affinity'' marketing categories to potentially discriminate
against Facebook users in the areas of housing, employment, and credit,
in violation of Federal law. While you committed in November 2016 to
``build tools to detect and automatically disable the use of ethnic-
affinity marketing for certain types of ads,'' a year later ProPublica
found that the system you built was still letting housing ads through
without applying the new restrictions. It was chalked up to a
``technical failure.'' You then opted for system where advertisers
self-certify that they are complying with Federal law and Facebook's
antidiscrimination policy, but in fact just last month, several fair
housing organizations filed a lawsuit against Facebook in the S.D.N.Y.
alleging discrimination in housing advertising based not just on race,
but also on disability, gender, and familial status. According to the
lawsuit, the most recent ad buys were still occurring just weeks ago in
late February 2018.
a. Is a self-certification model the strongest way to safeguard
against discrimination?
Answer. Our Terms and Advertising Policies have long emphasized our
prohibition on the use of Facebook's platform to engage in wrongful
discrimination. Starting in late 2016, we began implementing additional
protections for the people who use Facebook. Specifically, we set out
to help better educate advertisers about our policies against
discrimination and relevant Federal and state laws, and to help prevent
the abuse of our tools. First, we updated our Advertising Policies
applicable to all advertisers and advertisements to strengthen our
prohibition against discrimination, and we added a section to provide
advertisers with antidiscrimination educational resources from
government agencies and civil rights groups. Second, we implemented
technical measures aimed at better protecting users from wrongful
discrimination by advertisers that offer housing, employment and credit
opportunities. Specifically, when we identify one of these types of
ads, we require the advertiser to certify that it is complying with our
anti-discrimination policy and with applicable law. We reject thousands
of ads a day where the advertiser fails to certify.
b. Would it be better to not serve ads in certain categories
(housing/credit/employment) at all?
Answer. We have heard concerns about third party advertisers
misusing these tools to engage in wrongful discrimination with respect
to ads for housing, credit, and employment by targeting people based on
the protected characteristics outlined in your questions. Based on
feedback we have received from our community, and from policymakers,
regulators, civil rights experts, and consumer advocates, we have
limited the targeting options we offer for such advertisements that
relate to protected classes as follows:
We do not offer targeting based on race, religion,
disability, sexual orientation, or gender identity.
We do not offer targeting based on national origin, but we
do have segments composed of ``ex-pats''--people who used to
live in particular countries (and may or may not be from these
countries originally).
We do permit some targeting based on family status (e.g.,
people who are parents), but we generally do not permit
advertisers to exclude people from their audiences based on
family status. Please note, however, that in limited cases and
for the purpose of running ads that are not related to housing,
employment or credit, we are re-enabling the ability of
advertisers to exclude people from their audiences based on
family status but are reviewing this as a targeting option.
Like other major ad platforms, we enable targeting based on
age and gender.
We offer targeting options--called ``interests'' and
``behaviors''--that are based on people's activities on
Facebook, and when, where and how they connect to the Internet
(such as the kind of device they use and their mobile carrier).
These options do not reflect people's personal characteristics,
but we still take precautions to limit the potential for
advertisers to misuse them. For example, we do not create
interest or behavior segments that suggest the people in the
segment are members of sensitive groups such as particular
races, ethnicities, or religions. We therefore would not create
an interest segment called ``Muslims,'' because it could be
misunderstood to enable an advertiser to reach people based on
their religious beliefs.
We also offer what we call the multicultural affinity
segments, which are groups of people whose activities on
Facebook suggest they may be interested in content related to
the African American, Asian American, or Hispanic American
communities. (For example, if a person ``likes'' Facebook Pages
with the words ``African American'' in them or likes Pages for
Historically Black Colleges and Universities, that person may
be included in the African American multicultural segment.) As
we explain to advertisers in our tools, these segments are
based on people's activities on Facebook, not on race or
ethnicity (which categories Facebook does not enable people to
even include on their profiles).
We have gone even further when it comes to using the
``exclude'' feature in our ads tools. This feature is designed
to help advertisers refine their audiences by, for example,
excluding people who are already interested in their products.
But we recognize that permitting exclusions could, in some
circumstances, raise the risk that an advertiser would engage
in wrongful discrimination. For that reason, many of the
targeting audiences that advertisers can choose to include in
the group eligible to see their ad are not available for
exclusion. For example, while we believe it is important that
organizations be able to affirmatively reach people in the
multicultural affinity segments, advertisers are not able to
exclude people from their audiences based on the multicultural
affinity segments.
We also recently added a notice below the ``exclude'' field
that reminds advertisers of their obligations under our non-
discrimination policy as well as under relevant applicable law
in a persistent manner when they create their advertisements
and define their audiences.
In early 2017, we launched machine learning tools (called
``classifiers'') that were intended to automatically identify,
once an ad was entered into our systems, employment, credit,
and housing ads. We built these classifiers so that when one of
these kinds of ads was identified, we could take two actions
that would make it harder for advertisers to misuse our tools.
c. Given your inability to fix something as straightforward as
discriminatory housing ads, why should Congress trust Facebook's
ability to target and reduce suspicious election activity?
Answer. These industry-wide problems are not easy to solve, but we
are committed to doing better by implementing the steps outlined
throughout this document.
d. How does Facebook prevent advertisers from using their own data
to segment users by race or other protected categories using Facebook's
Custom Audiences feature?
Answer. See Response to Question 1, part c.
Question 2. In responding to a November 2016 class action lawsuit
against Facebook for discrimination in housing, employment, and credit,
Facebook moved to dismiss the complaint on the basis that the
plaintiffs were not injured.
a. Do you believe that people of color who are not recruited for
various economic opportunities are harmed by not hearing about those
opportunities?
Answer. We have Community Standards that prohibit hate speech,
bullying, intimidation, and other kinds of harmful behavior. We hold
advertisers to even stricter advertising policies to protect users from
things like discriminatory ads. We don't want advertising to be used
for hate or discrimination, and our policies reflect that. For example,
we make it clear that advertisers may not discriminate against people
based on personal attributes such as race, ethnicity, color, national
origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, family
status, disability, and medical or genetic condition. We educate
advertisers on our anti-discrimination policy, and in some cases--
including when we detect that an advertiser is running a housing ad--we
require advertisers to certify compliance with our anti-discrimination
policy and anti-discrimination laws.
Question 3. A 2016 investigation by the ACLU of California revealed
that another app developer, Geofeedia, was using data from Facebook and
other platforms to help law enforcement monitor the activities of
peacefully protesting civilians of color. In response, Facebook changed
its policy to prohibit any developers from facilitating the
surveillance of Facebook users.
a. You have endorsed Black Lives Matter and expressed sympathy
after Philando Castile's killing, which was broadcast on Facebook Live.
Despite this, why should communities of color trust Facebook has
sufficiently addressed this surveillance issue?
b. Is simply changing the language of your terms of service enough?
Have you taken any other steps to prevent another Geofeedia from
attempting something similar?
Answer. In March 2017, we added language to our Facebook and
Instagram platform policies to more clearly explain that developers
cannot use data obtained from us to provide tools that are used for
surveillance. Our previous policy limited developers' use of data but
did not explicitly mention surveillance. We found out that some
developers created and marketed tools meant for surveillance, took
action, and we clarified our policy.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Kamala Harris to
Mark Zuckerberg
Follow-up Questions Never Answered
At the hearing, I raised a series of questions for which you did
not have answers. Please respond to those questions, which include:
Question 1. Whether Facebook can track users' browsing activity
even after the user has logged off of Facebook?
Answer. When people visit apps or websites that feature our
technologies--like the Facebook Like or Comment button--our servers
automatically log (i) standard browser or app records of the fact that
a particular device or user visited the website or app (this connection
to Facebook's servers occurs automatically when a person visits a
website or app that contains our technologies, such as a Like button,
and is an inherent function of Internet design); and (ii) any
additional information the publisher of the app or website chooses to
share with Facebook about the person's activities on that site (such as
the fact that a purchase was made on the site). This is a standard
feature of the Internet, and most websites and apps share this same
information with multiple different third-parties whenever people visit
their website or app. For example, the Senate Commerce Committee's
website shares information with Google and its affiliate DoubleClick
and with the analytics company Webtrends. This means that, when a
person visits the Committee's website, it sends browser information
about their visit to each one of those third parties. More information
about how this works is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/
04/data-off-facebook/.
When the person visiting a website featuring Facebook's tools is
not a registered Facebook user, Facebook does not have information
identifying that individual, and it does not create profiles for this
individual.
We use the browser and app logs that apps and websites send to us--
described above--in the following ways for non-Facebook users. First,
these logs are critical to protecting the security of Facebook and to
detecting or preventing fake account access. For example, if a browser
has visited hundreds of sites in the last five minutes, that's a sign
the device might be a bot, which would be an important signal of a
potentially inauthentic account if that browser then attempted to
register for an account. Second, we aggregate those logs to provide
summaries and insights to websites and apps about how many people visit
or use their product, or use specific features like our Like button--
but without providing any information about a specific person. We do
not create profiles for non-Facebook users, nor do we use browser and
app logs for non-Facebook users to show targeted ads from our
advertisers to them or otherwise seek to personalize the content they
see. However, we may take the opportunity to show a general ad that is
unrelated to the attributes of the person or an ad encouraging the non-
user to sign up for Facebook.
When the individual is a Facebook user, we are also able to use
this information to personalize that individual's experiences on
Facebook, whether or not the individual is logged out, but we will not
target ads to users relying on this information unless they allow this
in their privacy settings. We do not sell or share this information
with third-parties.
Question 2. Whether Facebook can track your activity across devices
even when you are not logged into Facebook?
Answer. See Response to Question 1.
Question 3. Who are Facebook's biggest competitors?
Answer. In Silicon Valley and around the world, new social apps are
emerging all the time. The average American uses eight different apps
to communicate with their friends and stay in touch with people. There
is a lot of choice, innovation, and activity in this space, with new
competitors arising all the time. Facebook's top priority and core
service is to build useful and engaging products that enable people to
connect, discover, and share through mobile devices and personal
computers. Given its broad product offerings, Facebook faces numerous
competitors, competing to attract, engage, and retain users, to attract
and retain marketers, and to attract and retain developers who build
compelling mobile and web applications. For instance, if users want to
share a photo or video, they can choose between Facebook, DailyMotion,
Snapchat, YouTube, Flickr, Twitter, Vimeo, Google Photos, and
Pinterest, among many other services. Similarly, if people are looking
to message someone, just to name a few, there's Apple's iMessage,
Telegram, Skype, Line, Viber, WeChat, Snapchat, and LinkedIn--as well
as the traditional text messaging services their mobile phone carrier
provides. Equally, companies also have more options than ever when it
comes to advertising--from billboards, print, and broadcast, to newer
platforms like Facebook, Spotify, Twitter, Google, YouTube, Amazon, or
Snapchat. Facebook represents a small part (in fact, just 6 percent) of
this $650 billion global advertising ecosystem and much of that has
been achieved by helping small businesses--many of whom could never
have previously afforded newspaper or TV ads--to cost-effectively reach
a wider audience.
Question 4. Whether Facebook may store up to 96 categories of
users' information?
Answer. Your question likely references a Washington Post article
that purported to identify ``98 data points that Facebook uses to
target ads to you.'' The article was based on the writer's use of the
tool that allows advertisers to select the audience that they want to
see their ads. Anyone on Facebook can see the tool and browse the
different audiences that advertisers can select.
The ``data points'' to which the article refers are not categories
of information that we collect from everyone on Facebook. Rather, they
reflect audiences into which at least some people on Facebook fall,
based on the information they have provided and their activity. For
example, the article lists ``field of study'' and ``employer'' as two
of the ``data points'' that can be used to show ads to people. People
can choose to provide information about their field of study and their
employer in profile fields, and those who do may be eligible to see ads
based on that information--unless they have used the controls in Ad
Preferences that enable people to opt out of seeing ads based on that
information. The same is true of the other items in the list of 98.
Further, the specific number of categories that are used to decide
what ads a person will see vary from person to person, depending on the
interests and information that they have shared on Facebook, how
frequently they interact with ads and other content on Facebook, and
other factors. Any person can see each of the specific interests we
maintain about them for advertising by visiting Ads Preferences, which
lets people see what interests we use to choose ads for them--and to
edit or delete these interests. We also provide more detailed
information about how we use data to decide what ads to show to people
in our ``About Facebook Ads'' page, at https://www.facebook.com/ads/
about.
Please note, however, that (as the article explains) many of these
refer to ``Partner Categories''--audiences that are offered by third-
party data providers. We announced in April that we would stop offering
this kind of targeting later this year.
Question 5. Whether you knew Dr. Kogan's terms of service?
Answer. Facebook has developed an automated system for checking
that all apps had terms of service and data policies. In performing
such checks, however, Facebook does not examine the content of the
developers' terms and policies because app developers act as
independent third parties with regard to the data they obtain; they
determine the purposes for which, and the manner in which, that data is
processed. Our understanding is that this is consistent with the
practices of other online and mobile platforms, which generally enable
developers on their platforms to provide access to the developers'
terms and policies in their app stores, but do not proactively review
the substance of those policies.
Although developers act as independent third parties with regard to
the data users share with them, all apps on the Facebook Platform must
comply with our user data policies, Community Standards, Platform
Policies, and Ad Guidelines. Our Platform policy also contains a number
of enforcement provisions which apply after an app has been reviewed
and approved. Facebook has several teams dedicated to detecting,
escalating, investigating, and combating violations of its policies,
including schemes to improperly access, collect, or exploit user data.
The Developer Operations Policy Enforcement team looks for policy
violations and either brings developers into compliance or removes them
from the platform, and the Developer Operations Review team conducts an
upfront review of apps to confirm proper use of advanced permissions.
Question 6. Whether you knew that Dr. Kogan could sell or transfer
data?
Answer. Kogan was not permitted to sell or transfer data to third-
parties for the purposes he did. In doing so, Kogan and his company
violated Facebook's Platform Policies, which explicitly prohibit
selling or licensing user data accessed from Facebook and from sharing
any user data accessed from Facebook with any ad network, data broker,
or other advertising or monetization-related service.
Scope of Data Collection
The core of Facebook's business model is the commodification of
personal user data. This data culling and packaging is a complex
endeavor, but the crux of it is simple--Facebook collects user data,
categorizes it into demographic buckets, and works with advertising
companies to target ads.
There are two realms of data collection--user-generated data (e.g.
data input by the user such as name, gender, etc.) and platform-
generated data (e.g. IP addresses, searches, and likes).
Question 1. Please answer, for the record, the following with a
simple yes or no response. Does Facebook collect and permanently store:
a. Usernames?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects a user's Facebook URL (e.g.,
username or vanity for your account). Users can view the vanity URL in
their Timeline URL. They can change their usernames via Settings.
b. Reported gender?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects information regarding the gender a
user added to the About section of their Timeline.
c. Reported address?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects information regarding a user's
current address or any past addresses they chose to include on their
account.
d. Reported school affiliation?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects information regarding any
information a user added to Education field in the About section of
your Timeline. Users can download Education information, as well as
other information associated with their Facebook accounts, through our
Download Your Information tool. We also recently introduced Access Your
Information--a secure way for people to access and manage their
information, such as posts, reactions, comments, and things they've
searched for. Users can go here to delete anything from their timelines
or profiles that they no longer want on Facebook.
If someone adds this information to their profile, they can later
choose to delete it. If they do so, we will remove it from our site and
delete it in accordance with our Data Policy.
e. Reported employment?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects any current information a user has
added to Work in the About section of their Timeline. They can download
Work information, as well as other information associated with their
Facebook account, through our Download Your Information tool. We also
recently introduced Access Your Information--a secure way for people to
access and manage their information, such as posts, reactions,
comments, and things they've searched for. Users can go here to delete
anything from their timelines or profiles that they no longer want on
Facebook.
If someone adds this information to their profile, they can later
choose to delete it. If they do so, we will remove it from our site and
delete it in accordance with our Data Policy.
f. Reported political affiliation?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects any information a user added to
Political Views in the About section of Timeline. Users can download
Political Views information, as well as other information associated
with their Facebook accounts, through our Download Your Information
tool. We also recently introduced Access Your Information--a secure way
for people to access and manage their information, such as posts,
reactions, comments, and things they've searched for. Users can go here
to delete anything from their timelines or profiles that they no longer
want on Facebook.
If someone adds this information to their profile, they can later
choose to delete it. If they do so, we will remove it from our site and
delete it in accordance with our Data Policy.
We recently began to prompt people on Facebook who have added a
political affiliation to their profiles to review this information and
decide whether they want to keep it on their profiles. More information
about these prompts is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/
05/pardon-the-interruption/.
g. Every friend in a user's network?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects a list of a user's friends. Users
can download a list of their friends, as well as other information
associated with their Facebook accounts, through our Download Your
Information tool. We also recently introduced Access Your Information--
a secure way for people to access and manage their information, such as
posts, reactions, comments, and things you've searched for. Users can
go here to delete anything from their timelines or profiles that they
no longer want on Facebook.
If someone adds this information to their profile, they can later
choose to remove a friend relationship. If they do so, we retain the
fact that the friend relationship was removed in order to properly
display privacy-protected content (for example, to avoid showing
Friends-only information to people who previously had access) and for
other purposes related to protecting the safety and privacy of people
on Facebook.
h. Every friend ever deleted from a user's network?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects information regarding people a user
has removed as friends. Users can download deleted friend information,
as well as other information associated with their Facebook account,
through our Download Your Information tool. We also recently introduced
Access Your Information--a secure way for people to access and manage
their information, such as posts, reactions, comments, and things
they've searched for. Users can go here to delete anything from their
timelines or profiles that they no longer want on Facebook.
i. Every ad ever clicked on?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects information regarding dates, times,
and titles of ads clicked, although the retention period is limited.
Users can download information about ads clicked, as well as other
information associated with their Facebook accounts, through our
Download Your Information tool. Through Ad Preferences, people see and
control things like: (1) their ``interests,'' which are keywords
associated with a person based on activities such liking Pages and
clicking ads; (2) their ``behaviors'' (which we also call
``categories''), which generally reflect how, when, and where they
connect to Facebook; and (3) the advertisers that are currently showing
them ads based on the person's contact information, based on the
person's previous use of the advertiser's website or app, or based on a
visit to the advertiser's store. People also can choose whether we use
information about their activities on websites and apps off of Facebook
to show them ads through Facebook, and whether we can use their
Facebook advertising interests to show them ads off of Facebook.
People's use of these controls will, of course, affect the data we use
to show them ads.
j. Every IP address ever used when logging into Facebook?
Answer. Facebook automatically logs IP addresses where a user has
logged into their Facebook account. Users can download a list of IP
addresses where they've logged into their Facebook accounts, as well as
other information associated with their Facebook accounts, through our
Download Your Information tool, although this list won't include all
historical IP addresses as they are deleted according to a retention
schedule.
k. Every ``like''?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects posts, photos, or other content a
user has liked; likes on their own posts, photos, or other content; and
likes they've made on sites off of Facebook. Users can manage the
content and information they share when they use Facebook, including
``likes,'' through the Activity Log tool. We also recently introduced
Access Your Information--a secure way for people to access and manage
their information, such as posts, reactions, comments, and things
they've searched for. Users can go here to delete anything from their
timelines or profiles that they no longer want on Facebook.
If someone chooses to Like content on Facebook, they can later
choose to remove that like. If they do so, we will remove it from our
site and delete it in accordance with our Data Policy.
l. Every status change?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects status updates a user has posted.
Users can download status updates, as well as other information
associated with their Facebook accounts, through our Download Your
Information tool, and they can also manage the content and information
they share when they use Facebook, including status updates, through
the Activity Log tool. We also recently introduced Access Your
Information--a secure way for people to access and manage their
information, such as posts, reactions, comments, and things they've
searched for. Users can go here to delete anything from their timelines
or profiles that they no longer want on Facebook.
If someone adds this information to their profile, they can later
choose to delete it. If they do so, we will remove it from our site and
delete it in accordance with our Data Policy.
m. Every search of another person on Facebook?
Answer. Yes, Facebook collects searches a user has made on
Facebook. Users can manage the content and information they share when
they use Facebook, including searches, through the Activity Log tool.
We also recently introduced Access Your Information--a secure way for
people to access and manage their information, such as posts,
reactions, comments, and things they've searched for. Users can go here
to delete anything from their timeline or profile that they no longer
want on Facebook.
When a user searches for something on Facebook, they can access and
delete that query from within the search history in their Activity Log
at any time, but the log of that search is deleted after 6 months.
Question 2. Assuming the above is not exhaustive, please list all
types of data Facebook collects or otherwise acquires.
Answer. As explained in our Data Policy, we collect three basic
categories of data about people:
(1) data about things people do and share (and who they connect
with) on our services;
(2) data about the devices people use to access our services;
and
(3) data we receive from partners, including the websites and
apps that use our business tools.
As far as the amount of data we collect about people, the answer
depends on the person. People who have only recently signed up for
Facebook have usually shared only a few things--such as name, contact
information, age, and gender. Over time, as people use our products, we
receive more data from them, and this data helps us provide more
relevant content and services. That data will fall into the categories
noted above, but the specific data we receive will, in large part,
depend on how the person chooses to use Facebook. For example, some
people use Facebook to share photos, so we receive and store photos for
those people. Some people enjoy watching videos on Facebook; when they
do, we receive information about the video they watched, and we can use
that information to help show other videos in their News Feeds. Other
people seldom or never watch videos, so we do not receive the same kind
of information from them, and their News Feeds are likely to feature
fewer videos.
The data we have about people also depends on how they have used
our controls. For example, people who share photos can easily delete
those photos. The same is true of any other kind of content that people
post on our services. Through Facebook's Activity Log tool, people can
also control the information about their engagement--i.e., their likes,
shares and comments--with other people's posts. The use of these
controls of course affects the data we have about people.
We recently announced improvements to our Download Your Information
tool, as well as a new feature that makes it easier for people to see
the information that's in their account on Facebook. These recently-
expanded tools for accessing your information will allow people to see
their data, delete it, and easily download and export it.
Question 3. Please list all data that Facebook generates based on
user inputs.
Answer. Depending on which Services a person uses, we collect
different kinds of information from or about them. This is described in
our Data Policy:
Things you and others do and provide. Information and
content you provide. We collect the content, communications,
and other information you provide when you use our Products,
including when you sign up for an account, create or share
content, and message or communicate with others. This can
include information in or about the content you provide (like
metadata), such as the location of a photo or the date a file
was created. It can also include what you see through features
we provide, such as our camera, so we can do things like
suggest masks and filters that you might like, or give you tips
on using camera formats. Our systems automatically process
content and communications you and others provide to analyze
context and what's in them for the purposes described below.
Learn more about how you can control who can see the things you
share.
Data with special protections. You can choose to
provide information in your Facebook profile fields or Life
Events about your religious views, political views, who you
are ``interested in,'' or your health. This and other
information (such as racial or ethnic origin, philosophical
beliefs, or trade union membership) could be subject to
special protections under the laws of your country.
Networks and connections. We collect information about the
people, Pages, accounts, hashtags, and groups you are connected
to and how you interact with them across our Products, such as
people you communicate with the most or groups you are part of.
We also collect contact information if you choose to upload,
sync or import it from a device (such as an address book or
call log or SMS log history), which we use for things like
helping you and others find people you may know and for the
other purposes listed below.
Your usage. We collect information about how you use our
Products, such as the types of content you view or engage with;
the features you use; the actions you take; the people or
accounts you interact with; and the time, frequency and
duration of your activities. For example, we log when you're
using and have last used our Products, and what posts, videos,
and other content you view on our Products. We also collect
information about how you use features like our camera.
Information about transactions made on our Products. If you
use our Products for purchases or other financial transactions
(such as when you make a purchase in a game or make a
donation), we collect information about the purchase or
transaction. This includes payment information, such as your
credit or debit card number and other card information; other
account and authentication information; and billing, shipping
and contact details.
Things others do and information they provide about you. We
also receive and analyze content, communications, and
information that other people provide when they use our
Products. This can include information about you, such as when
others share or comment on a photo of you, send a message to
you, or upload, sync or import your contact information.
Device Information. As described below, we collect
information from and about the computers, phones, connected TVs
and other web-connected devices you use that integrate with our
Products, and we combine this information across different
devices you use. For example, we use information collected
about your use of our Products on your phone to better
personalize the content (including ads) or features you see
when you use our Products on another device, such as your
laptop or tablet, or to measure whether you took an action in
response to an ad we showed you on your phone on a different
device.
Information we obtain from these devices includes:
Device attributes: information such as the operating
system, hardware and software versions, battery level,
signal strength, available storage space, browser type, app
and file names and types, and plugins.
Device operations: information about operations and
behaviors performed on the device, such as whether a window
is foregrounded or backgrounded, or mouse movements (which
can help distinguish humans from bots).
Identifiers: unique identifiers, device IDs, and other
identifiers, such as from games, apps or accounts you use,
and Family Device IDs (or other identifiers unique to
Facebook Company Products associated with the same device
or account).
Device signals: Bluetooth signals, and information
about nearby Wi-Fi access points, beacons, and cell towers.
Data from device settings: information you allow us to
receive through device settings you turn on, such as access
to your GPS location, camera, or photos.
Network and connections: information such as the name
of your mobile operator or ISP, language, time zone, mobile
phone number, IP address, connection speed and, in some
cases, information about other devices that are nearby or
on your network, so we can do things like help you stream a
video from your phone to your TV.
Cookie data: data from cookies stored on your device,
including cookie IDs and settings. Learn more about how we
use cookies in the Facebook Cookies Policy and Instagram
Cookies Policy.
Information from partners. Advertisers, app developers, and
publishers can send us information through Facebook Business
Tools they use, including our social plug-ins (such as the Like
button), Facebook Login, our APIs and SDKs, or the Facebook
pixel. These partners provide information about your activities
off Facebook--including information about your device, websites
you visit, purchases you make, the ads you see, and how you use
their services--whether or not you have a Facebook account or
are logged into Facebook. For example, a game developer could
use our API to tell us what games you play, or a business could
tell us about a purchase you made in its store. We also receive
information about your online and offline actions and purchases
from third-party data providers who have the rights to provide
us with your information. Partners receive your data when you
visit or use their services or through third parties they work
with. We require each of these partners to have lawful rights
to collect, use and share your data before providing any data
to us.
Application of European Data Protection Rules
Facebook is not the first company to experience a data breach or
have its users' data misappropriated. Previously disclosed data
breaches include Equifax, Uber, Yahoo, eBay, AOL, Target, and Home
Depot. This suggests that there is a real need for a Federal regulatory
scheme.
The European Union recently adopted the General Data Protect
Regulation (GDPR), which requires businesses to protect the personal
data and privacy of EU citizens. These EU rules also protect the
exportation of personal data outside the EU.
On April 4, 2018, Mr. Zuckerberg publicly committed to ``make all
the same controls and settings available everywhere, not just in
Europe.''
However, according to an April 2018 Reuters report, Facebook
intends on altering its terms of service to ensure that non-EU users
will have their data processed by Facebook USA. The result is change is
that GDPR protections would no longer cover the more than 1.5 billion
international Facebook users who are not EU citizens.
Question 1. Is Facebook still committed to making GDPR privacy
settings available to ``everywhere''?
Answer. Yes. The controls and settings that Facebook is enabling as
part of GDPR are available to people around the world, including
settings for controlling our use of face recognition on Facebook and
for controlling our ability to use data we collect off Facebook Company
Products to target ads. We recently began providing direct notice of
these controls and our updated terms to people around the world
(including in the U.S.), allowing people to choose whether or not to
enable or disable these settings or to consent to our updated terms. We
provide the same tools for access, rectification, erasure, data
portability, and others to people in the U.S. and rest of world that we
provide in Europe, and many of those tools (like our Download Your
Information tool, ad preferences tool, and Activity Log) have been
available globally for many years.
a. For users in the United States, will Facebook commit to adopting
a broad definition of ``personal information'' including information
associated with an identifier number rather than a name is exempt from
regulation?
Answer. Facebook is generally not opposed to regulation but wants
to ensure it is the right regulation. The issues facing the industry
are complex, multi-faceted, and affect an important part of peoples'
lives. As such, Facebook is absolutely committed to working with
regulators, like Congress, to craft the right regulations. Facebook
would be happy to review any proposed legislation and provide comments.
b. For users in the United States, will Facebook commit to
requiring affirmative consent should they seek to use or disclose
personal information?
Answer. We are seeking explicit consent from people in Europe to
three specific uses of data: facial recognition data (which previously
was not enabled in Europe), special categories of data, and use of data
we collect off Facebook Company Products to target ads. We recently
began providing direct notice of these controls and our updated terms
to people around the world (including in the U.S.), allowing people to
choose whether or not to enable or disable these settings or to agree
to our updated terms. Outside of Europe we are not requiring people to
complete those flows if they repeatedly indicate that they do not want
to go through the experience. At the same time, the events of recent
months have underscored how important it is to make sure people know
how their information is used and what their choices are. So, we
decided to communicate prominently on Facebook--through a full-screen
message and a reminder to review at a later date. People can choose to
dismiss or ignore these messages and continue using Facebook.
GDPR does not require consent for most uses of personal
information, and instead, recognizes that many uses of data are
necessary to provide a service or within a companies' legitimate
interests or the public interest. We agree that different levels of
consent or notice are appropriate depending on the type of information
or contemplated use at issue.
c. For users in the United States, will Facebook allow customers to
access, correct, retrieve, and delete their personal information?
Answer. We enable people, including people in the United States, to
learn more about the data we collect through interactive tools such as
Download Your Information, which lets people download a file containing
data that they may want to take to another service, and through Access
Your Information, a tool we've launched for people to more easily
access and manage their data on Facebook. People can also control their
information through their Settings and the Privacy Shortcuts tool that
we're rolling out now.
d. For users in the United States, will Facebook commit to
requiring individual notification in the event of a data breach?
Answer. Yes.
Question 2. If not, please explain why Facebook no longer will
apply GDPR protections to all Facebook users.
Answer. As explained in the previous question, the controls and
settings that Facebook is enabling as part of GDPR are already
available to other people around the world, including settings for
controlling our use of face recognition on Facebook and for controlling
our ability to use data we collect off Facebook Company Products to
target ads. We also provide the same tools for access, rectification,
erasure, data portability, and others to people in the U.S. and rest of
world that we provide in Europe, and many of those tools (like our
Download Your Information tool, Ads Preferences tool, and Activity Log)
have been available globally for many years.
Question 3. If Facebook does not intend to make GDPR protections
available to users in the United States, please explain in detail how
Facebook will ensure these users are covered by robust data protection
policies?
Answer. As explained in the previous response, Facebook will be
making the same controls and settings available under GDPR to people in
the U.S.
Question 4. Will Facebook change its default settings to minimize
the collection and use of U.S. user data?
Answer. We regularly review and update our settings to help people
protect their privacy and give people choices about how their
information is used and who can see it. That's why, for example, in
2014 we changed the default audience for posts from Public to Friends,
and why we now ask people when they create a new account who they would
like to see the things they post--their friends, the public, or a
different audience.
Foreign Propaganda and Facebook Revenue
Last November, the Senate Intelligence Committee held a hearing on
Social Media Influence in our 2016 elections where executives from
Facebook, Twitter and Google testified. Following the hearing, I
submitted 50 written questions to Facebook and the other companies.
The responses I received were evasive and some were nonresponsive.
Please respond to the following question to the best of your ability.
Where you have learned new information since submitting answers to
previous QFRs, please supplement and amend your previous answers.
Question 1. How much revenue does Facebook earn from the user
engagement that results from foreign propaganda?
Answer. We believe that annual revenue that is attributable to
inauthentic or false accounts is immaterial.
Question 2. How much revenue does Facebook earn from the user
engagement that results from fake news?
Answer. See Response to Question 1.
Question 3. How much revenue does Facebook earn from the user
engagement that results from hyper-partisan content?
Answer. We do not have a definition of hyper-partisan, as defining
what is hyper-partisan is difficult and controversial.
Question 4. What does Facebook do with money received from an
entity that is found, either through internal audits or third-party
notification, to be using the platform to distribute foreign
propaganda, fake news, or hyper-partisan content?
Answer. Fraudulent ads are not allowed on Facebook. They are in
breach of our advertising policies and we will remove them when we find
them. Where we discover ads that violate our policies or applicable
laws, we do not generally return money to those attempting to deceive
our users. Instead, we make investments in areas to improve security on
Facebook and beyond. In addition, the investments that we are making to
address security issues are so significant that we have informed
investors that we expect that the amount that we will spend will impact
our profitability.
Question 5. How many employees are dedicated to addressing foreign
propaganda?
Answer. We expect to have at least 250 people specifically
dedicated to safeguarding election integrity on our platforms, and that
number does not include the thousands of people who will contribute to
this effort in some capacity. This type of abuse touches a number of
different teams at Facebook. Thousands on our Business Integrity team
will be working to better enforce our ad policies and to review more
ads, and a significant number of engineers will build tools to identify
ad and election abuse, and to enable us to follow through on our
commitment to bring greater transparency to ads with political content.
Facebook Data Abuse Bounty
In April 2018, Facebook's announced a new ``Data Abuse Bounty''
program to ``reward people who report any misuse of data by app
developers.''
According to your press release, ``this program will reward people
with first-hand knowledge and proof of cases where a Facebook platform
app collects and transfers people's data to another party to be sold,
stolen or used for scams or political influence.''
Facebook also promised to shut down any offending apps if it
confirms that an app has abused user data.
Question 1. Please list what abuses of data this program has
identified and whether Facebook has investigated or is in the process
of investigating these abuses.
Answer. This is a pilot program. We assess all submissions for
validity, and if valid, conduct an investigation. Since launching the
program we have received and are reviewing hundreds of reports. Updates
about the Bug Bounty Program and the Data Abuse Bounty Program will be
posted at https://www.facebook.com/bugbounty and https://
www.facebook.com/data-abuse.
Question 2. Please list how many offending apps have been
identified and subsequently shut down.
Answer. Since launching the program we have received and are
reviewing hundreds of reports. Updates about the Bug Bounty Program and
Data Abuse Bounty Program will be posted at https://www.facebook.com/
bugbounty and https://www.facebook.com/data-abuse.
Question 3. Please explain how and when you intend to notify users
impacted by newly-discovered data abuses.
Answer. Where we find evidence that these or other apps did misuse
data, we will ban them and notify people whose data was shared with
these apps.
Question 4. Upon identifying a malicious app, has Facebook
considered other punitive measures beyond denying apps access to the
platform (such as fines, lawsuits, etc.)? If not, please explain why
not.
Answer. We use a variety of tools to enforce Facebook policies
against violating parties, including developers. We review tens of
thousands of apps per year and regularly disapprove noncompliant apps
as part of our proactive review process. We also use tools like cease
and desist letters, account suspensions, letter agreements, and civil
litigation. For example, since 2006, Facebook has sent over 1,150
cease-and-desist letters to over 1,600 targets. In 2017, we took action
against about 370,000 apps, ranging from imposing certain restrictions
to removal of the app from the platform. Moreover, we have required
parties who have procured our data without authorization to delete that
data. We have invested significant resources in these efforts. Facebook
is presently investigating apps that had access to large amounts of
information before we changed our platform policies in 2014 to
significantly reduce the data apps could access. To date around 200
apps (from a handful of developers: Kogan, AIQ, Cube You, the Cambridge
Psychometrics Center, myPersonality, and AIQ) have been suspended--
pending a thorough investigation into whether they did in fact misuse
any data.
Additionally, we have suspended an additional 14 apps, which were
installed by around one thousand people. They were all created after
2014, after we made changes to more tightly restrict our platform APIs
to prevent abuse. However, these apps appear to be linked to AIQ, which
was affiliated with Cambridge Analytica.
Embedding Employees in Campaigns
Facebook often embeds staff with advertising clients to help them
target their campaigns. Brad Parscale, the Trump Campaign's digital
director, said of Facebook: ``we had their staff embedded inside our
offices,'' and ``Facebook employees would show up for work every day in
our offices.'' Mr. Parscale said that staff provided to the Trump
Campaign by Facebook and other companies worked ``side by side'' with
Cambridge Analytica.
Press reports indicate that Cambridge Analytica ultimately had 13
people working on the Trump campaign's digital operation, headquartered
in San Antonio.
Question 1. What services did embedded Facebook staff provide?
Answer. Facebook representatives advise political advertisers on
Facebook, as they would with other, non-political managed accounts.
During the 2016 election cycle, Facebook worked with campaigns to
optimize their use of the platform, including helping them understand
various ad formats and providing other best practices guidance on use
of the platform. No one from Facebook was assigned full-time to the
Trump campaign, or full-time to the Clinton campaign.
Question 2. Did these employees have a set of rules, standards or
regulations under which they provide these services?
Answer. We have a compliance team that trains our sales
representatives to comply with all Federal election law requirements in
this area.
Question 3. Was there a mechanism through which they could alert
Facebook if they had concerns about the campaign's activities?
Answer. Facebook employees are encouraged to raise any concerns
about improper activity to their managers.
Question 4. How many people did Facebook send to San Antonio to
work with the Trump Campaign's digital operation? For how long?
Answer. We offered identical support to both the Trump and Clinton
campaigns, and had teams assigned to both. Everyone had access to the
same tools, which are the same tools that every campaign is offered.
The campaigns did not get to ``hand pick'' the people who worked with
them from Facebook. And no one from Facebook was assigned full-time to
the Trump campaign, or full-time to the Clinton campaign. Both
campaigns approached things differently and used different amounts of
support.
Question 5. Did Facebook employees embedded with the campaign work
directly or indirectly with Cambridge Analytica?
Answer. While no one from Facebook was assigned full-time to the
Trump campaign, Facebook employees did interact with Cambridge
Analytica employees. While our investigation is ongoing, our review
indicates that Facebook employees did not identify any issues involving
the improper use of Facebook data in the course of their interactions
with Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign.
Question 6. What, exactly, did the Facebook ``embeds'' work on with
Cambridge Analytica in San Antonio?
Answer. In general, political data firms working on the 2016
campaign had access to Facebook's advertising support services,
including technical support, and best practices guidance on how to
optimize their use of Facebook. Everyone had access to the same tools,
which are the same tools that every campaign is offered. No one from
Facebook was assigned full-time to the Trump campaign.
Question 7. Were Facebook employees aware of data sets that may
have been scraped from Facebook users?
Answer. While our investigation is ongoing, our review indicates
that Facebook employees did not identify any issues involving the
improper use of Facebook data in the course of their interactions with
Cambridge Analytica during the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign.
Question 8. Did Facebook work with Cambridge Analytica, directly or
indirectly, on ad optimization or voter targeting?
Answer. Facebook representatives provide general ad support to
political advertisers on Facebook, as they do with other, non-political
managed accounts. During the 2016 election cycle, for example, Facebook
provided technical support and best practices guidance to advertisers,
including Cambridge Analytica, on using Facebook's advertising tools.
Question 9. Did Cambridge Analytica or Parscale's digital operation
purchase media on Facebook?
Answer. Yes.
Question 10. Reports suggest that the Special Counsel has met with
at least one Facebook employee who worked in San Antonio. Is Facebook
cooperating fully with the investigation?
Answer. We have stated publicly that we have cooperated with the
Special Counsel.
Question 11. What role has Facebook played in supporting Cambridge
Analytica/SCL work on elections in other countries (in Africa, the
Caribbean, former Soviet Republics, etc.)?
Answer. Facebook did not provide support to Cambridge Analytica/SCL
in connection with elections in other countries. It also appears from
the best information we have to date that Kogan only provided SCL with
data on Facebook users from the United States. Kogan and SCL have
consistently maintained that Kogan never provided SCL with any data for
Facebook users outside the United States, which is supported by a
contract between Kogan's company and SCL, which was furnished by
Christopher Wylie to the UK Parliament.
Question 12. Did Facebook, in the past 4 years, embed employees
with Cambridge Analytica for foreign electoral campaigns/referenda,
including Brexit or elections in Nigeria, Kenya, the Czech Republic,
Lithuania, or Georgia?
Answer. No.
Question 13. Has Facebook ever provided support to Secure America
Now, a political action committee targeting swing state voters with
anti-Muslim messaging?
Answer. We did not work directly with Secure America Now; we worked
through a third-party advertising agency. Neither did we create any
content for Secure America Now. As is customary across managed
advertising agencies, we provided a general best practices training to
the agency staff. As is also customary, we provided the measurement
tools to determine the efficacy of the ads and differences between
formats.
Question 14. Who at Facebook would have overseen work on this
account?
Answer. We did not work directly with Secure America Now; we worked
through a third-party advertising agency.
Question 15. Did it raise any ethical concerns within Facebook? If
not, please explain.
Answer. See Response to Question 13.
We recognize how important it is for Facebook to be a place where
people feel empowered to communicate, and we take our role in keeping
abuse off our service seriously. Our mission entails embracing diverse
views. We err on the side of allowing content, even when some find it
objectionable, unless removing that content prevents a specific harm.
That said, we do not allow hate speech on our platform because it
creates an environment of intimidation and exclusion and in some cases
may promote real-world violence.
We define hate speech as a direct attack on people based on what we
call protected characteristics--race, ethnicity, national origin,
religious affiliation, sexual orientation, sex, gender, gender
identity, and serious disability or disease. We also provide some
protections for immigration status. We define attack as violent or
dehumanizing speech, statements of inferiority, and calls for exclusion
or segregation. Our detailed hate speech policies are available at
https://www.facebook.com/
communitystandards/objectionable_content/hate_speech.
We have Community Standards that prohibit hate speech, bullying,
intimidation, and other kinds of harmful behavior. We hold advertisers
to even stricter advertising policies to protect you from things like
discriminatory ads--and we have recently tightened our ad policies even
further to prohibit additional shocking and sensational content.
Third-Party Data Aggregators and Third-Party Transfers
Prior to March 2017, Facebook worked with third-party data
aggregators to enhance existing data sets. As a result, advertisers had
access to data collected by Facebook and data collected by third
parties such as Experian and Acxion.
In the aftermath of the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica debacle,
Facebook announced that it would be shutting down Partner Categories
and that third-party data providers would no longer be able to offer
their targeting directly on Facebook.
This verbal commitment is laudable but must be implemented in order
to ensure the public's data are safeguarded.
Question 1. Please detail any efforts Facebook has initiated and/or
completed to identify other improper third-party data transfers.
Answer. We are in the process of investigating every app that had
access to a large amount of information before we changed our Platform
in 2014. If we find suspicious activity, we will take immediate steps
to investigate (including a full forensic audit) or take enforcement
actions against the app. If we determine that there has been improper
use of data, we will ban those developers and notify everyone affected.
Facebook is launching the Data Abuse Bounty to reward people who report
any misuse of data by app developers. The Data Abuse Bounty, inspired
by the existing bug bounty program that we use to uncover and address
security issues, will help us identify violations of our policies.
Question 2. What, if any, external audits has Facebook completed to
ensure that all third parties are following Facebook privacy policies?
Answer. See Response to Question 1.
Facebook's New Partnership with Independent Researchers
On April 9, 2018 the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation,
announced it would fund a research initiative to examine Facebook's
role in elections and democracy.
The fund will support an independent committee of scholars who will
define research topics and vet research proposals that explore the
intersection of elections, democracy, and social media.
In addition, according to media reports, Facebook has reportedly
agreed to give research accesses to proprietary data.
Question 1. Facebook has limited this new initiative to prospective
studies. Will Facebook commit to allowing studies of Russian
interference in the 2016 election?
Answer. Facebook recently announced a new initiative to help
provide independent, credible research about the role of social media
in elections, as well as democracy more generally. It will be funded by
the Laura and John Arnold Foundation, Democracy Fund, the William and
Flora Hewlett Foundation, the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation,
the Charles Koch Foundation, the Omidyar Network, and the Alfred P.
Sloan Foundation. At the heart of this initiative will be a group of
scholars who will:
Define the research agenda;
Solicit proposals for independent research on a range of
different topics; and
Manage a peer review process to select scholars who will
receive funding for their research, as well as access to
privacy-protected datasets from Facebook which they can
analyze.
Facebook will not have any right to review or approve their
research findings prior to publication. More information regarding the
study is available at https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/04/new-
elections-initiative/.
Question 2. The new initiative also does not appear to cover
studies on privacy and security, even though those are some of the most
pressing issues related to your platform. Will you commit to expanding
the initiative to cover privacy and security?
Answer. We regularly work with privacy experts outside the company,
including academics, to understand how to improve privacy protections
for people on Facebook and to support efforts to improve privacy
protections for people overall. For example, we recently hosted a
workshop for privacy academics to discuss research around online
privacy and worked with academics as a part of recent privacy
consultations that we have conducted at our headquarters and around the
world.
Also, we recently announced plans to collaborate with academics and
other privacy experts as a part of our efforts to build Clear History,
a new feature that will enable people to see the websites and apps that
send us information when they use them, delete this information from
their account, and turn off our ability to store it associated with
their account going forward.
Question 3. Given that many of the issues with Facebook relate to
income, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and other diverse
groups, will you commit to ensuring that this committee includes
individuals who will adequately represent perspectives of these diverse
groups?
Answer. In consultation with the foundations funding the
initiative, Facebook will invite respected academic experts to form a
commission which will then develop a research agenda about the impact
of social media on society--starting with elections. We are keen to
have a broad range of experts--with different political outlooks,
expertise and life experiences, gender, ethnicity, and from a broad
range of countries.
Discriminatory Ad Practices
Facebook offers advertisers ``targeting categories'' that range
from ethnic affinity, education level, political affiliation, and
employment status. The categories may seem innocuous but invariably
serve as proxies for demographic characteristics such as race, family
status, class, and sexual orientation.
A recent Pro Publica report revealed that, in February 2017,
companies could still buy rental-housing ads on Facebook and request
that those ads not be shown to certain categories of users including
African Americans, mothers of high school kids, people interested in
wheelchair ramps, Jewish people, and Spanish speakers.
As of March 27, 2018 housing rights advocates are suing Facebook in
Federal court for allowing real estate brokers and landlords to exclude
select certain categories--family status, sex, and disability--when
targeting advertisements.
Question 1. Does Facebook still allow advertisers to target based
on the abovementioned categories?
Answer. Discriminatory advertising has no place on Facebook's
platform and Facebook removes such content as soon as it becomes aware
of it. Facebook's policies prohibit advertisers from discriminating
against people on personal attributes such as race, ethnicity, color,
national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender
identity, family status, disability, and medical or genetic conditions.
Facebook educates advertisers on our anti-discrimination policy, and in
some cases, requires the advertisers to certify compliance with
Facebook's anti-discrimination policy and anti-discrimination laws.
Facebook also uses machine learning to help identify ads that offer
housing, employment, or credit opportunities. When an advertiser
attempts to show an ad that Facebook identifies as offering a housing,
employment, or credit opportunity and includes Facebook's multicultural
advertising segments, Facebook will disapprove the ad. Facebook also
requires advertisers to certify that they are complying with Facebook's
updated anti-discrimination policy and anti-discrimination laws when
the advertiser attempts to show a housing, employment, or credit
opportunity and uses any other audience segment on Facebook.
Question 2. Do you agree this categorization lends itself to
discriminatory practices?
Answer. See Response to Question 1.
Question 3. As Facebook works to reform company policies, how will
Facebook protect the civil rights of all Facebook users?
Answer. We have Community Standards that prohibit hate speech,
bullying, intimidation, and other kinds of harmful behavior. We hold
advertisers to even stricter advertising policies to protect users from
things like discriminatory ads. We don't want advertising to be used
for hate or discrimination, and our policies reflect that. For example,
we make it clear that advertisers may not discriminate against people
based on personal attributes such as race, ethnicity, color, national
origin, religion, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, family
status, disability, and medical or genetic condition. We educate
advertisers on our anti-discrimination policy, and in some cases--
including when we detect that an advertiser is running a housing ad--we
require advertisers to certify compliance with our anti-discrimination
policy and anti-discrimination laws.
We look forward to finding additional ways to combat
discrimination, while increasing opportunity for underserved
communities, and to continuing our dialogue with policymakers and civil
rights leaders about these important issues.
Question 4. Will you commit to modifying your existing policies and
procedures to ensure that housing discrimination is prohibited on your
platform?
Answer. See Response to Question 3.
2015 Cambridge Analytical Leak and Decision not to Notify Users
On March 17, 2018, the New York Times reported that the data
analytics firm, Cambridge Analytica, had secretly harvested the
personal data of millions of Facebook users.
Reports have confirmed that Facebook knew of this data breach in
December 2015, but declined to notify the affected users.
On April 10, 2018, Mr. Zuckerberg confirmed that such a decision
had, in fact, been made. At a Joint hearing with the Senate Commerce
and Judiciary Committees, when asked whether there was ``decision made
[by Facebook] not to inform the users [of the breach],'' Mr. Zuckerberg
replied ``that is my understanding, yes.''
Question 1. Please explain how, and when, Facebook first became
aware of Cambridge Analytica's misappropriation of Facebook users'
data?
Answer. On December 11, 2015, The Guardian published an article
reporting that Kogan and his company, GSR, may have passed information
the app had obtained from Facebook users to SCL Elections Ltd. (SCL)/
Cambridge Analytica. As part of its investigation, Facebook contacted
Kogan and Cambridge Analytica to investigate the allegations reflected
in the reporting. Thereafter, Facebook obtained written certifications
or confirmations from Kogan, GSR, and other third parties (including
Cambridge Analytica and SCL) declaring that all such data they had
obtained was accounted for and destroyed. In March 2018, Facebook
received information from the media suggesting that the certification
we received from SCL may not have been accurate and immediately banned
SCL Group and Cambridge Analytica from purchasing advertising on our
platform. Since then, Facebook has been actively investigating the
issue, including pursuing a forensic audit of Cambridge Analytica,
which is currently paused at the request of the UK Information
Commissioner's Office (which is separately investigating Cambridge
Analytica).
Mr. Zuckerberg did not become aware of allegations that Cambridge
Analytica may not have deleted data about Facebook users obtained from
Kogan's app until March of 2018, when these issues were raised in the
media.
Question 2. What steps did Facebook take in deciding not to inform
impacted Facebook users of Cambridge Analytica's misappropriation of
their data? When did Facebook decide not to inform Facebook users who
were impacted?
Answer. When Facebook learned about Kogan's breach of Facebook's
data use policies in December 2015, it took immediate action. The
company retained an outside firm to assist in investigating Kogan's
actions, to demand that Kogan and each party he had shared data with
delete the data and any derivatives of the data, and to obtain
certifications that they had done so. Because Kogan's app could no
longer collect most categories of data due to changes in Facebook's
platform, the company's highest priority at that time was ensuring
deletion of the data that Kogan may have accessed before these changes
took place. With the benefit of hindsight, we wish we had notified
people whose information may have been impacted. Facebook has since
notified all people potentially impacted with a detailed notice at the
top of their newsfeed.
Question 3. Who at Facebook made the decision not to inform
Facebook users?
Answer. See Response to Question 2.
Question 4. What was the rationale for this decision?
Answer. See Response to Question 2.
Question 5. When did Mr. Zuckerberg learn of this breach and the
decision not to inform users?
Answer. See Response to Question 2.
Question 6. Are there changes in place to improve the way Facebook
responds to these breaches in the future?
Answer. Facebook allows people to view, manage, and remove the apps
that they have logged into with Facebook through the App Dashboard. We
recently prompted everyone to review their App Dashboard as a part of a
Privacy Checkup, and we also provided an educational notice on Facebook
to encourage people to review their settings. More information about
how users can manage their app settings is available at https://
www.facebook.com/help/218345114850283?helpref=about_content.
The categories of information that an app can access is clearly
disclosed before the user consents to use an app on Facebook platform.
Users can view and edit the categories of information that apps they
have used have access to through the App Dashboard.
Question 7. Please list other instances of abuse where Facebook
user data was misappropriated and a decision was made not to inform
users or where the company failed to inform users.
Answer. See Response to Question 6.
Annual Transparency Report
On June 1, 2017 Facebook shareholders voted down a transparency
proposal requesting that ``Facebook issue a report reviewing the public
policy issues associated with fake news enabled by Facebook. The report
should review the impact of current fake news flows and management
systems on the democratic process, free speech, and a cohesive society,
as well as reputational and operational risks from potential public
policy developments.''
Facebook's board of directors urged a no vote on the proposal,
calling the report ``unnecessary'' and ``not beneficial to
shareholders.'' The shareholder proposal failed.
Since then, Facebook has publicly acknowledged that Russian actors
purchased ads to manipulate and interfere with the election. It took
Facebook two years and a whistleblower before to disclose the data
breach by Cambridge Analytica.
It appears that the ordinary practice and tendency of Facebook--
like most other companies--is to advocate for less disclosure.
Question 1. Will Facebook commit to producing an annual public
transparency report to your shareholders?
Answer. Facebook publishes an annual transparency report, the most
recent report was issued on May 15, 2018 and can be found here: https:/
/transparency.facebook.com/.
