I. Executive Summary
Statement From the Chairs
The Congressional-Executive Commission on China
(Commission) was established by the U.S.-China Relations Act of
2000 (Public Law No. 106-286) as China prepared to enter the
World Trade Organization. The Commission is mandated to monitor
human rights and the development of the rule of law in China,
and to submit an annual report to the President and Congress.
The Commission is also mandated to maintain a database of
political prisoners in China--individuals who have been
detained or imprisoned by the Chinese government for exercising
their internationally recognized civil and political rights, as
well as rights protected by China's Constitution and other
domestic laws.
The Commission's 2019 Annual Report covers the period from
August 2018 to August 2019. The comprehensive findings and
recommendations in this report focus on the Chinese
government's compliance with or violation of internationally
recognized human rights, including the right to free
expression, peaceful assembly, religious belief and practice,
as well as any progress or regression on the development of the
rule of law. As discussed in the subsequent chapters of this
report, the human rights and rule of law conditions in China
have continued to worsen this past year.
A part of the Commission's mandate is the inclusion of
recommendations for legislative and executive action. In
addition to the recommendations contained in this report, the
Commission drafted, edited, and provided support for numerous
legislative initiatives over the last year, including those
related to human rights in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous
Region, Hong Kong's autonomy and rule of law, Tibet policy and
human rights, the 30th anniversary of the 1989 Tiananmen
protests, and the use of advanced technology to facilitate
human rights abuses in China.
Over the past year, the Commission held congressional
hearings on ``Hong Kong's Future in the Balance: Eroding
Autonomy and Challenges to Human Rights,'' ``Tiananmen at 30:
Examining the Evolution of Repression in China,'' and ``The
Communist Party's Crackdown on Religion in China.'' The
Commission also held a town hall event in New York City with
the New York and New Jersey Tibetan communities. The Commission
regularly conducts congressional briefings and meetings with
non-governmental organizations, academics, legal professionals,
and human rights advocates. The Commission's Political Prisoner
Database is an important tool for documenting political
prisoners in China and providing publicly accessible
information on individual cases for U.S. Government officials,
advocates, academics, journalists, and the public.
As Legislative and Executive Branch decisionmakers seek a
more effective strategy for promoting human rights and the rule
of law in China, the Commission plays an essential role in
reporting on conditions, raising awareness of human rights
violations, and informing U.S. policy. We are grateful for the
opportunity to serve as the Commission Chair and Co-Chair, and
we appreciate the attention of the U.S. Congress and
Administration to the issues highlighted in this report.
Sincerely,

Overview
It has been three decades since China's People's Liberation
Army was ordered to forcefully end the peaceful protests for
political reform in Tiananmen Square and throughout China. The
violent suppression of the 1989 Tiananmen protests was a key
turning point in history as the Chinese government and
Communist Party suspended experiments in openness and reform
and strengthened a hardline approach to prevent the growth of
independent civil society and reinforce their control over the
people of China.
Since the Tiananmen crackdown, the Chinese government and
Party have expanded a costly and elaborate authoritarian system
designed to intimidate, censor, and even imprison Chinese
citizens for exercising their fundamental human rights,
including freedom of expression, peaceful assembly, and freedom
of religion. Authorities targeted and imprisoned citizens
calling for democratic reform--including Nobel Peace Prize
laureate Liu Xiaobo, who took part in the Tiananmen protests
and co-authored Charter 08, a political treatise that called
for constitutional government and respect for human rights. In
the years since Tiananmen, Liu Xiaobo spent a total of almost
16 years in detention and died in state custody in 2017.
After Xi Jinping became Chinese Communist Party General
Secretary in 2012, and President in 2013, the space for human
rights advocacy and political reform narrowed further as the
Chinese government and Party exerted a tighter grip over
governance, law enforcement, and the judiciary. Under President
Xi's tenure, authorities launched a nationwide crackdown on the
legal community and rights defenders; curtailed civil society,
academia, and religious life; led an anticorruption campaign
that helped remove political opposition inside the Party; and
eliminated term limits on the presidency, signaling Xi's
intention to remain in power indefinitely.
During its 2019 reporting year, the Congressional-Executive
Commission on China (Commission) found that the human rights
situation has worsened and the rule of law continued to
deteriorate, as the Chinese government and Party increasingly
used regulations and laws to assert social and political
control. The Chinese government continued its crackdown on
``citizen journalists'' who report on human rights violations,
with mainstream Chinese journalists calling conditions in China
an ``era of total censorship.'' The abuse of criminal law and
police power to target rights advocates, religious believers,
and ethnic minority groups also continued unabated, and
reporting on such abuses became increasingly restricted.
Further, the Chinese government has become more efficient
in the use of advanced technology and information to control
and suppress the people of China. Nowhere is this more of a
concern than in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR),
where the Commission believes Chinese authorities may be
committing crimes against humanity against the Uyghur people
and other Turkic Muslims. Over the past year, Chinese
authorities have expanded a system of extrajudicial mass
internment camps in the XUAR. Although the true number of
detainees has not been publicly reported, experts estimate one
million or more Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui, and others
currently are or have been detained and subjected to abuse and
forced labor in mass internment camps.
Outside the camps, the Chinese government and Party have
created a pervasive and high-tech surveillance system in the
XUAR that some observers have called an ``open-air prison.''
The system integrates facial recognition cameras and real-time
monitoring of cell phones into an Orwellian policing platform
that observes every aspect of life in the XUAR and allows
Chinese officials to tighten their control of Uyghurs and other
Turkic Muslims in the region. This surveillance system is
implemented--often with the assistance of domestic and
international businesses--using security personnel and
surveillance technology that helps Chinese officials repress
Uyghurs and others in the XUAR.
As the world commemorated the 30th anniversary of the
Tiananmen Square Massacre in 2019, China's leaders not only
refused to provide a full, public, and independent accounting
of events, but also continued to prohibit any public mourning
by the families of the victims and censored discussion of the
events of 1989 in mainland China. Hundreds of thousands of
people joined together in Victoria Park in Hong Kong to
participate in a candlelight vigil on the Tiananmen
anniversary.
In Hong Kong, millions of people took to the streets to
protest the Hong Kong government's introduction of a bill to
amend the city's extradition law, revisions that would put
anyone in Hong Kong--including U.S. citizens--at risk of
extradition to mainland China, where lack of due process and
custodial abuses have been well documented. The protest on June
16, 2019, which organizers estimated had over two million
participants, was spurred by the unwillingness of the Hong Kong
government to formally withdraw the extradition bill. As
protests continued throughout the summer, Hong Kong police used
rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper spray, and water cannons
against peaceful protesters. Although consideration of the
extradition law amendments was suspended, protesters continued
to call for the bill to be withdrawn and for accountability for
the excessive use of force by the Hong Kong police and criminal
gangs--who were suspected of working with police--against
protesters.
The 2019 Hong Kong protests are a manifestation of an
unprecedented grassroots movement revealing deep discontent
with the erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy. Under the ``one
country, two systems'' framework based on the 1984 Sino-British
Joint Declaration and established by Hong Kong's Basic Law, the
Chinese government agreed to allow Hong Kong a ``high degree of
autonomy'' with the ``ultimate aim'' of electing its Chief
Executive and Legislative Council members by universal
suffrage. Yet instead of making progress toward universal
suffrage, Hong Kong authorities have prosecuted and sentenced
pro-democracy leaders, disqualified and removed pro-democracy
legislators from office, and introduced a new national anthem
bill that would restrict free expression. In addition, mainland
Chinese authorities continued to arbitrarily detain Hong Kong
bookseller Gui Minhai, who was first abducted in 2015. Anson
Chan, the former Hong Kong Chief Secretary and Legislative
Council member, recently offered this insight: ``If only
Beijing would understand what makes Hong Kong tick, what are
the values we hold dear, then they can use that energy to
benefit both China and Hong Kong. Instead, they have this
mentality of control.''
In Tibet, the 60th anniversary of the Dalai Lama's escape
into exile passed without any progress toward a genuine
dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama or
his representatives. This past year, Chinese authorities
continued to systematically repress the peaceful exercise of
internationally recognized human rights and intensify their
restrictions on the religious and cultural life of Tibetans.
Access to the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) remained tightly
controlled, with international journalists reporting that it
was more difficult to visit the TAR than North Korea. In a
white paper issued in March 2019, the Chinese government
restated the claim that it has the sole authority to select the
next reincarnation of the Dalai Lama, in violation of the
religious freedom of the Tibetan Buddhist community.
Chinese authorities continued to aggressively target
unregistered Christian churches this past year as part of the
implementation of new regulations on religious affairs. In a
troubling development, congregations with hundreds of
worshipers were officially banned, including Zion Church and
Shouwang Church in Beijing municipality; Rongguili Church in
Guangzhou municipality, Guangdong province; and the Early Rain
Covenant Church in Chengdu municipality, Sichuan province.
Sources also reported Protestant church closures in Guizhou,
Henan, Anhui, and Zhejiang provinces.
The Chinese government and Communist Party seek to
legitimize their political model internationally while
preventing liberal and universal values from gaining a foothold
inside China. The Party's United Front Work Department and
Central Propaganda Department are increasingly active beyond
China's borders, working to influence public perceptions about
the Chinese government and neutralize perceived threats to the
Party's ideological and policy agenda. These efforts focus
heavily on shaping the mediums through which ideas about China,
what it means to be Chinese, and Chinese government activities
are understood. The practical effect of these activities is the
exportation of the Party's authoritarian values. On the ground,
this takes multiple forms, such as interfering in multilateral
institutions; threatening and intimidating critics of the
Chinese government; imposing censorship mechanisms on foreign
publishers and social media companies; influencing academic
institutions and critical analysis of China's past history and
present policies; and compelling American companies to conform
to the Party's narratives and to convey those narratives to
U.S. policymakers. Chinese government-led investment and
development projects abroad, such as the Belt and Road
Initiative, bring with them a robust non-democratic political
agenda. Just as at home, the Chinese government tries to
integrate economic development and political control to
leverage the market without endangering the Party's
authoritarian values.
The people of China continued to actively organize and
advocate for their rights, despite the Chinese government's
deepening repression. In the labor sector, non-governmental
organizations and citizen journalists documented numerous
worker strikes and other labor actions over the past year,
despite an expanded crackdown on labor advocates and citizen
journalists throughout the country. At Jasic Technology in
Shenzhen municipality, Guangdong province, workers who
attempted to set up a trade union were taken into custody in a
crackdown starting in July 2018. Authorities also detained
supporters of the Jasic workers, including university students,
labor rights advocates, and citizen journalists, many of whom
remained in detention as of August 2019. Earlier this year,
Chinese internet technology workers launched a campaign against
exploitative work hours--referred to as ``996,'' a 9 a.m. to 9
p.m. schedule for six days a week common in many Chinese
companies. Such long hours violate China's labor laws.
Women in China continued to face severe discrimination in
hiring, wages, and promotions along with gender bias and sexual
harassment in the workplace. Public pressure from advocacy
campaigns, including a #MeToo-inspired movement, led Chinese
officials to initiate policies to address sexual harassment and
gender discrimination in employment. Nonetheless, inadequate
enforcement and discriminatory laws persist.
Rising authoritarianism in China is one of the most
important challenges of the 21st century. In the coming
decades, global challenges will require a constructive Chinese
role that respects and elevates the voices of over 1.3 billion
people in China instead of suppressing them. U.S. foreign
policy must prioritize the promotion of universal human rights
and the rule of law in China, not only to respect and protect
the basic dignity of the people of China, but to better promote
security and prosperity for all of humanity.
Executive
Summary
Executive
Summary
Key Findings
Freedom of Expression
The Chinese government and Communist Party
continued to restrict freedom of expression and freedom
of the press in contravention of international human
rights standards.
At the UN Human Rights Council's third
Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of China's compliance
with international human rights norms, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) reported that the Chinese
government and Communist Party violated freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. NGO stakeholders
raised concerns about Chinese government influence over
the UPR process.
Conditions for journalism in China continued
to deteriorate. Some professional Chinese journalists
described current conditions for journalism as an ``era
of total censorship.'' In addition, the government's
ongoing crackdown on ``citizen journalists'' who have
founded or are associated with websites that document
human rights violations continued, as seen in the
detention of individuals focused on labor conditions,
such as Wei Zhili, Yang Zhengjun, and Ke Chengbing.
Foreign journalists faced multiple challenges from the
government, including surveillance, harassment, and
obstruction.
The government and Party continued to link
internet security to national security. This past year,
authorities detained and prosecuted individuals who
criticized government officials and policies online.
Authorities also censored or distorted a range of news
and information that the government deemed
``politically sensitive,'' including the 30th
anniversary of Tiananmen, rights conditions in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), the protests
in Hong Kong against proposed extradition legislation,
and trade issues.
Declining academic freedom in China linked to
Party General Secretary and President Xi Jinping's
reassertion of ideological control over universities
was illustrated by reports of the internment of
hundreds of predominantly Uyghur scholars in mass
internment camps in the XUAR; the detentions of
university students who advocated for labor rights; and
the dismissal, suspension, and other forms of
discipline imposed on faculty who criticized the
government and Party.
Worker Rights
China's laws and practices continue to
contravene international worker rights standards,
including the right to create or join independent trade
unions. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, an
organization under the direction of the Chinese
Communist Party, remains the only trade union
organization permitted under Chinese law.
The Chinese government did not publicly report
on the number of worker strikes and protests, and NGOs
and citizen journalists continued to face difficulties
in obtaining comprehensive information on worker
actions. The Hong Kong-based NGO China Labour Bulletin
documented 1,702 strikes and other labor actions in
2018, up from 1,257 strikes and other labor actions in
2017. In March 2019, Chinese internet technology
workers launched a campaign against ``996''--a 9 a.m.
to 9 p.m. schedule for six days a week common in many
Chinese technology companies. The campaign began with a
project on the Microsoft-owned software development
platform Github that identified how the schedule
violates provisions in Chinese labor laws. The project
received over 200,000 stars indicating popular support.

During the 2019 reporting year, Chinese
authorities restricted the ability of civil society
organizations to work on labor issues, and authorities
expanded a crackdown on labor advocates across China.
As of August 2019, authorities continued to detain over
50 workers and labor advocates, including Fu Changguo,
Zhang Zhiyu (more widely known as Zhang Zhiru), and Wu
Guijun.
Chinese authorities and university officials
monitored, harassed, and detained students and recent
graduates who advocated on behalf of workers.
Authorities detained approximately 50 supporters of
workers who attempted to organize an independent union
at Jasic Technology in Shenzhen municipality, Guangdong
province, including Peking University graduate Yue Xin.
In October 2018, Cornell University's School of
Industrial and Labor Relations suspended two student
exchange programs with Renmin University due to ``gross
violations of academic freedom'' in China. As of May
2019, Chinese authorities had detained 21 members of
the Marxist Society at Peking University, including Qiu
Zhanxuan and Zhang Shengye.
Government data showed a continued decline in
workplace deaths this past year, although Chinese
workers and labor organizations expressed concern about
inadequate safety equipment and training. In March
2019, a chemical explosion killed 78 people in Jiangsu
province, the largest industrial accident in China
since 2015.
Criminal Justice
Chinese government and Communist Party
officials continued to abuse criminal law and police
power to ``maintain stability'' (weiwen) with the goal
of perpetuating one-party rule. The Chinese government
used the criminal law to target rights advocates,
religious believers, and ethnic minority groups.
The government continued to claim that it
reserved the death penalty for a small number of crimes
and only the most serious offenders. Amnesty
International estimated that China carried out more
executions than any other country. The death penalty
disproportionately targeted ethnic and religious
minorities, such as Muslim Uyghurs, for their religious
beliefs.
Authorities continued to use various forms of
arbitrary detention to deprive individuals of their
liberty this past year, contravening international
human rights standards.
Authorities held rights advocates, lawyers,
petitioners, and others in prolonged pretrial
detention, including under ``residential surveillance
at a designated location,'' a form of incommunicado
detention that can last up to six months, restricts
access to counsel, and places detainees at risk of
abuse by authorities.
Freedom of Religion
Scholars and international rights groups have
described religious persecution in China over the last
year to be of an intensity not seen since the Cultural
Revolution. Chinese Communist Party General Secretary
and President Xi Jinping has doubled down on the
``sinicization'' of religion--a campaign that aims to
bring religion in China under closer official control
and into conformity with officially sanctioned
interpretations of Chinese culture. Authorities have
expanded the ``sinicization'' campaign to target not
only religions perceived as ``foreign,'' such as Islam
and Christianity, but also Han Buddhism, Taoism, and
folk religious beliefs.
Violations of the religious freedom of Hui
Muslim believers continued to intensify, with plans to
apply ``anti-terrorism'' measures currently used in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region (Ningxia)--a region with a high
concentration of Hui Muslim believers. A five-year plan
to ``sinicize'' Islam in China was passed in January
2019. Meanwhile, ongoing policies included measures
requiring Islamic religious leaders and lay believers
to demonstrate their political reliability.
Chinese authorities continued to subject
Protestant Christian believers in China belonging to
both official and house churches to increased
surveillance, harassment, and control. The Commission
observed reports this past year of official bans of
large unregistered churches, including Zion Church and
Shouwang Church in Beijing municipality; Rongguili
Church in Guangzhou municipality, Guangdong province;
and Early Rain Covenant Church in Chengdu municipality,
Sichuan province. After the PRC Ministry of Foreign
Affairs signed an agreement with the Holy See in
September 2018 paving the way for unifying the state-
sanctioned and underground Catholic communities, local
Chinese authorities subjected Catholic believers in
China to increasing persecution by demolishing
churches, removing crosses, and continuing to detain
underground clergy.
As in previous years, authorities continued to
detain Falun Gong practitioners and subject them to
harsh treatment, with 931 practitioners reportedly
sentenced for criminal ``cult'' offenses in 2018. Human
rights organizations and Falun Gong practitioners
documented coercive and violent practices against
practitioners during custody, including physical
violence, forced drug administration, and other forms
of torture.
Bans on religious belief proliferated at the
local level for students and various professionals.
Party disciplinary regulations were revised to impose
harsher punishment on members for manifestations of
religious belief.
Ethnic Minority Rights
Authorities carried out the physical
destruction and alteration of Hui Muslim spaces and
structures, continuing a recent trend away from
relative toleration of Hui Muslim communities. These
changes narrowed the space for Hui Muslim believers to
assert an ethnic and religious identity distinct from
that of the dominant Han Chinese population.
Mongol herders in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region demonstrated and petitioned the
government over the loss of traditional grazing lands.
As in past reporting years, authorities detained some
of the Mongol herders who peacefully protested.
Population Control
Central government authorities rejected calls
to end birth restrictions, despite population experts
and National People's Congress delegates voicing
demographic, economic, and human rights concerns over
the Chinese government's population control policies.
The Commission continued to observe reports of Chinese
authorities threatening or imposing punishments on
families for illegal pregnancies and births, using
methods including heavy fines, job termination, and
abortion.
The Chinese government's restrictive family
planning policies have exacerbated China's aging
society and sex ratio imbalance. Human trafficking for
forced marriage and commercial sexual exploitation
continue to be challenges that have worsened under the
decades-long population control policies implemented by
the Chinese government.
Special Topic: Migrant Neighborhoods a Target of Anti-Crime and Vice
Campaign
An anti-crime campaign launched by central
authorities in 2018 was used to target marginalized
groups in China. Called the ``Specialized Struggle to
Sweep Away Organized Crime and Eliminate Vice,'' the
stated aims of the three-year campaign include
guaranteeing China's lasting political stability and
further consolidating the foundation of Communist Party
rule.
The Commission observed reports of local
governments invoking this anti-crime campaign in order
to target petitioners (individuals and groups who seek
redress from the government), religious believers,
village election candidates, and lawyers. Some local
governments have also increased monitoring of internal
migrant neighborhoods in the name of the anti-crime
campaign.
Status of Women
Women in China face severe discrimination
throughout their careers, from job recruitment and
hiring to wages and promotions. Gender bias and sexual
harassment in the workplace are major factors
contributing to the employment gender gap, as well as
national laws mandating parental leave and other
entitlements for women but not men.
Despite official repression, independent
public advocacy for women's rights continue to
influence public discourse and policy. Following
significant public pressure via advocacy campaigns led
by grassroots activists, Chinese officials initiated
policies to address gender discrimination in
employment. Nonetheless, inadequate enforcement and
discriminatory laws persist.
Thirty percent of women have experienced some
form of domestic violence, yet as of December 2018--
nearly three years after the passage of the PRC Anti-
Domestic Violence Law in March 2016--Chinese courts had
issued only a total of 3,718 protection orders.
Human Trafficking
Chinese authorities subjected Uyghur Muslims
and other ethnic minorities in the XUAR to forced labor
in the production of food, textiles, and other goods.
Women and girls from countries including Burma
(Myanmar), Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Mongolia, North
Korea, Pakistan, and Vietnam were trafficked into China
for forced marriage and sexual exploitation; and
individuals from Burma, Mongolia, Nepal, and North
Korea were trafficked to China for the purpose of
forced labor. Chinese nationals were trafficked outside
of China to other parts of the world, including the
United States.
The government of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) reportedly continued to
generate revenue by sending DPRK nationals to work in
China under conditions that may constitute forced
labor, in possible violation of UN sanctions.
Hong Kong remained a destination for the
trafficking of migrant domestic workers from Indonesia
and the Philippines who face exploitative working
conditions.
North Korean Refugees in China
The Chinese government continued to detain
North Korean refugees in China and repatriate them to
the DPRK, where they face severe punishment, including
torture, imprisonment, forced labor, and even
execution. The repatriation of North Korean refugees
violates China's obligations under international human
rights and refugee law and may amount to ``aiding and
abetting crimes against humanity.'' This past year,
Chinese and North Korean authorities reportedly imposed
stricter border controls to deter North Korean refugees
from escaping the DPRK.
The majority of North Korean refugees leaving
the DPRK are women. The Chinese government's refusal to
recognize these women as refugees denies them legal
protection and may encourage the trafficking of North
Korean women and girls within China. Many children born
to Chinese fathers and North Korean mothers remain
deprived of basic rights to education and other public
services, owing to their lack of legal resident status
in China, which constitute violations of the PRC
Nationality Law and the Convention on the Rights of the
Child.
Public Health
Food safety and vaccine safety scandals have
continued to flare up in the past year, despite the
Chinese government's attempts in the past decade to
improve quality control. Analysts point to a lack of
accountability, weak regulatory capacity and
enforcement of laws, corruption, and government
procurement systems that favor low-cost goods. The
National People's Congress passed a new vaccine
management law in June 2019 aimed at strengthening
vaccine supervision, penalizing producers of
substandard or fake vaccines, and introducing
compensation for victims of faulty vaccines.
Despite strong regulations aimed at improving
food and vaccine safety and punishment for companies
and individuals found guilty of criminal acts,
authorities also continued to detain citizens for
speaking out and organizing protests, including victims
and parents of children who received tainted vaccines.
Chinese authorities reportedly continued to
forcibly commit individuals to psychiatric facilities,
including government critics and those with grievances
against government officials and legal processes, even
though the PRC Mental Health Law prohibits such abuses.
The Environment
Environmental pollution remained a major
challenge in China due to authorities' top-down
approach to environmental challenges, transparency
shortcomings, and the suppression and detention of
environmental advocates. The Chinese government's
vision of environmental governance was articulated in
the National Development and Reform Commission's work
report for 2018, which states, ``the government leads,
enterprises are the main actors, and social
organizations and the public participate.'' The role
for the public in environmental protection, however,
remained limited.
In 2018, carbon dioxide emissions in China
continued to increase, as Chinese state-owned banks
funded international coal-fired power projects. While
the Chinese government continued to report progress in
environmental protection, a March 2019 ranking of air
pollution in over 3,000 cities around the world,
indicated that 57 of the 100 most polluted cities in
2018 (based on fine particulate concentrations) were in
China.
Business and Human Rights
Chinese domestic businesses and international
businesses are increasingly at risk of complicity in
the egregious human rights violations committed by the
Chinese Communist Party and government. For example, in
the XUAR, experts have documented the rapid expansion
of a network of mass internment camps in which
authorities have arbitrarily detained over a million
individuals from predominantly Muslim ethnic minority
groups. The company Hangzhou Hikvision Digital
Technology has supplied surveillance systems to the
camps as part of a public-private partnership with XUAR
authorities.
The Commission observed numerous reports this
past year of forced labor in the XUAR. One
investigation found that materials from firms using
forced labor in the XUAR had entered the supply chains
of major international clothing companies including
Adidas, H&M, Nike, and Patagonia.
Chinese security authorities continued to work
with domestic companies to expand the reach and
analytical power of government surveillance systems
across China. Chinese technology firms SenseTime,
Megvii, CloudWalk, Yitu, and Tiandy all reportedly sold
technology to Chinese authorities for use in
surveillance systems. The government uses this
technology to surveil rights advocates and others the
government views as threats.
Civil Society
In the past few years, the Chinese government
has harshly repressed human rights lawyers, women's
rights advocates, labor rights defenders, citizen
journalists, and petitioners. In conjunction with the
continued implementation of legislative and regulatory
reforms passed in 2016 and the increased role and
purview of the Party over all aspects of Chinese
society, the space non-governmental organizations
(NGOs) had in which to carry out human rights advocacy
activities continued to shrink.
The Chinese government highlighted overseas
NGOs as threats to China's ``political security,''
without defining the term. The Chinese government
invoked this vague term to crack down on organizations
working in human rights and rule-of-law advocacy.
Chinese government efforts to suppress labor
advocacy--labeling such advocacy as driven by foreign
interests--made it increasingly difficult for workers
in China to organize grassroots efforts and advocate
for their rights. Chinese authorities carried out a
large-scale nationwide crackdown on labor rights
advocates that began in July 2018 when workers at the
Jasic Technology factory in Shenzhen municipality,
Guangdong province, attempted to organize a labor union
and received widespread national support from
university students and internet users. Authorities
portrayed the labor protests as orchestrated by a
``foreign-funded'' NGO, and harassed, physically
assaulted, detained, and prosecuted labor advocates and
supporters.
The Chinese government continued to suppress
the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and
questioning (LGBTQ) individuals in China. LGBTQ
individuals faced a multitude of challenges, including
a lack of legal protections. The Chinese government
cracked down on organizations and rights defenders
active on LGBTQ issues. Nevertheless, LGBTQ advocates
supported online campaigns highlighting workplace
discrimination and sexual harassment, and censorship.
The Chinese government has not followed multiple
recommendations from UN bodies regarding LGBTQ
protections.
Institutions of Democratic Governance
China's one-party authoritarian political
system remains out of compliance with international
human rights standards because authorities deprived
citizens of the right to meaningfully participate in
the electoral process and in public affairs in general.
As General Secretary Xi Jinping continued to
promote rule-based governance, the Chinese Communist
Party passed a series of rules to formalize the manner
and extent of the Party's control over the government
and society. These rules reinforced the all-
encompassing authority of the Party and centralized
personal leadership of Xi Jinping. One set of rules
formalized the Party's longstanding control over the
judiciary, the procuratorate, public security agencies,
national security agencies, and judicial administration
agencies.
Central authorities also issued rules to
regulate personnel management in the government by
requiring civil servants to receive political
indoctrination and by imposing political considerations
as criteria for career advancement. In one instance,
the Party Central Committee issued an opinion
prohibiting officials from expressing views
inconsistent with or ``improperly discussing'' the
Party's policy even outside of work hours.
Citizens' opportunities to participate in
limited local elections diminished this past year.
Chinese authorities reduced the frequency of elections
for grassroots-level committees--from once every three
years to once every five years--in order to synchronize
with the terms of the corresponding Party offices,
thereby ``complementing the Party's complete
leadership.''
On the international stage, China
categorically denied responsibility for human rights
violations despite evidence of human rights abuses. It
further rejected recommendations to cease the practice
of arbitrary detention and rejected calls to release
political prisoners.
Access to Justice
Chinese authorities continued to influence the
judiciary, control the legal profession, and persecute
human rights lawyers in violation of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.
Official media's promotion of the Party's
absolute leadership over the judiciary had a negative
impact on the overall judicial process. The Supreme
People's Court planned to amend past judicial
interpretations to conform to the approved political
ideology and not issue any new judicial interpretations
unless the topic is specified by the Party. With
respect to the legal profession, the Minister of
Justice urged lawyers to ``unify their thoughts'' and
to accept the Party's complete leadership over their
work.
Authorities continued to view legal
representation provided by human rights lawyers as a
threat to the Party's political security, as they
continued to criminally prosecute them on charges such
as ``subversion of state power.'' Authorities also
restricted the speech and movement of human rights
lawyers, and in some cases stripped them of their law
licenses.
Xinjiang
In the past year, authorities in the XUAR
expanded a system of extrajudicial mass internment
camps, arbitrarily detaining one million or more
Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui, and others. Security
personnel at the camps subjected detainees to torture,
including forced ingestion of drugs; punishment for
behavior deemed religious; forced labor; overcrowding;
deprivation of food; and political indoctrination.
Authorities transferred some detainees from mass
internment camps in the XUAR to detention facilities in
other parts of China, due to factors including
overcrowding in camps within the XUAR and authorities'
desire to conceal information on camp detainees. Some
detainees reportedly died in camps due to poor
conditions, medical neglect, or other reasons.
Scholars and rights groups provided strong
arguments, based on available evidence, showing that
the ``crimes against humanity'' framework may apply to
the case of mass internment camps in the XUAR. Article
7 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal
Court provides a list of 11 acts, any one of which may
constitute ``crimes against humanity'' ``when committed
as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed
against any civilian population, with knowledge of the
attack.''

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mass internment camp detainees reportedly
included permanent residents of the United States and
Australia. American officials stated in March 2019 that
Chinese authorities may have detained several American
residents in mass internment camps. As of April 2019,
authorities had reportedly detained more than a dozen
Australian residents. In addition, at least five
Australian children reportedly were unable to leave the
XUAR due to restrictions on the freedom of movement of
their parents in the XUAR.
Authorities reportedly placed the children of
mass internment camp detainees in the XUAR in
orphanages, welfare centers, and boarding schools,
often despite the willingness of other relatives to
care for the children, raising concerns of forcible
assimilation.
XUAR government authorities continued to use
surveillance technology and other measures to tighten
state control over ethnic minority groups in the
region, and to identify individuals to detain in mass
internment camps. A Human Rights Watch report
documented authorities' continued use of a centralized
system known as the ``Integrated Joint Operations
Platform'' (IJOP) to compile and analyze information
collected through mass surveillance mechanisms in the
XUAR and detect ``abnormal'' behaviors, targeting
individuals for detention in camps or other types of
restriction on movement.
Tibet
The Chinese government and Communist Party
significantly tightened restrictions on access to the
Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas
in China for international journalists, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), foreign officials,
scholars, and members of the Tibetan diaspora. Chinese
authorities require all foreign visitors to the TAR to
apply for a special permit. Tourists must be
accompanied by government-designated tour guides, and
are only allowed to see controlled sites. International
journalists have stated that the isolation of the TAR
is worse than that of North Korea, allowing the Chinese
government to conceal human rights abuses and
environmentally damaging large-scale activities, such
as damming rivers and mining, and to promote the claim
that Tibetans benefit from and support the Party and
its actions.
The government and Party intensified security
and surveillance in the TAR and other Tibetan
autonomous areas, using increasingly advanced
technology, and continued an ``anti-crime and vice
campaign'' to crack down on Tibetans suspected of
organizing or participating in activities that
authorities deem to be threatening to government
control or ``social stability.''
Authorities continued to restrict the
religious freedom of Tibetan Buddhists under the
``sinicization'' campaign, which aims to bring religion
in China under closer official control and into
conformity with officially sanctioned interpretations
of Chinese culture. Actions taken included mandatory
political education for religious leaders, large-scale
evictions from influential monasteries, banning
religious activities for youth, and replacing images of
the Tibetan Buddhists' spiritual leader, the Dalai
Lama, with past and current Party leaders Mao Zedong
and Xi Jinping.
The Chinese government continued to pursue
large-scale infrastructure and investment projects in
the TAR and other Tibetan areas, including hydropower
dams, mines, and the resettlement of Tibetan nomads,
with no apparent representative input from the Tibetan
population, independent environmental NGOs, or rights
groups. These activities violate the social, economic,
and cultural rights of Tibetans, such as their rights
to housing and livelihood, and raised concerns among
environmental scientists and advocates about their
regional and global impact.
The Panchen Lama, Gedun Choekyi Nyima, whom
the Dalai Lama recognized in May 1995, reached his 30th
birthday on April 25, 2019, while remaining
incommunicado in government custody at an unknown
location. Moreover, in violation of the religious
freedom of Tibetan Buddhists, the Party continued to
promote public appearances by its chosen Panchen Lama,
Gyaltsen Norbu, including his first trip abroad to
Thailand, and to a sacred Buddhist site, adding to
speculation that Chinese officials will eventually
attempt to use him in efforts to select the next Dalai
Lama.
Developments in Hong Kong and Macau
The Commission observed a further erosion of
Hong Kong's autonomy and fundamental freedoms under the
``one country, two systems'' framework. The Hong Kong
government sought to advance changes to the territory's
extradition law to allow the surrender of individuals
to mainland China and to empower the Chief Executive to
make decisions on fugitive arrangements on a case-by-
case basis without a vetting process in the Legislative
Council (LegCo). If passed, the bill would expose local
and foreign citizens transiting, visiting, or residing
in Hong Kong to the risk of being extradited to China.
A series of mass protests against the
extradition bill on the scale of tens of thousands to
two million took place in Hong Kong beginning in March
2019, garnering widespread international attention and
concern. Protests continued throughout the summer,
despite the Hong Kong government's decision to
suspend--but not withdraw--consideration of the
extradition bill. Protesters demanded that the
government formally withdraw the extradition bill,
create an independent commission to investigate reports
of the excessive use of force by police during the
protests, retract the characterization of the June 12
demonstrations as a ``riot,'' drop all charges against
arrested anti-extradition bill protesters, and pursue
democratic reforms to allow for universal suffrage in
Hong Kong's elections.
Over the past year, the Hong Kong government
continued to reject the candidacy of LegCo and local
election nominees such as Lau Siu-lai and Eddie Chu
Hoi-dick based on their political beliefs and
associations, violating Article 21 of the Hong Kong
Bill of Rights Ordinance, which guarantees the right to
``vote and be elected at genuine periodic elections.''
The Hong Kong government continued to pursue
criminal charges against leaders and participants of
public demonstrations, including the 2014 pro-democracy
protests (``Umbrella Movement''). In April 2019, a Hong
Kong court found nine leaders of the Umbrella Movement
guilty of charges related to ``public nuisance'' and
sentenced Benny Tai Yiu-ting and Chan Kin-man to 16
months in prison and Raphael Wong and Shiu Ka-chun to 8
months in prison.
The Hong Kong government limited the freedoms
of expression, association, and assembly by banning the
pro-independence Hong Kong National Party (HKNP) and
rejecting the visa renewal request of Financial Times
Asia editor Victor Mallet who hosted an event featuring
Andy Chan, founder of the HKNP, months earlier. An
event featuring dissident artist Badiucao was canceled
over ``safety concerns'' after authorities from the
Chinese government reportedly issued threats against
the artist.
Chinese government influence over the
territory, and Hong Kong officials' willingness to
conform to the interests of the Chinese government,
continued a trend of decreased autonomy observed over
the past several years. This trend has implications for
both the protection of the rights and freedoms of the
people of Hong Kong and for the future of U.S. policy
towards Hong Kong, which is based on the territory's
continuing autonomy.
The Commission did not observe progress in
Macau toward universal suffrage in the 2019 Chief
Executive (CE) election. Former Macau Legislative
Assembly president Ho Iat Seng won the uncontested
election on August 25, 2019, because he was the only
candidate able to garner enough nominations in the 400-
member CE Election Committee.

Uyghur geographer who received
international acclaim for his
environmental research, authorities
accused Teyip of being a
``separatist,'' together with 5 other
Uyghur intellectuals. Authorities
reportedly cracked down on Teyip for
being ``two-faced,'' a term Chinese
officials use to refer to ethnic
minority cadres who pretend to support
the Chinese Communist Party. A student
of Teyip said his custom of beginning
public statements with a Uyghur
greeting may have prompted authorities
to target him.

Summary
General Recommendations to Congress and the Administration
As the Chinese government and Communist Party continue to
erode the rule of law in China and the human rights of the
Chinese people, the U.S. Government should develop coordinated
policies that reflect that pressing for greater transparency,
reciprocity, and adherence to universal standards is necessary
to advance American interests and the interests of Chinese
citizens eager for peace, rights protections, the rule of law,
and genuine political reform. A shared commitment to universal
human rights and the rule of law--and willingness to act in
their defense--is the foundation for the cooperative alliances,
security partnerships, and multilateral consultative mechanisms
underpinning U.S. power since the end of World War II. The
Commission makes the following recommendations for
consideration by Congress and the Administration:
Develop a Whole-of-Government Approach to Human
Rights in China. In order to ensure that the U.S. Government
can strategically address a more authoritarian China, the
President should issue a policy directive to develop a
comprehensive strategy embedding human rights, the rule of law,
and democratic governance into the critical mission strategies
of all U.S. Government entities interacting with the Chinese
government. This strategy should include expanding efforts
within the U.S. Government to counter disinformation, coercive
political influence operations, and censorship efforts,
particularly those targeting diaspora communities. As the
Administration develops this strategy, attention should be paid
to messaging and programs that address the rights violations
that affect the largest number of Chinese citizens,
particularly workers, families, religious believers, ethnic
minority groups, internet users, women, and rural residents;
avoid fostering an atmosphere of unfair suspicion of Chinese-
Americans who are often targets of coercive political influence
operations; and inform Chinese nationals of their civil rights
while living, studying, or working in the United States.
Address Abuses in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous
Region (XUAR). The Administration should aggregate policy
responses within the U.S. Government to address gross human
rights violations in the XUAR, including by:
Using Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability
Act (Public Law No. 114-328) sanctions to hold
accountable Chinese business entities and officials
complicit in the mass internment and surveillance of
Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslim minorities and to
encourage like-minded allies to issue their own
sanctions.
Controlling sales of new and emerging technologies,
including facial recognition systems, machine learning,
and biometric and artificial intelligence technologies,
by placing the XUAR government and security agencies on
the U.S. Department of Commerce's ``Entity List.''
Requesting an open debate or, at the very least, an
Arria-formula briefing at the UN Security Council on
the XUAR, and initiating or signing on to joint
statements on the XUAR at the UN Human Rights Council.
Creating guidelines for counterterrorism and law
enforcement cooperation with China and other countries
in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization to ensure that
the U.S. Government does not condone or assist in
Chinese authorities' crackdown on domestic political
dissent or restrictions on internationally recognized
human rights.
Working with Congress to pass legislation that
provides information and new authorities, including
export controls and limitations on U.S. Government
procurement from China, that will allow a more robust
approach to the Chinese government's atrocities in the
XUAR, including through passage of the Uyghur Human
Rights Policy Act of 2019 (S. 178/H.R. 649).
Hold Chinese Government Officials Accountable for
Abuses. In addition to the list-based sanctions of the Global
Magnitsky Act, the Administration should strategically use the
mechanisms available in the International Religious Freedom Act
of 1998 (Public Law No. 105-292), the Victims of Trafficking
and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (Public Law No. 106-386),
the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016
(Public Law No. 114-122), and the Admiral James W. Nance and
Meg Donovan Foreign Relations Authorization Act of 2000 (Public
Law No. 106-113--Appendix G) to levy financial sanctions
against or deny U.S.-entry visas to Chinese officials complicit
in human rights violations including severe religious freedom
restrictions and human trafficking.
Update the ``Tiananmen Sanctions.'' Congress
should strengthen existing sanctions prohibiting the sale of
``crime control and detection'' equipment (Public Law No. 101-
246 902(a)(4)) to the Chinese government to include related
services and training, as well as add language identifying and
controlling the technology needed for mass surveillance, the
creation of predictive policing platforms, and the gathering of
sensitive electronic or biometric information.
Condition Access to U.S. Capital Markets. The
Administration should identify and list Chinese companies and
entities with a presence in U.S. capital markets that have
provided material support or technical capabilities to
facilitate human rights abuses in China--including in the
XUAR--and strengthen disclosure requirements at the Securities
and Exchange Commission to alert American investors about the
presence of such Chinese entities in U.S. capital markets.
Address the Erosion of Hong Kong's Autonomy. The
Congress should pass the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy
Act of 2019 (S. 1838 / H.R. 3289), which requires an annual
certification of Hong Kong's autonomy to spur regular
discussions on how to maintain Hong Kong's special trade and
economic status under U.S. law. The bill also provides tools to
hold accountable Hong Kong and Chinese government officials who
suppress freedom of expression and assembly or undermine the
rule of law.
Update the Tibetan Policy Act. The Congress should
update the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 (Public Law No. 107-228)
to clarify in U.S. policy that the reincarnation of the Dalai
Lama is an exclusively religious matter that should be made
solely by the Tibetan Buddhist faith community. The legislation
should make clear that Chinese officials who interfere in the
process of recognizing a successor or reincarnation of the
Dalai Lama will be subject to targeted financial, economic, and
visa-related sanctions like those in the Global Magnitsky Act.
The Administration should heed the guidance from Congress on
the implementation of the Reciprocal Access to Tibet Act of
2018 (Public Law No. 115-330) and use the sanctions available
in the act against Chinese officials responsible for denying
Americans access to Tibetan regions.
Voice Support for Human Rights in China. Members
of Congress and Administration officials, especially the
President, should regularly meet with Chinese civil society and
human rights defenders, Hong Kong civil society, the Dalai Lama
and other Tibetans in exile including the Central Tibetan
Administration, members of the Uyghur diaspora, and other human
rights advocates and non-governmental organizations. It is also
essential that the President of the United States express
support for human rights and democracy in China.
Address Digital Authoritarianism. Because the
growth of digital authoritarianism is one of the most urgent
national security and human rights challenges associated with
the Chinese government's foreign policy, the Administration and
the Congress should work together to:
Lead a global effort with allies and partners to
develop a set of principles for Artificial Intelligence
(AI) development and usage to ensure the protection of
human rights, including the right to privacy.
Launch a digital infrastructure initiative that makes
information and communication technology development a
priority for U.S. foreign assistance programs,
including through implementation of the BUILD Act of
2018 (Public Law No. 115-254).
Counter Internet Censorship. The Administration
should develop a comprehensive interagency action plan to
promote internet freedom through the funding and wide
distribution of effective technologies that provide the
greatest possible access to the internet within China and
globally. The plan could include actively opposing the Chinese
government's efforts to establish a new international norm of
``internet sovereignty,'' expanding digital security training
for civil society advocates, and transparently employing
congressionally mandated funding to circumvent China's ``Great
Firewall.'' In addition, the Administration should develop
talking points for U.S. Government officials--including those
engaged in trade negotiations--that consistently link freedoms
of press, speech, and association to U.S. and Chinese
interests, noting how censorship prevents the free flow of
information on issues of public concern, including public
health and environmental crises, food safety problems, and
corruption.
Promote Transparency in University and Think Tank
Funding. As part of any amendment to the U.S. Higher Education
Act of 1965 (Public Law No. 89-329), Congress should require
U.S. colleges and universities to publicly report all foreign
gifts, contracts, and in-kind contributions that exceed $10,000
per year from a single foreign government, institution, or
group of institutions. U.S. think tanks and other non-
governmental organizations should be required to publicly
disclose all foreign grants and gifts as part of their tax
filings to maintain non-profit status.
Counter Foreign Malign Influence. The
Administration should provide to Congress a strategy to address
the strategic challenge posed by the Chinese government's
intensified use of disinformation, propaganda, economic
intimidation, and political influence operations to weaken
commitments to universal human rights and promote the Chinese
Communist Party's political-economic model globally. The
Administration should develop an action plan to counter the
Chinese government's ``sharp power'' efforts globally,
monitoring and controlling foreign influence operations and
providing information about the Chinese ministries, entities,
and individuals engaged in foreign influence operations and
their connections with entities of the Chinese Communist Party
or government. The Congress should pass the ``Countering the
Chinese Government and Communist Party's Political Influence
Operations Act'' (S. 480/H.R. 1811) that, among other
priorities, clarifies that U.S. Government policy and
statements should clearly differentiate between the Chinese
people and culture and the Chinese government and Communist
Party, ensuring that central Chinese government and Party
political influence operations do not lead to the targeting of
Chinese-Americans or the Chinese diaspora.
Expand the Mandate of the Foreign Agents
Registration Act (FARA). The Administration and the Congress
should work together to expand the mandate of the Foreign
Agents Registration Act of 1938 (FARA) (Act June 8, 1938, ch.
327, sec. 14) to bring oversight and transparency to issue
areas beyond foreign representation and address the challenges
the United States faces today, which include incidents of
Chinese Students and Scholars Associations working with Chinese
embassies and consulates in the United States, Confucius
Institutes and Classrooms at U.S. universities and high
schools, and American companies accepting funding from Chinese
sources to acquire technologies prohibited by U.S. export
controls.
Develop a Non-Governmental Code of Conduct. The
Administration should work with U.S. non-governmental
organizations and academic institutions to formulate a code of
conduct for interacting with Chinese government-affiliated
entities to assist them in navigating the challenges of working
effectively in China and to counter influence operations that
are manipulative, coercive, or corrupting of democratic
institutions and help protect human rights and academic
freedom.
Prioritize Reciprocity. The Administration, as
part of ongoing trade discussions, should seek a rules-of-the-
road agreement that will correct longstanding diplomatic,
investment, media, and cultural and academic exchange
imbalances in U.S.-China relations and provide to Congress a
strategy for pursuing reciprocity more generally in U.S.-China
relations, particularly to ensure that U.S.-based media outlets
and non-governmental organizations have the same freedom to
operate, publish, and broadcast afforded to a growing number of
Chinese government-sponsored and funded think tanks, academic
institutions, and media entities in the United States.
Expand Global Alliances to Advance Human Rights.
International responses to human rights have the greatest
impact when the U.S. Government exercises effective diplomatic
leadership with our allies and partners. The Administration
should send to Congress a multilateral human rights diplomacy
strategy on China, to coordinate responses when the Chinese
government uses multilateral institutions to undermine human
rights norms and closes off discussion of its failures to
uphold its international obligations. The Administration should
also consider as part of such strategy:
Creating a public mechanism for coordinating human
rights diplomacy and technical assistance programs with
like-minded allies that includes the meaningful
participation of experts and non-governmental
organizations from all participating countries.
Expanding funding for capacity-building initiatives
for rights and rule-of-law advocates in settings
outside China, given growing restrictions on the
funding of civil society organizations inside China.
Forming a multinational human rights dialogue where
the U.S. Government invites countries without human
rights dialogues with China (or those whose human
rights dialogues have been canceled by the Chinese
government) to participate in or observe formal
discussions with the Chinese government.
Coordinating public statements, diplomatic demarches,
and public diplomatic efforts to condemn detentions of
political and religious prisoners and other serious
human rights abuses in China, and creatively
communicating these efforts to the Chinese people.
Prioritize an End to Torture and Arbitrary
Detention Through Diplomatic Engagement. The Administration
should prioritize an end to torture in detention and all forms
of arbitrary detention in China and raise these issues in all
bilateral discussions and in multilateral institutions of which
the U.S. and China are members. The Administration should
create public diplomacy campaigns and support media efforts to
raise global awareness about the detention of political and
religious prisoners in ``black jails,'' psychiatric
institutions, compulsory drug detoxification centers, police
and state security detention centers, and mass internment camps
in the XUAR. In addition, the Administration should consider
funding non-governmental projects that assist individuals with
submissions to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, in
order to provide actionable information to the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights and UN system of Special
Procedures, and to accumulate evidence on Chinese officials
complicit in the torture and arbitrary detention of political
and religious prisoners.
Take Meaningful Action to Address Human
Trafficking. To respond to China's ``Tier 3'' designation for
failing to meet minimum standards for addressing human
trafficking, the Administration should use all the tools
available in the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection
Act of 2000 (Public Law No. 106-386) and the Girls Count Act of
2015 (Public Law No. 114-24), including individual sanctions
for officials and entities complicit in human trafficking. In
addition, the Administration should send Congress a strategy to
address forced labor in the XUAR, including by publicly
identifying Chinese businesses profiting from such labor,
assisting corporations to identify forced labor goods from the
XUAR in global supply chains, and expanding the use of the
``reasonable suspicion'' standard found in the Trade
Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 (TFTEA) (Public
Law No. 114-125) to stop goods made with forced labor from
entering the United States.
Protect North Korean Refugees. The Administration
should employ the tools available in the North Korean Human
Rights Act of 2004 (Public Law No. 108-333) and the North Korea
Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act (Public Law No. 114-122)
to expand efforts to channel uncensored news and information
into North Korea and to North Korean asylum seekers in China,
including through defector communities, and to impose secondary
sanctions on Chinese corporations, individuals, or banks that
profit from North Korean forced labor and those assisting the
North Korean government in avoiding international sanctions.
The Special Representative for North Korea at the Department of
State should provide Congress with a strategy to protect North
Korean refugees in China, implement the recommendations of the
Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in North Korea, and close
existing prison labor camps and other forms of arbitrary
detention in North Korea and in China where refugees are
detained.
Advocate for Specific Political Prisoners. Members
of Congress and Administration officials at the highest levels
should raise specific prisoner cases in meetings with Chinese
government officials. Experience demonstrates that consistently
and prominently raising individual prisoner cases--and the
larger human rights issues they represent--can result in
improved treatment in detention, lighter sentences or, in some
cases, release from custody, detention, or imprisonment. The
Administration should consider creating a Special Advisor for
Religious and Political Prisoners to coordinate interagency
resources on behalf of political and religious prisoners in
China and globally. Members of Congress are encouraged to
``adopt'' individual prisoners and advocate on their behalf
through the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission's ``Defending
Freedoms Project.''

Political Prisoner Database
Recommendations
When composing correspondence advocating on behalf of a
political or religious prisoner, or preparing for official
travel to China, Members of Congress and Administration
officials are encouraged to:
Check the Political Prisoner Database (PPD) (https://
ppdcecc.gov) for reliable, up-to-date information on a
prisoner or groups of prisoners. Consult a prisoner's
database record for more detailed information about the
prisoner's case, including his or her alleged crime,
specific human rights that officials have violated,
stage in the legal process, and location of detention
or imprisonment, if known.
Advise official and private delegations traveling to
China to present Chinese officials with lists of
political and religious prisoners compiled from
database records.
Urge U.S. state and local officials and private
citizens involved in sister-state and sister-city
relationships with China to explore the database, and
to advocate for the release of political and religious
prisoners in China.
A POWERFUL RESOURCE FOR ADVOCACY
The Commission's 2019 Annual Report provides information
about Chinese political and religious prisoners \1\ in the
context of specific human rights and rule-of-law abuses. Many
of the abuses result from the Chinese Communist Party and
government's application of policies and laws. The Commission
relies on the Political Prisoner Database (PPD), a publicly
available online database maintained by the Commission, for its
research, including the preparation of the Annual Report, and
routinely uses the database as a resource to prepare summaries
of information about and support advocacy for political and
religious prisoners for Members of Congress and Administration
officials. The Commission invites the public to read about
issue-specific Chinese political imprisonment in sections of
this Annual Report, and to access and make use of the PPD at
https://ppdcecc.gov. (Information about the PPD is also
available at https://www.cecc.gov/resources/political-prisoner-
database.)
The PPD received approximately 306,974 online requests for
prisoner information during the 12-month period ending July 31,
2019--a change of approximately negative 38.96 percent compared
with the 502,900 requests reported in the Commission's 2018
Annual Report for the 12-month period ending July 31, 2018.\2\
During the 12-month period ending in July 2019, the United
States remained the country of origin for the largest share of
requests for information, with approximately 27.2 percent of
such requests. China was in the second position, with
approximately 20.5 percent of such requests, followed by
Ukraine (3.9 percent), India (2.9 percent), the United Kingdom
(2.6 percent), Hong Kong (2.3 percent), Brazil (1.9 percent),
Canada (1.8 percent), the Russian Federation (1.7 percent),
France (1.6 percent), and the Republic of Korea (1.4 percent).
Internet Protocol addresses that do not provide information
about the name of the registrant or the type of domain were the
source of the largest share of online requests for information
during the Commission's 2019 reporting year, accounting for
approximately 52.6 percent of the 306,974 requests for
information in the 12-month period ending in July 2019. The
approximate number of requests from other sources are as
follows: Domains ending in .com were second, with 18.9 percent
of requests for PPD information. Domains ending in .net were
third, with 8.8 percent of online requests for information,
followed by U.S. Government domains (.gov) with 1.7, then by
domains for Brazil (.br) with 1.6 percent, India (.in) with
1.3, Germany (.de) with 1.0, Italy (.it) with 0.9, China (.cn)
with 0.9, the European Union (.eu) with 0.7, and Mexico (.mx)
with 0.7. Domains for Turkey (.tr), France (.fr), and the
Russian Federation (.ru) accounted for 0.6 percent of requests
each.
POLITICAL PRISONERS
The PPD seeks to provide users with prisoner information
that is reliable and up to date. Commission staff members work
to maintain and update political prisoner records based on the
staff member's area of expertise. Staff seek to provide
objective analysis of information about individual prisoners,
and about events and trends that drive political and religious
imprisonment in China.
As of September 1, 2019, the PPD contained information on
9,933 cases of political or religious imprisonment in China. Of
those, 1,587 are cases of political and religious prisoners
currently known or believed to be detained or imprisoned, and
8,346 are cases of prisoners who are known or believed to have
been released, who were executed, who died while imprisoned or
soon after release, or who escaped. The Commission notes that
there are considerably more than 1,587 cases of current
political and religious imprisonment in China. Commission staff
work on an ongoing basis to add cases of political and
religious imprisonment to the PPD.
When the PPD was first launched, the Dui Hua Foundation,
based in San Francisco, and the former Tibet Information
Network, based in London, shared their extensive experience and
data on political and religious prisoners in China with the
Commission to help establish the database. The Dui Hua
Foundation continues to do so. The Commission relies on its own
staff research for prisoner information, as well as on
information provided by non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
other groups that specialize in promoting human rights and
opposing political and religious imprisonment, and other public
sources of information.
MORE POWERFUL DATABASE TECHNOLOGY
The PPD has served since its launch in November 2004 as a
unique and powerful resource for the U.S. Congress and
Administration, other governments, NGOs, educational
institutions, and individuals who research political and
religious imprisonment in China, or who advocate on behalf of
prisoners. The July 2010 PPD upgrade significantly leveraged
the capacity of the Commission's information and technology
resources to support such research, reporting, and advocacy.
In 2015, the Commission enhanced the functionality of the
PPD to empower the Commission, the U.S. Congress and
Administration, other governments, NGOs, and individuals to
strengthen reporting on political and religious imprisonment in
China and advocacy undertaken on behalf of Chinese political
prisoners. The upgrade allowed the PPD full text search and the
basic search both to provide an option to return records that
either include or do not include an image of the prisoner. In
addition, the 2015 enhancement allowed PPD record short
summaries to accommodate more text as well as greater capacity
to link to external websites.
The PPD aims to provide a technology with sufficient power
to handle the scope and complexity of political imprisonment in
China. The most important feature of the PPD is that it is
structured as a genuine database and uses a powerful query
engine. Each prisoner's record describes the type of human
rights violation by Chinese authorities that led to his or her
detention. These types include violations of the right to
peaceful assembly, freedom of religion, freedom of association,
and freedom of expression, including the freedom to advocate
peaceful social or political change and to criticize government
policy or government officials.
The design of the PPD allows anyone with access to the
internet to query the database and download prisoner data
without providing personal information to the Commission, and
without the PPD downloading any software or web cookies to a
user's computer. Users have the option to create a user
account, which allows them to save, edit, and reuse queries,
but the PPD does not require a user to provide any personal
information to set up such an account. The PPD does not
download software or a web cookie to a user's computer as the
result of setting up such an account. Saved queries are not
stored on a user's computer. A user-specified ID (which can be
a nickname) and password are the only information required to
set up a user account.

Notes to Section I--Executive Summary
\1\ The Commission treats as a political prisoner an individual
detained or imprisoned for exercising his or her human rights under
international law, such as peaceful assembly, freedom of religion,
freedom of association, and freedom of expression, including the
freedom to advocate peaceful social or political change, and to
criticize government policy or government officials. (This list is
illustrative, not exhaustive.) In most cases, prisoners in the PPD were
detained or imprisoned for attempting to exercise rights guaranteed to
them by China's Constitution and law, or by international human rights
standards, or both. Chinese security, prosecution, and judicial
officials sometimes seek to distract attention from the political or
religious nature of imprisonment by convicting a de facto political or
religious prisoner under the pretext of having committed a generic
crime. In such cases, defendants typically deny guilt but officials may
attempt to coerce confessions using torture and other forms of abuse,
and standards of evidence are poor. A defendant may authorize someone
to provide him or her legal counsel and defense, as the PRC Criminal
Procedure Law guarantees in Article 32, yet officials may deny the
counsel adequate access to the defendant, restrict or deny the
counsel's access to evidence, and not provide the counsel adequate time
to prepare a defense.

II. Human Rights
Freedom of Expression
Findings
At the UN Human Rights Council's third
Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of China's compliance
with international human rights norms, non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) reported that the Chinese
government and Communist Party violated freedom of
expression and freedom of the press. The Office of the
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights apparently
removed information submitted by at least seven non-
governmental groups, among which were NGOs that
advocate for the rights of Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Hong
Kong people, from an official summary of UPR
submissions. That information from some of the missing
submissions was inserted in a supplement prior to the
November 2018 session did little to dispel stakeholder
concerns about Chinese government influence during the
UPR.
Conditions for journalism in China continued
to deteriorate. Some professional Chinese journalists
described current conditions for journalism as an ``era
of total censorship.'' In addition, the government's
ongoing crackdown continued against ``citizen
journalists'' who have founded or are associated with
websites that document human rights violations, as seen
in the detention of individuals focused on labor
conditions, such as Wei Zhili, Yang Zhengjun, and Ke
Chengbing. Foreign journalists faced multiple
challenges from the government, including surveillance;
harassment of Chinese nationals who work as news
assistants; limits on the length of work visas or visa
denial; and obstruction in the coverage of developments
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and
other ethnic minority or border areas.
The government and Party continued to link
internet security to national security. This past year,
authorities detained and prosecuted individuals who
criticized government officials and policies online,
and censored or distorted a range of news and
information that the government deemed ``politically
sensitive,'' including the 30th anniversary of the 1989
Tiananmen protests, the protests in Hong Kong against
proposed extradition legislation, and trade issues.
Declining academic freedom in China linked to
Party General Secretary and President Xi Jinping's
reassertion of ideological control over universities
was illustrated by reports of the internment of
hundreds of predominantly Uyghur scholars in mass
internment camps in the XUAR; the detention of
university students who advocated for labor rights; and
the dismissal, suspension, and other forms of
discipline imposed on faculty who criticized the
government and Party.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Give greater public expression, including at the
highest levels of the U.S. Government, to the issue of
press freedom in China, condemning the harassment and
detention of both domestic and foreign journalists; the
denial, threat of denial, or delay of visas for foreign
journalists; and the censoring or blocking of foreign
media websites. Consistently link press freedoms to
U.S. interests, noting how censorship and restrictions
on journalists and media websites prevent the free flow
of information on issues of public concern, including
public health and environmental crises, food safety
problems, and corruption, and act as trade barriers for
foreign media and companies attempting to access the
Chinese market. Raise these issues with Chinese
officials during bilateral dialogues. Assess the extent
to which China's treatment of foreign journalists
contravenes its World Trade Organization commitments
and other obligations.
Sustain, and where appropriate expand, programs that
develop and widely distribute technologies that will
assist Chinese human rights advocates and civil society
organizations in circumventing internet restrictions,
in order to access and share content protected under
international human rights standards. Continue to
maintain internet freedom programs for China at the
U.S. Department of State and the Broadcasting Board of
Governors to provide digital security training and
capacity-building efforts for bloggers, journalists,
civil society organizations, and human rights and
internet freedom advocates in China.
Raise with Chinese officials, during all appropriate
bilateral discussions, the cost to U.S.-China relations
and to the Chinese public's confidence in government
institutions that is incurred when the Chinese
government restricts political debate, advocacy for
democracy or human rights, and other forms of peaceful
political expression. Emphasize that such restrictions
violate international standards for free expression,
particularly those contained in Article 19 of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
and Article 19 of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights. Emphasize that such restrictions erode
confidence in media and government institutions.
Urge Chinese officials to end unlawful detention and
official harassment of Chinese rights advocates,
lawyers, and journalists subject to reprisal for
exercising their right to freedom of expression. Call
on officials to release or confirm the release of
individuals detained or imprisoned for exercising
freedom of expression, such as Liu Feiyue, Huang Qi,
Sun Lin, Zhang Haitao, Tashi Wangchug, Chai Xiaoming,
Wei Zhili, Ke Chengbing, Yang Zhengjun, Lu Guang, Yang
Hengjun, and other political prisoners mentioned in
this report and documented in the Commission's
Political Prisoner Database.

China's Compliance with International Standards on Freedom of
Expression
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year, the Chinese
government and Communist Party continued to restrict expression
in contravention of international human rights standards,\1\
including Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR) and Article 19 of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.\2\ According to the ICCPR--which
China signed in 1998 \3\ but has not ratified \4\--and as
reiterated in 2011 by the Special Rapporteur on the promotion
and protection of the right to freedom of opinion and
expression, countries may impose certain restrictions or
limitations on freedom of expression, if such restrictions are
provided by law and are necessary for the purpose of respecting
the ``rights or reputations of others'' or protecting national
security, public order, public health, or morals.\5\ An October
2009 UN Human Rights Council resolution specified that
restrictions on the ``discussion of government policies and
political debate,'' ``peaceful demonstrations or political
activities, including for peace or democracy,'' and
``expression of opinion and dissent'' are inconsistent with
Article 19(3) of the ICCPR.\6\ The UN Human Rights Committee
also cautioned that restrictions on freedom of expression noted
in Article 19(3) should be interpreted narrowly so that the
restrictions ``may not put in jeopardy the right itself.'' \7\
At the UN Human Rights Council's (HRC) third Universal
Periodic Review (UPR) of China's compliance with international
human rights norms this past year,\8\ international non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) reported multiple violations
of freedom of expression and press freedom in China in written
submissions \9\ available in the months prior to China's
November 2018 opening session and in oral comments at the March
2019 session to consider the HRC's report.\10\ NGO stakeholders
also raised concerns about efforts by the Chinese government to
silence criticism of its record during the UPR.\11\ In one
publicly reported incident, the Office of the UN High
Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) removed information
submitted by at least seven groups, among which were NGOs that
advocate for the rights of Tibetans, Uyghurs, and Hong Kong
people,\12\ from an initial official summary of stakeholder
submissions in September 2018,\13\ replacing that summary with
a revised version in October 2018.\14\ That information from
some but not all of the missing submissions was inserted in a
corrigendum issued a few days before the November session \15\
did little to dispel stakeholder concerns about Chinese
government influence.\16\ A coalition of 40 NGOs subsequently
called on HRC States Parties to adopt a resolution to ``express
collective concern about worsening rights abuse in China and
the government's failure to follow through on its obligations
and commitments.'' \17\
30 Years after Tiananmen
International coverage of the 30th anniversary of the
protests for political reform and democratic change in
Tiananmen Square, Beijing municipality, and hundreds of other
locations in China in the spring of 1989,\18\ provided new
accounts, images,\19\ and analysis of the Chinese Communist
Party and government's violent suppression of those
demonstrations on June 3 and 4, 1989 (``June Fourth'' or
``Tiananmen''). Among the highlights were a former military
journalist's account of opposition among some military leaders
to the use of force to quell the protests; \20\ a collection of
secret documents from a meeting of senior Party leaders from
June 19 to 21, 1989; \21\ and essays by younger Chinese
describing how they learned about June Fourth despite ongoing
government censorship.\22\ An academic analysis linked Party
General Secretary and President Xi Jinping's aggressive
policies of ideological conformity and information control,
Party discipline, and centralization of his own power to the
political legacy of June Fourth.\23\
China's Defense Minister Wei Fenghe spoke publicly about
Tiananmen in early June 2019, reiterating the official position
that the government's crackdown in 1989 was ``correct.'' \24\
Wei's use of ``political turmoil'' (zhengzhi dongluan) in these
comments reflected a revival of hardline official rhetoric on
Tiananmen, a ``regression'' from the comparatively mild
expressions commonly used in official statements such as
``political turbulence'' (zhengzhi fengbo) and the ``turn from
spring to summer'' (chunxia zhi jiao).\25\ Likewise, the July
2019 obituary for senior leader Li Peng in the state-run media
outlet Xinhua reiterated the harsher language: Xinhua commended
Li--the premier who declared martial law in Beijing in May 1989
\26\--for his staunch support of the ``resolute measures to
halt the turmoil [dongluan] and quell the counterrevolutionary
rebellion [fan'geming baoluan].'' \27\
The government's tight control of information about the use
of violence against protesters as well as the crackdown on
protesters has left much unknown about Tiananmen, particularly
the total number of dead and wounded. The Tiananmen Mothers
\28\--a group in China composed of parents and family members
of persons killed on or around June 4--wrote in March 2019 to
the National People's Congress, again appealing to the
government for truth, accountability, and a reckoning over the
victims.\29\ Through years of effort, the Tiananmen Mothers
have confirmed the deaths of 202 persons, but overall estimates
range from the hundreds to the thousands.\30\ Referring to
persons detained in connection to June Fourth, John Kamm, the
executive director of the U.S.-based Dui Hua Foundation, which
maintains an extensive database of political prisoners in
China,\31\ estimated some 15,000 detentions in a 2009 speech,
noting, ``Whatever the number is, it is staggeringly high.''
\32\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Press Freedom and Tiananmen
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the spring 1989 protests, freedom of expression was a key
demand among the student demonstrators,\33\ a demand also taken up by
Chinese journalists who petitioned the government for dialogue on press
freedom.\34\ Despite a hardline editorial in the Party mouthpiece
People's Daily on April 26, 1989, which condemned the student protests
as ``counterrevolutionary'' and ``turmoil,'' \35\ some official media
outlets reported on the demonstrations with a ``new openness'' and
accuracy in May 1989,\36\ including front-page coverage of the protests
across the country on May 6, 1989.\37\ Former People's Daily journalist
Liu Binyan \38\ reported in 1992 that a `` `dark age' once more
descended over the mass media'' after the military crackdown, with
increased ideological control over news content.\39\ Progress also
ended in the efforts to pass national press legislation in spite of
robust developments and drafting in the late 1980s.\40\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Freedom of the Press
China fell one place lower in Reporters Without Borders'
2019 press freedom index from its rank in 2018 (176th to
177th), making it the fourth worst country in the world for
press freedom.\41\ Some professional Chinese journalists
described current conditions for journalism as an ``era of
total censorship.'' \42\ A leading investigative journalist who
left the field in 2019 \43\ emphasized his disenchantment with
the practice of journalism in China.\44\ Freedom of the press
is guaranteed in China's Constitution,\45\ yet regulations on
news media, some related to the broad restrictions on internet
content in the PRC National Security Law and PRC Cybersecurity
Law, leave journalists vulnerable to criminal prosecution.\46\
The Chinese government's repression of Uyghur and other ethnic
minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR)
since 2017 has resulted in a significant increase in detained
journalists \47\ as well as editorial staff from at least one
leading newspaper and a publishing house.\48\ The November 2018
detention of photojournalist and U.S. resident Lu Guang in the
XUAR, while he was reportedly in Urumqi municipality to give a
photography workshop,\49\ and the January 2019 detention of
Australian national and political commentator Yang Hengjun,
while at the Guangdong international airport en route to
Shanghai municipality,\50\ heightened concerns about freedom of
speech and the press, and for the safety of individuals
traveling to China for personal or professional activity.\51\
PARTY CONTROL OF THE MEDIA
In January 2019, Party General Secretary Xi Jinping and
members of the Standing Committee of the Party Central
Committee Political Bureau visited People's Daily, the Party's
flagship newspaper, to publicize efforts by the news media to
keep up with emerging technologies of the digital era.\52\
These efforts--officially referred to as ``media convergence''
(meiti ronghe)--envisage a fusion of news media and digital
technologies,\53\ whereby ``Party newspapers, periodicals,
broadcast stations, websites `and other mainstream media must
catch up with the times, bravely utilizing new technologies,
new mechanisms and new modes, accelerating the pace of
convergence and achieving more expansive and optimized
propaganda results.' '' \54\ High-level promotion of ``media
convergence'' this past year occurred in tandem with government
entities responsible for news media moving under the Central
Propaganda Department's operations, part of a sweeping
reorganization of Party and government institutions in March
2018 that has reinforced Party power more broadly.\55\
Media serving ``as government mouthpieces instead of as
independent bodies operating in the public interest'' are a
major challenge to free expression, according to international
experts.\56\ The Chinese Communist Party historically
designated the Chinese news media as its ``mouthpiece,'' \57\
providing the Party's version of the news and shaping public
opinion.\58\ Official control included prohibitions on
independent reporting or use of foreign media reports, and
restricting coverage to ``authoritative'' content, typically
from the state media agency Xinhua and People's Daily.\59\
China Digital Times, a U.S.-based web portal that translates
leaked censorship directives from the Central Propaganda
Department and other government entities,\60\ highlighted
directives from the reporting year that restricted coverage of
the China-U.S. trade war and of high-ranking Chinese leaders,
among other issues authorities deemed ``politically
sensitive.'' \61\ In a related development, People's Daily
monetized its expertise in identifying ``politically
sensitive'' content by marketing the services of its in-house
censors \62\ and in formally training and certifying
censors.\63\
Wielding state media to positively portray the Party and
government \64\ as well as to criticize developments that
authorities consider to be security threats \65\ continues to
be a manifestation of the Party-defined ``mouthpiece'' role of
the news media. This past year, official coverage of Uyghurs
and other predominantly Muslim groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous Region, at least one million of whom have been
detained in mass internment camps for ``political
reeducation,'' reportedly portrayed the region as ``happy and
stable.'' \66\ Chinese state media also reportedly manipulated
information about the summer 2019 protests in Hong Kong, rather
than objectively reporting on protester grievances about the
eroding rule of law.\67\ State media, moreover, provided
negative coverage of the Hong Kong protests in its
international outlets, such as CGTN and China Daily, to
generate a counter-narrative to international media outlets'
coverage.\68\
CRIMINAL DETENTION AND PROSECUTION OF CITIZEN JOURNALISTS
This past year, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ)
ranked China in second place, after Turkey, for having the
highest number of detained journalists in the world,\69\ a
large number of whom can be classified as ``citizen
journalists.'' \70\ Citizen journalists in China cover issues
such as the treatment of ethnic minority groups, labor
protests, and rights defense activities,\71\ topics that the
government and Party restrict in official news outlets.\72\
Bitter Winter, an online magazine managed in Italy which
reports on religious freedom and human rights in China,\73\
described its contributors from China as amateurs, noting that
``only in a few cases [do] our reporters have professional
training in journalism . . ..'' \74\ CPJ identified 47
journalists in detention as of December 2018,\75\ and Reporters
Without Borders counted 111 detained journalists as of April
2019.\76\ Government control of court data, media censorship of
cases, obstruction by local law enforcement, and official
harassment of lawyers representing journalists contribute to
the challenge in assessing the total number of detentions.\77\
The ongoing crackdown on citizen journalists who have
founded or are associated with websites that document human
rights violations continued this past year, particularly in the
detention of individuals focused on labor conditions and
religious freedom. Authorities detained staff from two websites
that monitor worker rights' protections, including Shang Kai in
August 2018,\78\ Yang Zhengjun in January 2019,\79\ and Chai
Xiaoming,\80\ Wei Zhili, and Ke Chengbing in March 2019.\81\
Shang and Chai were former editors at Red Reference, a self-
described ``leftist'' website that expressed support for worker
efforts in 2018 to organize a union at the Jasic Technology
factory in Shenzhen municipality, Guangdong province.\82\ Yang,
Wei, and Ke worked at the website iLabour (Xin Shengdai),
highlighting inadequate labor conditions and occupational
health hazards such as pneumoconiosis.\83\ [For further
information on the Jasic crackdown and occupational health
hazards in China, see Section II--Worker Rights.] Between
August and December 2018, authorities also reportedly detained
45 Chinese contributors to Bitter Winter.\84\
Trials and sentencing proceeded against several citizen
journalists detained in 2016 \85\ and 2017 \86\ whom
authorities prosecuted on the charges ``inciting subversion of
state power,'' ``picking quarrels and provoking trouble,'' and
``illegally procuring state secrets for overseas entities.''
\87\ According to the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention,
the incitement and state secrets charges are ``vague and
broad,'' thus restricting the freedoms of expression and
association that are protected by international human rights
instruments.\88\ The Dui Hua Foundation noted similar concerns
about the lack of transparency in the charge ``illegally
procuring state secrets for overseas entities,'' and its misuse
to prosecute journalists, among others.\89\ Some citizen
journalists are vulnerable to abuse and maltreatment in
detention.\90\
Citizen journalist cases of concern from this past year
included the following:
Liu Feiyue, Civil Rights & Livelihood Watch
(CRLW). In January 2019, the Suizhou Municipal
Intermediate People's Court in Hubei province sentenced
Liu to five years' imprisonment and three years'
deprivation of political rights for ``inciting
subversion of state power.'' \91\ Liu's indictment
specified CRLW's reporting on human rights violations,
its annual report on rights defense and forced
psychiatric commitment, and its calls on authorities to
release political prisoners.\92\
Sun Lin, freelance writer. In January 2019,
the Nanjing Municipal Intermediate People's Court in
Jiangsu province sentenced Sun to four years'
imprisonment for ``inciting subversion of state power''
in connection to Sun's social media posts that
authorities apparently deemed ``politically
sensitive.'' \93\ Authorities previously sentenced Sun,
a former journalist for Nanjing media outlets, to four
years' imprisonment in June 2008, in connection to work
he published on an overseas website.\94\
Huang Qi, 64 Tianwang.\95\ On July 29, 2019,
the Mianyang Municipal Intermediate People's Court in
Sichuan province found Huang guilty of ``illegally
providing state secrets to overseas entities'' and
``intentionally leaking state secrets,'' sentencing him
to serve 12 years' imprisonment.\96\ In an editorial
following the sentence, the Washington Post noted, ``in
actuality, his only offense was speaking out against
government wrongdoing.'' \97\ Authorities also
continuously harassed and extralegally detained Huang's
85-year-old mother, Pu Wenqing,\98\ as she sought to
raise attention to reports that detention center
authorities have denied Huang adequate medical care,
tortured him, and refused her applications for his
medical parole.\99\
WORSENING WORKING CONDITIONS FOR FOREIGN JOURNALISTS
Official Chinese efforts to control coverage of China in
international news media reportedly intensified this past year,
increasing the difficulties for foreign journalists in China.
The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China (FCCC) annual survey
of working conditions in China described a marked deterioration
in 2018.\100\ The FCCC documented the Chinese government's
``escalation of human and digital'' surveillance of foreign
journalists; \101\ harassment of Chinese nationals who worked
as news assistants; \102\ threats against and harassment of
sources; \103\ limits on the length of work visas or denial of
work visa renewal altogether to retaliate against unfavorable
coverage by specific journalists or their news outlets; \104\
and interference in the coverage of developments in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) and other ethnic
minority or border areas of China.\105\ The Chinese government
also continued to block access in China to major international
news outlets,\106\ such as the New York Times,\107\ and
additional international news and online information sites were
censored by authorities around the Tiananmen anniversary,
including the Intercept, the Guardian,\108\ and Wikipedia.\109\
Incidents this past year of official control of foreign
journalists included the following:
Visa non-renewal or threat of withholding a
visa. In August 2018, Chinese authorities refused to
renew the work visa of Megha Rajagopalan,\110\ a
BuzzFeed reporter who described developments in the
XUAR as ``dystopian.'' \111\ In addition, authorities
did not issue a journalist visa to Bethany Allen-
Ebrahimian, who submitted an application in late 2018
to join Agence France-Presse in China.\112\ The
Committee to Protect Journalists called it ``an act of
retribution for her past reporting on the Chinese
government's efforts to spread political power abroad
and is a shameful attempt to prevent critical coverage
of China . . ..'' \113\ In another incident, Voice of
America reported in March 2019 that a Chinese embassy
official in Russia threatened to place a journalist
from Russia's Sputnik News on a visa ``blacklist'' in
connection to the journalist's alleged ``negative''
coverage of the Chinese economy.\114\ [For information
on the Hong Kong government's visa denial to Victor
Mallet, Asia editor of the Financial Times, see Section
VI--Developments in Hong Kong and Macau.]
Interference in the XUAR. FCCC also reported
instances of official harassment, surveillance, and
intimidation while foreign reporters were on assignment
in the XUAR in 2018.\115\ In April 2019, a New York
Times correspondent recounted both high-tech (digital)
and low-tech (human) surveillance of him and a
colleague while on assignment in the XUAR.\116\ [For
further information on official harassment of foreign
journalists in the XUAR, see Section IV--Xinjiang.]
Lack of access in the Tibet Autonomous Region
(TAR). Five respondents to the FCCC's annual working
conditions survey unsuccessfully applied to the Chinese
government for a special permit to visit the TAR in
2018.\117\ In a March 2019 position paper, the FCCC
emphasized that the Chinese government's restrictions
on access to the TAR and Tibetan areas in Qinghai,
Gansu, Sichuan, and Yunnan provinces has limited the
amount of ``accurate information'' on the ``lives of
ethnic Tibetans living in China.'' \118\
Internet and Social Media
During the 2019 reporting year, senior officials reiterated
the Party's aim to further secure Party control of digital
space and technologies. In September 2018, the newly appointed
head of the Cyberspace Administration of China, Zhuang Rongwen,
urged Party and government to marshal ``netizens'' (wangmin) as
a ``force'' (liliang) in Party control.\119\ As mentioned
earlier in this section, in January 2019, Party General
Secretary and President Xi Jinping called for even greater
uniformity on digital platforms through deeper ``convergence''
with the Party's ideological priorities.\120\ A key premise
underlying this aim is ``internet sovereignty,'' a notion the
Chinese government and Party have linked to national security
concerns such that each country may manage the internet within
its own borders.\121\ Internet sovereignty, however, implies
that internet and social media use in any individual country is
not subject to international standards on freedom of
expression, information, and association as they pertain to the
internet and social media.\122\
Content control remained a focus in the growing body of
internet and social media regulations and censorship
technologies.\123\ [For information on the role of internet
service providers in censorship, data privacy concerns, and
surveillance, see Section III--Business and Human Rights.]
These regulatory and technological developments, in combination
with provisions in the PRC Criminal Law that punish certain
political and other speech,\124\ severely curtailed freedom of
speech online,\125\ and included the detention and potential
criminal prosecution of individuals engaged in speech \126\ and
other forms of online expression authorities deem to be
``politically sensitive.'' \127\ The Cyberspace Administration
of China issued provisions for internet service providers in
November 2018,\128\ that one expert claimed will ``increase the
requirements for self-inspection for services with `public
opinion properties' or `social mobilization capacity.' '' \129\
Some experts have found that Chinese government censorship is
less motivated by preventing dissemination of sensitive content
than by a fear that online speech has the potential to
stimulate collective organizing.\130\ Other analysis,
nevertheless, questioned this interpretation, finding instead
that government criticism remains a central target of official
censorship within the complex operation of state repression in
China.\131\ Indeed, as Human Rights Watch researcher Yaqiu Wang
observed, the nationwide Twitter crackdown this past year
appeared ``absent any protests or other social events organized
via Twitter as a trigger, . . . signal[ing] a new level of
suppression of free speech . . ..'' \132\
Tiananmen anniversary.\133\ Official efforts
to suppress mention of Tiananmen online were
demonstrated by the government's ``simultaneous social
media crackdowns'' to stem access to information and
communication \134\ and blocking online access to
international media.\135\ At least one commentator
speculated that the Cybersecurity Association of
China's six-month campaign (January to June 2019) to
``clean up online ecology'' \136\ was linked to the
30th anniversary.\137\ According to research conducted
by the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab and the
University of Hong Kong's Weiboscope, June Fourth is
the most censored topic on the Chinese internet.\138\
During ten years of research, Citizen Lab collected a
list of 3,237 Tiananmen-related keywords that
apparently trigger censorship in China.\139\ Weiboscope
identified 1,256 Tiananmen-related posts censored
between 2012 and 2018, among which are images of a
single lit candle and the annual Tiananmen vigil held
in Hong Kong.\140\
Twitter crackdown. Reports began to emerge in
November 2018 that Chinese authorities were several
months into a coordinated, nationwide effort to silence
Twitter users in China.\141\ These Twitter users
included not only government critics and advocates for
greater rights protection but also individuals who
apparently were not politically active on- or
offline.\142\ Public security officials harassed and
intimidated targeted individuals, employing
interrogation, usually at a police station;
administrative or criminal detention; coercion to
compel a promise to no longer use Twitter; and deletion
of entire Twitter archives.\143\ Prior to the 30th
anniversary of Tiananmen, the social media company
Twitter reportedly suspended the accounts of at least
100 Twitter users, including political commentators and
nationalists,\144\ which it later claimed was part of
routine maintenance and not in response to Chinese
authorities.\145\
Criminal prosecution--``June Fourth liquor''
case. In April 2019, the Chengdu Municipal Intermediate
People's Court in Sichuan province tried and sentenced
four men involved in the ``June Fourth liquor''
case.\146\ Authorities accused them of posting photos
online of the self-made labels they placed on bottles
of hard liquor in 2016, which memorialized June Fourth
by using a product name homophonous with the date ``89/
6/4,'' an image modeled on the well-known ``Tank Man''
photo, and promotional language that said ``Never
forget, Never give up.'' \147\
Curtailment of Academic Freedom in China
Domestic and international experts have linked the
widespread deterioration of academic freedom in China to Party
General Secretary and President Xi Jinping's reassertion of
ideological control over universities since he assumed the
senior-most Party and government leadership positions in 2012
and 2013, respectively.\148\ Around politically sensitive
anniversaries this past year, such as the 100th anniversary of
the 1919 May Fourth Movement and the 30th anniversary of the
1989 Tiananmen protests, authorities also increased pressure at
Chinese universities,\149\ such that some Chinese scholars
reportedly have asserted that the ``current [academic]
environment is the most restrictive in their lifetimes.'' \150\
Reports this past year demonstrated a broad range of official
repression, including the following:
Detention or disappearance of 435 prominent
Uyghur scholars in mass internment camps by authorities
in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) as part
of the government and Party's massive crackdown on
Uyghur and other ethnic minority groups in the XUAR
since 2017, according to a Uyghur rights advocacy
organization.\151\ Authorities also have detained
scholars from other ethnic minority groups in the XUAR;
\152\
Interrogation, forced videotaped confessions,
and in some cases detention of 20 student labor rights
advocates and participants of on-campus ``leftist''
study groups by authorities,\153\ including Peking
University students Qiu Zhanxuan \154\ and Yue Xin;
\155\
Intensified promotion of ideological and
``patriotic'' education in the classroom; \156\
Book bans,\157\ such as leading law scholar
Zhang Qianfan's textbook on constitutional law; \158\
A leadership change at Peking University that
apparently emphasized Party and public security
credentials over academic qualifications; \159\
Discipline, suspension, and dismissal of
professors who publicly aired critical assessments of
the government or Party,\160\ notably Tsinghua
University law professor Xu Zhangrun; \161\
Widespread use of surveillance cameras in
classrooms to monitor discussion as well as the
encouragement of students to report professors or
classmates with dissenting views; \162\
Pressure on domestic academic experts who have
been contacted by foreign journalists or scholars for
interviews and commentary either to refuse such
requests or restrict the ``candor'' of their comments;
\163\ and
Prevention of Chinese academics and others
from participating in academic exchange and
travel,\164\ such as rights lawyer Chen Jiangang's
April 2019 travel to the United States to begin a
Humphrey Fellowship.\165\
The government and Party's restrictions on academic and
intellectual freedom in China also compounded concerns in the
United States about international scholarly exchange with
China. A report from leading China specialists highlighted the
lack of reciprocity and accountability in academic exchange as
a factor for the report's policy guidance that recommended a
shift away from engagement in U.S.-China relations to the more
cautious ``constructive vigilance.'' \166\ In October 2018,
Cornell University emphasized violations of academic freedom
when it suspended two exchange programs with Renmin University
(Renda) in Beijing municipality following reports that Renda
officials had harassed students advocating for worker
rights.\167\ The Commission also observed reports of alleged
Chinese government harassment taking place outside mainland
China involving two foreign specialists (one incident in Hong
Kong and multiple incidents in New Zealand) whose work has been
critical of the Chinese leadership.\168\ The Chinese government
also denied a visa to one American expert to attend a
conference in Beijing.\169\ While known cases of outright visa
denial to foreign scholars whose research or publications are
deemed by Chinese authorities to be ``politically sensitive''
remain limited,\170\ the threat of visa denial is a
longstanding concern of foreign scholars.\171\ Foreign scholars
also have pointed to difficulties accessing archives and
libraries,\172\ the culling of digital archives and Chinese
government censorship demands on foreign academic
publishers,\173\ and limitations on conducting field work in
China.\174\ Accurate data on the frequency and substance of
such incidents, nevertheless, are difficult to obtain.\175\

journalists'' are ``a breed of self-taught activists who used the newly
emerging digital technologies to record interviews and post them
online, thus bypassing--for about a decade starting in the early

journalism.

Worker Rights
Worker Rights
Worker Rights
Findings
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year,
Chinese authorities severely restricted the ability of
civil society organizations to work on labor issues,
expanding a crackdown on labor advocates across China.
As of August 2019, over 50 workers and labor advocates
were under some form of detention in connection with
the crackdown.
The Chinese Communist Party-led All-China
Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) remains the only
trade union organization permitted under Chinese law,
and workers are not permitted to establish independent
unions. In November 2018, Chinese authorities detained
two local-level ACFTU officials, Zou Liping and Li Ao,
who attempted to assist workers at a Jasic Technology
factory in Shenzhen municipality, Guangdong province,
in setting up an ACFTU union.
The Chinese government did not publicly report
the number of worker strikes and protests, and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) and citizen
journalists continued to face difficulties in obtaining
comprehensive information on worker actions. The Hong
Kong-based NGO China Labour Bulletin (CLB), which
compiles data on worker actions collected from
traditional news sources and social media, documented
1,702 strikes and other worker actions in 2018, up from
1,257 incidents in 2017. In 2018, almost half (44.8
percent) of the worker actions documented by CLB were
in the construction sector, although significant
incidents were documented by workers at a recycling
company, food delivery workers, and factory workers in
the manufacturing sector.
In March 2019, Chinese internet technology
workers launched a campaign against exploitative work
hours--referred to as ``996,'' a 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
schedule for six days a week common in many technology
companies. The campaign, described by an American tech
worker advocate as ``the largest demonstration of
collective action the tech world has ever seen,''
posted a list of companies, including Huawei and
Alibaba, that reportedly require their employees to
follow the 996 schedule. Jack Ma, the founder of
Alibaba called the 996 schedule ``a blessing,'' and
some Chinese companies blocked access to the software
development platform Github, a Microsoft subsidiary,
where tech workers first posted the campaign.
During this reporting year, international
media documented the use of forced labor associated
with mass internment camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous Region (XUAR). Based on personal accounts,
analysis of satellite imagery, and official documents,
the New York Times documented a number of new factories
in or nearby the camps, and the Associated Press
tracked shipments from one of these factories to a
U.S.-based company Badger Sportswear.
In March 2019, following a chemical explosion
that killed 78 people in Jiangsu province, the largest
industrial accident in China since a 2015 industrial
explosion in Tianjin municipality killed 173 people,
the UN special rapporteur on human rights and toxics
stated that, ``China's repeated promises on chemical
safety must be followed by meaningful action and
lasting measures if it is to meet its human rights
obligations.''
In 2019, Chinese authorities detained three
citizen journalists from the iLabour (Xin Shengdai)
website--Yang Zhengjun, Ke Chengbing, and Wei Zhili--as
well as NGO worker Li Dajun, all of whom had advocated
on behalf of pneumoconiosis victims.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Press the Chinese government to immediately release
labor advocates and journalists who are in prison or
detention for the exercise of their lawful rights and
to stop censoring economic and labor reporting.
Specifically, consider raising the following cases:
Detained NGO staff and labor advocates,
including Fu Changguo and Zhang Zhiyu (more
widely known as Zhang Zhiru);
Citizen journalists and NGO workers who had
advocated on behalf of pneumoconiosis victims,
including Yang Zhengjun, Ke Chengbing, Wei
Zhili, and Li Dajun;
Detained factory worker advocates from Jasic
Technology in Shenzhen municipality, Guangdong
province, including Mi Jiuping and Liu Penghua;
Detained university students and recent
graduates, including Yue Xin and Qiu Zhanxuan;
and
Detained local-level ACFTU officials Zou
Liping and Li Ao who supported grassroots
worker organizing efforts.
Call on the Chinese government to respect
internationally recognized rights to freedom of
association and collective bargaining, and allow
workers to organize and establish independent labor
unions. Raise concern in all appropriate trade
negotiations and bilateral and multilateral dialogues
about the Chinese Communist Party's role in collective
bargaining and elections of trade union
representatives, emphasizing that in a market economy,
wage rates should be determined by free bargaining
between labor and management.
Call on the Chinese government to permit academic
freedom on university campuses in China, and stop the
harassment, surveillance, and detention of students who
support worker rights.
Call on the Chinese government to end the use of
forced labor associated with the mass internment camps
in the XUAR.
Promote and support bilateral and multilateral
exchanges among government officials, academics, legal
experts, and civil society groups to focus on labor
issues such as freedom of expression, collective
bargaining, employment discrimination, and occupational
health and safety. Seek opportunities to support
capacity-building programs to strengthen Chinese labor
and legal aid organizations defending the rights of
workers.
When appropriate, integrate meaningful civil society
participation into bilateral and multilateral
dialogues, meetings, and exchanges. Invite
international unions and labor NGOs as well as domestic
civil society groups from all participating countries
to observe relevant government-to-government dialogues.
Encourage compliance with fundamental International
Labour Organization (ILO) conventions. Request that the
ILO increase its work monitoring core labor standards
in China, including freedom of association and the
right to organize.
Worker Rights
Worker Rights
Worker Rights
Trade Unions and Collective Bargaining
The Chinese government and Communist Party's laws and
practices continue to contravene international worker rights
standards, including the right to create or join independent
trade unions.\1\ The Party-led All-China Federation of Trade
Unions (ACFTU) remains the only trade union organization
permitted under Chinese law.\2\ The ACFTU's submission to the
November 2018 session of the UN Human Rights Council's
Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the Chinese government's
human rights record claimed that it had 303 million members,\3\
including 140 million migrant workers.\4\ Based on a National
Bureau of Statistics of China survey,\5\ however, the Hong
Kong-based non-governmental organization (NGO) China Labour
Bulletin concluded that around 80 percent of the migrant
members of the ACFTU were not aware of their membership.\6\ In
2018, 288.36 million out of 775.86 million employed Chinese
were migrant workers,\7\ individuals with rural household
registration but who work and reside in urban areas without
access to most government benefits.\8\ Scholars and
international observers noted that the ACFTU typically
prioritized Party interests over the interests of workers and
did not effectively represent workers.\9\ In November 2018, at
the 17th National Congress of the ACFTU, held once every five
years, Wang Dongming, the ACFTU Chairman and a Vice Chairman of
the National People's Congress Standing Committee, emphasized
that the ACFTU should be loyal to the Party.\10\ At the
enterprise level, union representatives often side with
management interests.\11\ Provisions in the PRC Labor Law, PRC
Labor Contract Law, and PRC Trade Union Law provide a legal
framework for negotiating collective contracts,\12\ but these
laws designate the Party-controlled ACFTU as responsible for
negotiating with employers and signing collective contracts on
behalf of workers.\13\ Restrictions on workers' rights to
freely establish and join independent trade unions violate
international standards set forth by the International Labour
Organization (ILO),\14\ Universal Declaration of Human
Rights,\15\ International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights,\16\ and the International Covenant on Economic, Social
and Cultural Rights.\17\ As a member of the ILO, China is
obligated to respect workers' right to collective
bargaining.\18\
Heightened Suppression of Labor Rights Advocacy
The Hong Kong Confederation of Trade Unions, which
participated in an October 2018 pre-session to the UPR,
summarized that labor rights in China have ``deteriorated
significantly in recent years'' and that authorities have
increased efforts to ``quell labor [unrest] by coercive
means.'' \19\ During the Commission's 2019 reporting year,
Chinese authorities expanded a nationwide crackdown on labor
advocates, following authorities' detention of workers and
their supporters at a Jasic Technology factory in Shenzhen
municipality, Guangdong province, beginning in July 2018.\20\
According to the China Labor Crackdown Concern Group, an
organization made up of concerned individuals in mainland China
and abroad, as of August 2019, over 50 of the 130 labor
advocates detained since July 2018 remain missing or in
custody,\21\ and beginning in January 2019, ``[s]ocial work
organizations and labour rights activists at large have become
targets.'' \22\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Jasic Incident
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In July 2018, factory workers Mi Jiuping and Liu Penghua obtained
signatures from 89 of approximately 1,000 employees at Jasic
Technology, a company in Shenzhen municipality, Guangdong province,
that manufactures industrial equipment, in support of organizing a
union.\23\ Local-level ACFTU officials had initially supported worker
efforts to organize a union,\24\ but later that month, Guangdong
authorities in Guangdong province detained around 30 people including
Mi and Liu.\25\ The Jasic incident was distinct from the thousands of
other worker actions in 2018,\26\ because self-described Maoist and
Marxist university students and recent graduates organized in support
of the workers.\27\ In August 2018, authorities detained about 50 of
the student and recent graduate supporters, including Peking University
graduate and outspoken women's rights advocate Yue Xin, who had
traveled to Guangdong.\28\ Police and university officials also
monitored and harassed individuals involved in labor advocacy on
college campuses.\29\ In October, Cornell University's School of
Industrial and Labor Relations suspended two student exchange programs
with Renmin University in Beijing municipality due to ``gross
violations of academic freedom'' \30\ after university officials--
reportedly at the direction of the Communist Party--harassed,
threatened, and surveilled student supporters of the Jasic workers.\31\
In November, authorities detained at least 12 additional supporters of
the Jasic workers' labor advocacy,\32\ and two local-level ACFTU
officials, Zou Liping and Li Ao, who had assisted the workers' attempts
to establish a union.\33\ As of May 2019, Chinese authorities had
detained 21 members of the Marxist society at Peking University,
including the group's leader Qiu Zhanxuan.\34\ In May, the labor
scholars who edit Made in China Journal, a publication supported in
part by the Australian National University, wrote that there is a ``. .
. serious moral and political issue for those Western universities that
collaborate with academic institutions . . . that blatantly and
unapologetically collude with Chinese authorities to suppress student
activists.'' \35\ [For more information on academic freedom in China,
see Section II--Freedom of Expression.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Civil Society Organizations
This past year, Chinese authorities severely restricted the
ability of civil society organizations to work on labor issues
and expanded a crackdown on labor advocates across China.\36\
Labor NGOs have been active in China since the mid-1990s,\37\
and had even advised workers on collective bargaining and other
rights advocacy beginning around 2002.\38\ Following an earlier
crackdown on labor advocates that began in 2015,\39\ Chinese
labor NGOs have been less active, and the work of some labor
NGOs has become more service-oriented.\40\ In 2019, Chinese
authorities continued to crack down on labor advocates,
including Wu Guijun, He Yuancheng, and Song Jiahui.\41\ Between
August 2018 and July 2019, authorities detained 22 individuals
working with 10 different labor NGOs or social service
centers,\42\ including from the following organizations:
Dagongzhe Migrant Workers Center (Dagongzhe
Zhongxin). In August 2018, authorities in Shenzhen
municipality, Guangdong province, detained Dagongzhe
staff Fu Changguo and Huang Qingnan on suspicion of
aiding Jasic workers with foreign financial
support.\43\
Red Reference (Hongse Cankao). In August 2018,
authorities in Beijing municipality searched the office
of this leftist website and detained staff member Shang
Kai.\44\ In March 2019, authorities in Nanjing
municipality, Jiangsu province, placed former editor
Chai Xiaoming under ``residential surveillance in a
designated location'' on suspicion of ``subversion of
state power.'' \45\
Qingying Dreamworks (Qingying Meng Gongchang).
In November 2018, Shenzhen authorities detained seven
individuals associated with Qingying Dreamworks, a non-
profit center providing workers' services in a
neighborhood with many migrant workers: co-founders
Wang Xiangyi and He Pengchao; staff members Jian
Xiaowei, Kang Yanyan, Hou Changshan, Wang Xiaomei; and
supporter He Xiumei.\46\ As of June 2019, these
individuals were still missing.\47\
Chunfeng Labor Dispute Center (Chunfeng
Laodong Zhengyi Fuwu Bu). In January 2019, Shenzhen
authorities detained founder Zhang Zhiyu (more widely
known as Zhang Zhiru) and former staff Jian Hui from
Chunfeng Labor Dispute Center, which provided legal
assistance to workers.\48\ Authorities held Zhang on
suspicion of ``disturbing public order.'' \49\ In 2014,
Party-run Global Times described Zhang as ``one of
China's top defenders of labor rights.'' \50\
iLabour (Xin Shengdai). In January 2019,
authorities in Guangzhou municipality, Guangdong,
detained Yang Zhengjun,\51\ the editor-in-chief of the
labor advocacy website iLabour (Xin Shengdai), and in
March, authorities in Guangzhou detained two other
editors, Ke Chengbing \52\ and Wei Zhili.\53\ The
iLabour website reported on worker rights issues in
China, including the health hazard pneumoconiosis.\54\
Authorities held the editors on suspicion of ``picking
quarrels and provoking trouble.'' \55\
In May 2019, during three separate raids,\56\ Chinese
authorities detained social workers from the following
organizations that assisted migrant workers:
Hope Community (Lengquan Xiwang Shequ).
Beijing authorities detained Li Dajun, director of Hope
Community.\57\
Qinghu Social Learning Center (Qinghu Shequ
Xuetang). Shenzhen authorities detained center director
Li Changjiang.\58\
Guangdong Mumian Social Work Service Center
(Guangdong Mumian Shehui Fuwu Gongzuo Zhongxin).
Guangzhou authorities detained Tsinghua University
post-doctoral researcher and Mumian volunteer Liang
Zicun.\59\
Domestic labor advocates' connections to foreign groups and
funding were reportedly of particular concern to authorities.
In January 2019, for example, Party-run Global Times reported
that Dagongzhe Migrant Workers Center was ``fully funded by
overseas NGOs,'' and ``instigating [labor] incidents and
coercing some workers into taking radical actions.'' \60\ Also
in January, Chinese authorities forced some student labor
advocates to watch videotaped confessions of other students in
which they may have been forced to admit to, among other
things, ``working with foreign forces to hurt China's
international image.'' \61\ [For more information on civil
society in China, see Section II--Civil Society.]
Worker Strikes and Protests
The Chinese government did not publicly report on the
number of worker strikes and protests, and NGOs that work on
labor issues continued to face difficulties in obtaining
comprehensive information on worker actions.\62\ Lu Yuyu, a
citizen journalist who posted data about social unrest--
including labor protests--on social media platforms, continued
to serve a four-year sentence in Yunnan province.\63\ China
Labour Bulletin (CLB), which compiles data on worker actions
collected from traditional news sources and social media,\64\
documented 1,702 strikes and other labor actions in 2018, up
from 1,257 strikes and other labor actions in 2017.\65\ The
majority of the labor actions documented by CLB were small in
scale: in 2018, 1,524 incidents (89.5 percent) involved fewer
than 100 people, and 163 (9.6 percent) involved over 1,000
people, including 13 with over 10,000 people (0.8 percent).\66\
In 2018, police were involved in 267 of the total incidents
(15.7 percent), although police were involved in over half (7
out of 13 protests) of the incidents involving over 1,000
people.\67\ During this reporting year, wage arrears in China
were a problem due in part to the continued refusal of
employers to give workers contracts,\68\ and in 2018, 1,342
strikes and other labor actions (78.7 percent) involved wage
arrears.\69\

Source: China Labour Bulletin. Note that the percentages indicate the percentage of total worker actions
documented that year. CLB changed their methodology beginning in 2017.
Chinese law does not protect workers' right to strike,\71\
contravening the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights, which China has signed and ratified.\72\
Examples of strikes and worker actions this past year
included the following:
Temporary Workers. In November 2018, reports
indicated that hundreds to thousands of temporary
workers protested outside of a Biel Crystal factory, a
major supplier for Apple and Samsung, in Huizhou
municipality, Guangdong province, after the factory
reportedly laid off 8,000 people due to poor sales of
Apple's iPhone.\73\
Independent Contractors. In February 2019,
food delivery drivers for online food delivery
companies Meituan and Ele.me went on strike in four
cities after the companies significantly reduced
delivery rates for drivers.\74\
Wage Arrears and Bankruptcy. In April 2019,
over 1,000 workers at Little Yellow Dog Environmental
Protection, a recycling company, protested in at least
four cities after the company announced that it would
not be able to pay workers.\75\ According to CLB, the
local labor bureau in Dongguang municipality,
Guangdong, did not support an arbitration request filed
by the workers.\76\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
996.ICU Campaign and Excessive Overtime
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In March 2019, Chinese internet technology workers launched a campaign
against exploitative working hours, protesting ``996''--a 9 a.m. to 9
p.m. schedule for six days a week common in many technology
companies.\77\ Chinese labor laws generally require that work schedules
not exceed 8 hours per day or 44 hours per week,\78\ with overtime
limited to 3 hours per day and 36 hours per month.\79\ The campaign
began as a project on the software development platform Github,\80\ a
subsidiary of Microsoft; the campaign identified labor law provisions
that the schedule violates.\81\ The campaign posted a list of
companies, including Huawei and Alibaba, that reportedly require their
workers to adhere to the 996 schedule.\82\ According to an American
tech worker advocate, the campaign was ``the largest demonstration of
collective action the tech world has ever seen,'' \83\ as the project
received over 200,000 ``stars'' indicating support.\84\ Jack Ma, the
founder of Alibaba, called the 996 schedule ``a blessing,'' \85\ and
some Chinese companies blocked access to Github.\86\ In April, two
Chinese programmers released an ``anti-996'' license for open source
software that requires any individual or company using the licensed
software to comply with all applicable labor laws and international
labor standards.\87\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Social Insurance
The majority of workers in China continued to lack social
insurance coverage. According to the PRC Social Insurance Law,
workers are entitled to five forms of social insurance: basic
pension insurance, health insurance, work-related injury
insurance, unemployment insurance, and maternity insurance.\88\
Under the law, employers and workers are required to contribute
to basic pension, health, and unemployment insurance; in
addition, employers are required to contribute to work-related
injury and maternity insurance on behalf of workers.\89\
According to the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS),
in 2018, the number of people covered by work-related injury
insurance coverage increased by 11.45 million to a total of
238.68 million for a coverage rate of 30.8 percent.\90\
Similarly, NBS reported that work-related injury insurance
coverage increased for migrant workers by 2.78 million people
to 80.85 million, for a coverage rate of 28.0 percent.\91\
Unemployment and maternity insurance coverage rates increased
slightly to 25.3 percent and 26.3 percent, respectively for all
workers.\92\ In July 2018, the central government established a
central adjustment fund to shift some pension funds from
wealthier provinces to provinces with more retirees.\93\ The
Ministry of Finance reported that in 2019, central authorities
planned to collect and redistribute a total of 484.5 billion
yuan (US$72 billion),\94\ with Guangdong province expected to
provide a net contribution of 47.4 billion yuan and Beijing
municipality a net contribution of 26.3 billion yuan, while
Liaoning and Heilongjiang provinces are expected to receive net
distributions of 21.6 billion yuan and 18.4 billion yuan,
respectively.\95\
Employment Relationships
This past year, several categories of workers were unable
to benefit fully from protections provided under Chinese law.
The PRC Labor Law and PRC Labor Contract Law only apply to
workers who have an ``employment relationship'' (laodong
guanxi) with their employers.\96\
DISPATCH LABOR AND CONTRACT LABOR
The Commission continued to observe reports of dispatch
labor (laowu paiqian) and contract worker (waibao) abuses
during this reporting year, in violation of domestic laws and
regulations.\97\ Firms, including state-owned enterprises, have
long used dispatch labor--workers hired through subcontracting
agencies--to cut costs,\98\ and some firms have replaced
dispatch labor with contract labor to further reduce costs.\99\
For example, in September and October 2018, former dispatch
workers at the Sino-German automobile joint venture FAW-
Volkswagen in Changchun municipality, Jilin province, protested
after management ended its reliance on dispatch workers, but
then made employees choose to either become formal employees at
lower pay or accept more tenuous employment as contract
workers.\100\ In January 2019, the state-backed media outlet
Sixth Tone reported on contract workers who were employed at a
Protek factory in Shanghai municipality--a site that assembled
Apple iPhones.\101\ Employees there protested after learning
that they would not be paid promised bonuses.\102\ The PRC
Labor Contract Law stipulates that dispatch workers shall be
paid the same as full-time workers doing similar work, and may
only perform work on a temporary, auxiliary, or substitute
basis.\103\
INTERN LABOR
During this reporting year, reports continued to emerge of
labor abuses involving vocational school students working at
school-arranged ``internships.'' In October 2018, the Hong
Kong-based NGO Students and Scholars Against Corporate
Misbehavior released a report on the widespread use of 16- to
19-year-old student interns in Chongqing municipality who were
forced to work 12-hour shifts on production lines as part of
compulsory internships.\104\ In November 2018, the Financial
Times reported that hundreds of students in Beijing
municipality and Kunshan city, Shandong province, were required
to complete mandatory internships during which they had to work
up to 18 hours a day at below minimum wage sorting and packing
goods for the Chinese e-commerce company JD.com.\105\ In August
2019, China Labor Watch published a report on labor violations
at Hengyang Foxconn in Hunan province, which included required
overtime for interns at a facility that manufactures products
for Amazon.\106\ Regulations prohibit interns from working
overtime and require internships to be relevant to students'
plans of study.\107\
FORCED LABOR
This past year, international media reported on the use of
forced labor associated with mass internment camps in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). In December 2018,
based on personal accounts, analysis of satellite imagery, and
official documents, the New York Times documented a number of
new factories in or nearby the camps,\108\ and the Associated
Press tracked shipments from one of these factories to a U.S.-
based company Badger Sportswear.\109\ In March 2019, the State
Council Information Office issued a white paper acknowledging
that certain products were being made in the camps.\110\ In May
2019, a Wall Street Journal report found that the supply chains
for a number of additional international companies may involve
forced labor in the XUAR, including Adidas, Kraft Heinz, Coca-
Cola, and Gap.\111\ [For more information on forced labor in
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, see Section II--Human
Trafficking, and Business and Human Rights; and Section IV--
Xinjiang.]
WORKERS ABOVE THE RETIREMENT AGE
Chinese workers above the legal retirement age continued to
lack certain legal protections afforded to other workers under
Chinese law, as the number of elderly workers increased.\112\
According to the PRC Labor Contract Law and the law's
implementing regulations, once workers reach retirement age or
receive pensions, their labor contracts are terminated by
operation of law.\113\ The inability of workers over the
retirement age to establish a formal employment relationship
with their employers leaves them without the protections
provided for in Chinese labor laws in cases of work-related
injury, unpaid overtime, or other labor issues.\114\ [For more
information on China's aging population, see Section II--
Population Control.]
Work Safety and Industrial Accidents
During this reporting year, government data showed a
continued decline in workplace deaths, although Chinese workers
and labor organizations expressed concerns about inadequate
safety equipment and training. According to the National Bureau
of Statistics of China (NBS), a total of 34,046 people died in
workplace accidents in 2018,\115\ compared to 37,852 deaths in
2017.\116\ According to one labor expert, however, the actual
number of deaths ``may be much higher, because incidents
involving few deaths often go unreported.'' \117\ In 2018,
there were 333 officially reported coal mining deaths, a major
decrease from recent years, although according to China Labour
Bulletin, ``the decline in accident and death rates . . . has
far more to do with mine closures and the falling demand for
coal . . . than the introduction of any new safety measures.''
\118\
Management of Chinese companies and factories often did not
provide adequate safety equipment or required safety training.
In April 2019, for example, a migrant construction worker in
Qingdao municipality, Shandong province, claimed that he was
fired after he filmed and posted a video online that showed the
low quality of safety helmets that the company had allegedly
provided to workers.\119\ In response to the video, which
received over two million views, the Ministry of Emergency
Management (MEM) posted a message on Weibo, China's Twitter-
like microblogging platform, which said that the realization of
safe production relies on workers having safe helmets, and that
[MEM] should pay more attention to safety measures in practice
rather than what the companies say about those measures.\120\
In a December 2018 report entitled, ``A Nightmare for Workers:
Appalling Conditions in Toy Factories Persist,'' New York City-
based China Labor Watch (CLW) detailed conditions in four
factories that make toys for Hasbro, Disney, and Mattel, brands
that are sold in Walmart, Costco, and Target,\121\ including
inadequate pre-job safety training and inadequate safety
equipment.\122\ In March 2019, CLW published a report on
Dongguan Dongwon Electronics, a factory in Dongguan
municipality, Guangdong province, that manufactures Samsung
mobile phone chargers, which described, among other violations
of Chinese law, a lack of pre-job safety training.\123\
The Chinese government's ineffective enforcement of work
safety regulations may also have contributed to a significant
industrial accident.\124\ On March 22, 2019, an explosion at
Jiangsu Tianjiayi Chemical plant in Yancheng city, Jiangsu
province, killed 78 people, injured 640, destroyed 16 nearby
factories, and forced the evacuation of almost 3,000
people.\125\ This explosion was the largest industrial accident
since a 2015 explosion in Tianjin municipality killed 173
people.\126\ Between 2016 and 2018, Chinese authorities had
issued 5 administrative fines against the chemical plant,\127\
and in February 2018, the State Administration of Work Safety
had identified 13 production-related hazards at the
facility.\128\ Following the explosion, the UN special
rapporteur on human rights and toxics declared that, ``China's
repeated promises on chemical safety must be followed by
meaningful action and lasting measures if it is to meet its
human rights obligations.'' \129\ [For more information on the
Jiangsu Tianjiayi Chemical plant explosion, see Section II--The
Environment and Climate Change.]
Occupational Health
The Chinese government reported a decrease in the number of
cases of occupational disease. In May 2019, the National Health
Commission reported that there were 23,497 cases of
occupational disease reported in 2018,\130\ compared to 26,756
cases in 2017 \131\ and 31,789 cases in 2016.\132\ Of the
occupational disease cases in 2018, 19,468 were work-related
cases of the lung disease pneumoconiosis.\133\ In January 2019,
however, National Health Commission research acknowledged that
the documented number of pneumoconiosis cases was only ``the
tip of the iceberg.'' \134\
This past year, protesters from Hunan province who demanded
compensation demonstrated the difficulties that pneumoconiosis
victims face in obtaining the official recognition required to
obtain workers' compensation.\135\ In November 2018,
approximately 200 retired migrant construction workers from
Hunan traveled to Shenzhen municipality, Guangdong, continuing
a long-term campaign to seek compensation for pneumoconiosis,
which they asserted was caused by their earlier work in
Guangdong.\136\ After Shenzhen police used pepper spray on the
retired workers on November 7, authorities agreed to provide
limited compensation to the workers, most of whom had never
signed labor contracts.\137\ In 2019, Chinese authorities
detained three citizen journalists from the iLabour (Xin
Shengdai) website, Yang Zhengjun, Ke Chengbing, and Wei
Zhili,\138\ as well as NGO worker Li Dajun, all of whom had
advocated on behalf of pneumoconiosis victims.\139\

Findings
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year,
Chinese government and Communist Party officials
continued to abuse criminal law and police power to
punish government critics and to ``maintain stability''
(weiwen) with the goal of perpetuating one-party rule.
The Chinese government in many cases violated the
freedoms of Chinese citizens protected under PRC laws
and international human rights standards, and used
criminal law to target rights advocates, religious
believers, and ethnic minority groups.
Authorities continued to use various forms of
arbitrary detention--such as extralegal ``black jails''
and forced psychiatric commitment of individuals
without mental illness--to deprive individuals of their
liberty, contravening international human rights
standards. Authorities also continued to use
administrative detention that circumvented judicial
oversight and protections for detainees' rights under
the PRC Criminal Procedure Law (CPL).
Authorities continued to detain individuals
under broad provisions in the PRC Criminal Law--such as
crimes of ``endangering state security,'' ``picking
quarrels and provoking trouble,'' and ``organizing and
using a cult organization to undermine implementation
of the law''--to suppress rights advocacy and other
activities protected under international human rights
standards.
Authorities held rights advocates, lawyers,
petitioners, and others in prolonged pretrial
detention, including under ``residential surveillance
at a designated location'' (RSDL), a form of
incommunicado detention that can last up to six months,
restricts access to counsel, and places detainees at
risk of abuse by authorities.
In one case with numerous human rights
violations, Falun Gong practitioner Sun Qian said that
she was tortured while in custody, subjected to
arbitrary and prolonged pretrial detention, and
prevented from obtaining proper legal counsel. In other
cases, officials denied detainees access to counsel,
such as human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang who was
prevented from seeing lawyers appointed by his wife.
In December 2018, Chinese authorities
separately detained Canadian citizens Michael Spavor
and Michael Kovrig for allegedly ``endangering state
security.'' In the same month, during a retrial, the
Dalian Intermediate People's Court sentenced to death
Canadian Robert Schellenberg for drug smuggling.
Observers believed these actions within the criminal
justice system were likely Chinese authorities' attempt
to exert pressure on the Canadian government for the
arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial executive
of the Chinese technology company Huawei, whom Canadian
authorities detained in December 2018 based on an
extradition request made by the U.S. Department of
Justice.
Authorities continued to torture and otherwise
abuse detainees:
Authorities denied requests to release human
rights website 64 Tianwang founder Huang Qi for
medical reasons. In October 2018, authorities
reportedly purposely manipulated readings of
Huang's high blood pressure and rejected
attempts by detention center officials to allow
additional treatment due to ``political''
reasons.
Authorities reportedly required Taiwanese
college employee and non-governmental
organization (NGO) volunteer Lee Ming-cheh to
work more than 10 hours a day without a day of
rest and served him and other prisoners spoiled
food. After Lee's wife Lee Jingyu made public
statements concerning her prison visit,
authorities revoked her right to visit her
husband.
Authorities continued to develop technology-
based means to help public security officials track
persons of interest--based in part on large-scale,
sometimes involuntary collection of personal data--
raising concerns over Chinese citizens' privacy and the
potential for public security officials' capacity to
use this technology to crack down on rights advocates
and other targeted persons. The manner in which
authorities collected personal data, including
biometric data, appeared to violate privacy protections
in international human rights instruments.
While the Chinese government continued to
claim that it reserved the death penalty for a small
number of crimes and only the most serious offenders,
Amnesty International estimated that China carried out
more executions than any other country. China continued
to classify statistics on its use of the death penalty
as a state secret, and the Commission did not observe
official reports on overall death penalty numbers. A
French NGO reported that the death penalty
disproportionately targeted ethnic and religious
minorities, such as Uyghur Muslims, for their religious
beliefs.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Publicly advocate for political prisoners and other
targets of government oppression whom officials have
deprived of liberty on unsubstantiated criminal charges
and for apparent political or religious reasons. Refer
to the Commission's Political Prisoner Database for
details on individual cases.
Include discussion of rights protections for rights
advocates and other targets of government repression in
a wide range of bilateral and multilateral discussions
with Chinese officials. Stress to the Chinese
government the importance of procedural compliance and
effective legal representation in criminal cases in
relation to the goal of rule-based governance.
Urge Chinese officials to end all forms of arbitrary
detention, as well as forms of extrajudicial detention,
that are imposed without meeting the standards for a
fair trial as set forth in the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights and other international
human rights instruments. These include detentions in
``black jails,'' psychiatric institutions, compulsory
drug detoxification centers, and the detention of over
a million Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and other individuals from
ethnic minority groups in mass internment camps in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.
Consult with Chinese officials regarding progress
toward adopting the recommendations made in February
2016 by the UN Committee against Torture in relation to
China's compliance with the Convention against Torture
and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or
Punishment, such as the call to repeal the provisions
in Chinese law allowing for ``residential surveillance
at a designated location.'' Further, encourage Chinese
officials to extend invitations to all UN special
rapporteurs who have requested to visit China.
Urge Chinese officials to adopt a legal and
regulatory framework for technology-based policing
practices that meets international human rights
standards. Such a framework should include, for
example, privacy protections, restrictions on police
authority to collect personal information without
consent, and protections against discriminatory
practices, including profiling of ethnic and religious
minorities. Encourage Chinese officials to require
police who use information technology to complete
appropriate human rights training and impose strict
penalties for officials who authorize or carry out
preemptive detentions.
Stress to the Chinese government the need for greater
transparency on the number and circumstances of
executions and urge Chinese officials to further limit
the crimes for which the death penalty is applicable.
Urge the Chinese government to ban explicitly in
national legislation the harvesting of organs from
executed prisoners.
Continue and, where appropriate, expand support for
programs involving U.S. entities engaging with reform-
minded Chinese organizations and individuals (both
within and outside the government) that draw on
comparative experience to improve the criminal justice
process. For example, the experience of the United
States and other jurisdictions can inform individuals
and institutions in China that are working toward
reducing reliance on confessions, enhancing the role of
witnesses at trials, and creating more reliable
procedures for reviewing death penalty cases.
Call on the Chinese government to publicly commit to
a specific timetable for ratification of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
which the Chinese government signed in 1998 but has not
yet ratified.

Introduction
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year, Chinese
government and Communist Party officials continued to use
criminal law and police power to punish their critics and to
``maintain stability'' (weiwen) with the goal of perpetuating
one-party rule. In doing so, the Chinese government violated
the freedoms and rights of Chinese citizens protected under PRC
laws and international human rights standards \1\ and targeted
rights advocates, religious believers, and ethnic minority
groups in particular.
Use of Criminal Law to Punish Rights Advocates
This past year, authorities continued \2\ to detain
individuals under provisions in the PRC Criminal Law (CL) to
suppress rights advocacy and other activities protected under
international human rights standards.\3\ Selected examples
follow:
CRIMES OF ENDANGERING STATE SECURITY
The Chinese government continued to prosecute individuals
under ``endangering state security'' charges for peacefully
exercising their rights.\4\ CL Articles 102 to 112--listing
offenses including ``subversion of state power,'' \5\
``separatism,'' and ``espionage''--are collectively referred to
as crimes of ``endangering state security,'' \6\ some of which
carry multi-year sentences or the death penalty.\7\
In December 2018, the Zhuhai Municipal
Intermediate People's Court in Guangdong province
sentenced Zhen Jianghua \8\ to two years in prison for
``inciting subversion of state power.'' \9\ Authorities
detained Zhen in September 2017,\10\ and officially
charged him in March 2018.\11\ Zhen is the executive
director of Human Rights Campaign in China (HRCIC),
which reports on cases involving rights advocacy and
provides aid for people who are involved in or who have
reported on advocacy cases.\12\
Beginning on December 9, 2018, public security
officials in Chengdu municipality, Sichuan province,
took into custody over 100 leaders and members of the
Early Rain Covenant Church, an unregistered Protestant
house church in Chengdu municipality, Sichuan
province.\13\ Authorities criminally detained Early
Rain founder and pastor Wang Yi \14\ and placed Wang's
wife Jiang Rong \15\ under ``residential surveillance
at a designated location,'' both on suspicion of
``inciting subversion of state power.'' \16\ [For more
information on the crackdown on Early Rain, see Section
II--Freedom of Religion.]
Additional cases in which authorities detained
rights advocates on ``subversion'' grounds include
human rights lawyer Wang Quanzhang,\17\ Civil Rights
and Livelihood Watch founder Liu Feiyue,\18\ and
Tiananmen Square protest leader Zhou Yongjun.\19\
PICKING QUARRELS AND PROVOKING TROUBLE
Authorities used the charge of ``picking quarrels and
provoking trouble'' \20\ under Article 293 of the PRC Criminal
Law to punish petitioners and rights advocates.\21\ One Chinese
legal scholar described the criminal charge as being ``so
broadly defined and ambiguously worded that prosecutors can
apply it to almost any activity they deem undesirable, even if
it may not otherwise meet the standards of criminality.'' \22\
In April 2019, the Chengdu Municipal
Intermediate People's Court in Chengdu, Sichuan
province, tried Zhang Junyong,\23\ Fu Hailu,\24\ and
Luo Fuyu \25\ and sentenced them to three years in
prison, suspended for four to five years,\26\ and Chen
Bing \27\ to three years and six months in prison, all
for ``picking quarrels and provoking trouble.'' \28\
Authorities first detained the four in May 2016 on
suspicion of ``inciting subversion of state power''
after Fu posted images online of satirical liquor
bottles meant to commemorate the violent suppression of
the June 4, 1989 Tiananmen pro-democracy protests.\29\
In May 2019, the Gulou District People's Court
in Xuzhou municipality, Jiangsu province, sentenced
Zhang Kun \30\ to two years and six months in prison
for ``picking quarrels and provoking trouble.'' \31\
The arrest and sentencing was connected to Zhang
posting a video in which he revealed that prison
authorities at Pengcheng Prison in Yunlong district,
Xuzhou, had subjected him to torture and abuse while he
was imprisoned there between 2015 and 2016 for the same
charge.\32\
ORGANIZING AND USING A CULT TO UNDERMINE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE LAW
Authorities continued to charge members of religious
communities and spiritual movements with ``organizing and using
a cult organization to undermine implementation of the law''
under CL Article 300.\33\ For example, in January 2019,
Qingshan District People's Court in Baotou municipality, Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region, sentenced Falun Gong practitioners
Wang Ying \34\ and Wang Hongling \35\ to two years in prison
and one year and six months in prison, respectively.\36\
Authorities detained the two in connection to Falun Gong
materials they distributed in Batou.\37\ [For more information
on official Chinese persecution of Falun Gong, see Section II--
Freedom of Religion.]
OTHER CRIMINAL LAW PROVISIONS
Authorities accused rights advocates and others of other
criminal offenses, including ``gathering a crowd to disturb
social order,'' \38\ ``obstructing official business,'' \39\
and ``illegal business activity'' \40\ on account of activities
protected under international human rights standards.\41\
Arbitrary Detention
Authorities continued to use various forms of arbitrary
detention \42\ that deprive individuals of their liberty,
contravening international human rights standards.\43\ During
China's November 2018 UN Human Rights Council Universal
Periodic Review (UPR) of the Chinese government's human rights
record, non-governmental organizations and member states called
for the Chinese government to end its use of arbitrary
detention, including in mass internment camps used to
arbitrarily detain Uyghur Muslims and other ethnic minority
groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region.\44\ [For more
information on arbitrary detention in China's mass internment
camps, see Section IV--Xinjiang.] During the UPR, China
rejected calls to end various forms of arbitrary detention.\45\
Descriptions of selected forms of arbitrary detention
follow:
BLACK JAILS
Authorities continued to hold individuals in ``black
jails,'' extralegal detention sites that operate outside of the
PRC's judicial and administrative detention systems.\46\ For
example, authorities or individuals presumably acting on their
behalf held rights advocates in ``black jails'' as a part of
``stability maintenance'' efforts leading up to the Shanghai
International Import Expo in November 2018,\47\ and the annual
meetings of the National People's Congress and Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference in March 2019.\48\
PSYCHIATRIC FACILITIES
Authorities continued to forcibly commit individuals
without mental illness to psychiatric facilities--a practice
known as ``bei jingshenbing''--to punish rights advocates,
despite protections in the PRC Mental Health Law (MHL) \49\ and
related regulations.\50\ [For more information, see Section
II--Public Health.] For example, from August to October 2018,
authorities forcibly committed Lu Qianrong \51\ to a
psychiatric facility in Changzhou municipality, Jiangsu
province, reportedly due to Lu's posting ``unfavorably against
the country'' on social media.\52\ Authorities reportedly
forced Lu to take daily antipsychotic medication while in
detention.\53\
ADMINISTRATIVE DETENTION
Authorities continued to use administrative forms of
detention, which allow officials to detain individuals without
judicial oversight or protections for their rights under the
PRC Criminal Procedure Law (CPL). For example, police have
ordered human rights defenders to serve up to 20 days of
administrative detention without any judicial process.\54\ In
addition, authorities continued to operate compulsory drug
detoxification centers \55\ where they can hold detainees for
up to two years.\56\
This past year, Chinese authorities, human rights
advocates, and legal scholars continued to call for the
abolition of ``custody and education'' (shourong jiaoyu),\57\
in which public security officials can detain sex workers and
their clients for six months to two years without judicial
oversight.\58\ Chinese legal experts have questioned the
legality of such ``extrajudicial prisons without any due
process.'' \59\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Chinese Authorities' Retaliatory Use of Criminal Law against Canadian
Citizens
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
On December 10, 2018, Chinese authorities separately detained Canadian
citizens Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig on suspicion of
``endangering state security.'' \60\ Reports suggest that authorities
held Spavor and Kovrig under ``residential surveillance at a designated
location'' (RSDL),\61\ a coercive measure under the CPL that allows
security authorities to hold a criminal suspect in de facto
incommunicado detention for up to six months.\62\ Reports further
indicate that authorities held them in conditions that some experts
have said may amount to torture.\63\ In May 2019, the Chinese Ministry
of Foreign Affairs said that authorities had formally arrested both
Spavor and Kovrig for crimes of ``endangering state security.'' \64\
In another case involving a Canadian citizen, the Dalian Municipal
Intermediate People's Court in Liaoning province changed Robert
Schellenberg's sentence for drug smuggling from a 15-year imprisonment
to a death sentence in January 2019,\65\ in spite of a provision in the
PRC Criminal Procedure Law generally prohibiting the trial court from
imposing a harsher sentence in a retrial.\66\ The court cited ``new
evidence'' for the change in Schellenberg's original November 2018
judgment of 15 years.\67\ Moreover, Chinese lawyers and international
observers noted irregularities in Schellenberg's case, namely, the
court of second instance having remanded the case without being
requested to do so by the procuratorate, as well as the expediency with
which the court of first instance concluded the case on remand (16
days), compared to the first round of proceedings (two years).\68\
Observers suggested that the detentions of Spavor and Kovrig as well
as the death sentence of Schellenberg, were likely Chinese authorities'
attempt to exert pressure on the Canadian government \69\ for the
arrest of the chief financial officer of the Chinese technology company
Huawei,\70\ Meng Wanzhou,\71\ whom Canadian authorities detained based
on an extradition request made by the U.S. Department of Justice.\72\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
``RETENTION IN CUSTODY'' (LIUZHI) UNDER THE PRC SUPERVISION LAW
The PRC Supervision Law (Supervision Law),\73\ authorizes
the National Supervisory Commission (NSC) to investigate
suspected official misconduct \74\ using methods including
``retention in custody'' (liuzhi),\75\ an extrajudicial form of
detention that allows NSC officials to hold individuals without
legal representation.\76\ ``Retention in custody'' contravenes
rights guaranteed by international legal standards, as it
denies the ``minimum guarantees'' of those charged as a
criminal including access to counsel, and to be tried while
present.\77\
In early October 2018, authorities placed then President of
the International Criminal Police Organization (Interpol), Meng
Hongwei, under liuzhi while he was on a trip to China.\78\ NSC
officials transferred Meng's case to the Supreme People's
Procuratorate, which approved his arrest on April 23, 2019.\79\
In June 2019, while on trial in the Tianjin No. 1 Intermediate
People's Court, Meng pled guilty to taking bribes.\80\ One
Chinese commentator noted that the NSC's detention of the
president of an organization such as Interpol highlights a
``new normal'' of Chinese authorities arresting Party officials
in anti-corruption cases despite their positions in prominent
international organizations.\81\
Ongoing Challenges in the Implementation of the Criminal Procedure Law
This past year, the National People's Congress Standing
Committee passed legislation that could adversely affect the
rights of prisoners and detainees. In addition, the Commission
continued to observe reports of authorities violating the
rights of detainees, despite protections in the PRC Criminal
Procedure Law (CPL) \82\ and international human rights
standards.\83\
LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS
In October 2018, the National People's Congress Standing
Committee passed an amendment to the CPL.\84\ In cases of
corruption, state security, and terrorism,\85\ the amendment
allows courts to try defendants in absentia, which violates
international fair trial standards.\86\ Rights groups warned
that Chinese authorities might use this amendment to threaten
and punish human rights defenders outside of China through
abuse of international arrest warrants.\87\
The CPL amendment also provides for lenient and expedited
sentencing, both of which require the defendant to
``voluntarily'' confess his or her crime, despite ongoing
concerns about the reliance on coerced confessions in China's
criminal justice system.\88\ ``Lenient sentencing'' is allowed
if the defendant admits to a crime, does not dispute the facts
of the case, and willingly accepts punishment.\89\
Additionally, the amendment provides for expedited sentencing
in cases under the jurisdiction of basic-level people's courts
of a defendant who faces a maximum three-year sentence, has
confessed, accepted punishment, and who agrees to the use of an
expedited process.\90\
COERCED CONFESSIONS
Authorities continued to coerce detainees to confess guilt
to crimes, in violation of the CPL,\91\ and in some cases
forced detainees to recite apparently scripted remarks in court
or on camera while in pretrial custody.\92\
For example, in or around January 2019, authorities
reportedly forced more than 20 university students involved in
labor advocacy to watch video confessions of four young labor
rights advocates--Yue Xin,\93\ Shen Mengyu,\94\ Gu Jiayue,\95\
and Zheng Yongming \96\--whom authorities detained in August
2018 after they had helped organize protests in support of
workers' attempts to organize a union at Jasic Technology in
Shenzhen municipality, Guangdong province.\97\ The students
reported that the videos appeared coerced,\98\ and that
authorities showed the video confessions in order to deter
students from further activism.\99\ [For more information on
the Jasic student protests advocating labor rights, see Section
II--Worker Rights. For information on the televised confession
of former Supreme People's Court Judge Wang Linqing, see
Section III--Access to Justice.]
PROLONGED PRETRIAL DETENTION
Authorities in some cases held suspects in pretrial
detention beyond limits allowed in the CPL \100\ and
international human rights standards.\101\ Observers indicate
that detainees held in prolonged pretrial detention are at an
increased risk of torture.\102\
For example, in February 2017, authorities in
Beijing municipality detained Falun Gong practitioner
Sun Qian for ``organizing and using a cult to undermine
implementation of the law.'' \103\ During her trial in
September 2018, Sun said that she was tortured while in
custody,\104\ and lawyers have noted that in addition
to arbitrary and prolonged pretrial detention,
authorities have prevented her from obtaining legal
counsel by harassing and intimidating 11 different
lawyers she had hired to represent her.\105\
This past year, Chinese courts tried and
sentenced individuals after prolonged periods of
pretrial detention, including human rights lawyer Wang
Quanzhang \106\ (pretrial detention of almost three
years and six months),\107\ four men in the ``June
Fourth liquor'' case (almost three years of pretrial
detention for each),\108\ and founder of rights website
64 Tianwang Huang Qi \109\ (held for two years and
eight months before receiving a sentence).\110\
ACCESS TO COUNSEL
Authorities continued to deny some criminal suspects
meetings with their lawyers and to prevent others from hiring
their preferred attorneys, particularly in cases involving
rights advocates. Chinese law grants suspects and defendants
the right to hire \111\ and meet with defense counsel,\112\ but
it restricts meetings in cases of ``endangering state
security,'' such as terrorism, or significant bribes,\113\ as
well as for those held in ``residential surveillance at a
designated location'' (RSDL),\114\ contravening international
standards.\115\
For example, in January 2019, the Tianjin No. 2
Intermediate People's Court sentenced human rights lawyer Wang
Quanzhang to four years and six months in prison for ``inciting
subversion of state power,'' a crime of ``endangering state
security.'' \116\ Authorities prevented lawyers appointed by
Wang's wife, Li Wenzu, from representing Wang in court,\117\
and Wang dismissed his state-
appointed lawyer during the trial.\118\ Wang is well known for
taking on cases of Falun Gong practitioners, petitioners, and
others deemed ``politically sensitive'' by authorities, and had
been in custody since the July 2015 crackdown on human rights
lawyers.\119\ Several international observers expressed concern
over Wang's deprivation of counsel and continued
detention.\120\ [For more information on access to counsel and
the harassment and prosecution of rights lawyers, see Section
III--Access to Justice.]
RESIDENTIAL SURVEILLANCE AT A DESIGNATED LOCATION
Authorities continued to place some criminal suspects in
``residential surveillance at a designated location''
(RSDL),\121\ a form of incommunicado detention that can last up
to six months,\122\ restricts access to counsel,\123\ and
places detainees at risk of abuse by authorities.\124\
For example, in January 2019, authorities detained former
Chinese official and Australian citizen Yang Hengjun \125\ when
he arrived in China from New York.\126\ Authorities placed Yang
in RSDL on suspicion of ``endangering national security.''
\127\ Authorities did not inform the Australian embassy within
three days of Yang's detention in violation of the China-
Australian consular agreement.\128\ In August 2019, Chinese
authorities notified Australian diplomats that Yang had been
formally arrested on suspicion of committing espionage.\129\
Yang has written articles critical of the Chinese
government.\130\
Torture and Abuse in Custody
Authorities continued to torture and abuse detainees,\131\
violating international standards.\132\ Examples include the
following:
On February 28, 2019, rights lawyer Jiang
Tianyong completed his two-year prison term for
``inciting subversion of state power.'' \133\ Upon his
release, Jiang told his wife that authorities had
deprived him of sunlight and ordered him to sit on a
marble block for prolonged periods, injuring his spine
and causing him to no longer be able to sit up
straight.\134\ Jiang's wife also said that Jiang
suffered from depression and significant memory
loss.\135\
In December 2018, Lee Jingyu, wife of
Taiwanese college employee and non-governmental
organization (NGO) volunteer Lee Ming-cheh,\136\
reported that authorities in Chishan Prison in Nanzui
township, Yuanjiang city, Yiyang municipality, Hunan
province, required her husband to work more than 10
hours a day without a day of rest, and served him and
other prisoners rotten food.\137\ Under such treatment,
Lee has reportedly lost significant weight.\138\ After
she made public statements concerning her prison visit,
authorities revoked Lee Jingyu's right to visit her
husband for three months.\139\ In 2017, authorities
sentenced Lee Ming-cheh to five years' imprisonment for
``subversion of state power.'' \140\
Medical Care in Custody
Authorities continued to deny or fail to provide adequate
medical care to some detainees, which violates international
human rights standards \141\ and may amount to torture.\142\
Human rights website 64 Tianwang founder Huang
Qi, whom authorities detained in 2016,\143\ suffers
from ``high blood pressure, heart disease, [a] chronic
kidney condition, and hydrocephalus.'' \144\ The
Mianyang Municipality Public Security Bureau (PSB) in
Sichuan province has denied requests to release Huang
on ``bail on medical grounds.'' \145\ In October 2018,
Huang reportedly told his lawyer that authorities in
Sichuan manipulated readings of his high blood pressure
and the Mianyang PSB rejected attempts by detention
center officials to allow additional treatment due to
``political'' reasons.\146\ In January 2019, the
Mianyang Municipal Intermediate People's Court tried
Huang on charges of ``illegally providing state secrets
to foreign entities'' and ``intentionally leaking state
secrets.'' \147\ During the trial, Huang dismissed his
lawyer out of concern for his lawyer's safety.\148\ In
July 2019, the court sentenced Huang to 12 years in
prison.\149\
In July 2019, legal advocate Ji Sizun \150\
died in a hospital less than three months after
completing a term of four years and six months in
prison, which authorities reportedly imposed in
connection to his support of the 2014 Hong Kong pro-
democracy protests (``Umbrella Movement'').\151\
Despite having completed his sentence in April, Ji
remained in the custody of authorities in Fujian
province, who placed him in a local hospital and
restricted family visits.\152\ Ji suffered a paralyzing
stroke in prison, intestinal cancer, and other
illnesses, but authorities reportedly denied him
adequate medical treatment and denied applications for
medical parole.\153\ Ji died after his condition
worsened due to internal bleeding.\154\ Within hours of
Ji's death, police officers reportedly coerced Ji's
family to consent to immediate cremation.\155\
Wrongful Conviction
Although authorities highlighted efforts to correct past
wrongful convictions and to prevent future ones,\156\ some
Chinese legal experts expressed concern about continued abusive
practices that facilitated wrongful convictions, such as
illegal collection of evidence and coerced confessions.\157\
The Dui Hua Foundation noted how authorities' use of unreliable
jailhouse informants could lead to wrongful convictions.\158\
The Commission observed reports of wrongful convictions
overturned this year:
In November 2018, the Jilin Province High
People's Court found Jin Zhehong--who had already
served 23 years in prison--not guilty because ``the
evidence was insufficient and the facts were not
clear'' in the murder of a 20-year old woman.\159\ One
of Jin's lawyers said his client had ``repeatedly
accused the investigators of using torture to extract
confessions out of him.'' \160\
In January 2019, the Liaoyuan Municipal
Intermediate People's Court in Jilin province ordered
4.6 million-yuan (approximately US$670,000)
compensation for Liu Zhonglin after he served 25 years
in prison.\161\ During his 1994 trial for murder, Liu
did not have a lawyer present, and has maintained that
police tortured him to obtain a confession.\162\
Policing
This past year, authorities continued to develop
technology-based means to help public security officials track
persons of interest.\163\ These developments are based in part
on large-scale, sometimes involuntary collection of personal
data--raising concerns about privacy and public security
officials' capacity to crack down on rights advocates and other
targeted persons.\164\ Collection of personal information,
including biometric data, may violate privacy protections in
international human rights instruments,\165\ and the Commission
did not observe efforts by authorities to bring the collection
or use of such information in line with international
standards.\166\ Examples of technology used to track and
collect data on individuals included \167\ smart glasses,\168\
artificial intelligence,\169\ facial recognition,\170\ and
drones.\171\ Authorities increasingly used technology that can
scan facial features as well as vehicle license plates \172\
for comparison against a centralized database linked with other
personal information.\173\ At times the technology was used in
conjunction with the social credit system.\174\ [For more
information on the social credit system, see Section II--
Business and Human Rights.] Reports indicated that authorities
use such technology to publicly shame individual
lawbreakers.\175\ While such technology could aid criminal
investigations, observers have noted the risk involved in
authorities using the technology against human rights
advocates.\176\ Reports indicated that U.S. and Chinese firms
aided Chinese police in developing their surveillance
technology.\177\ [For more information on the involvement of
U.S. companies in the Chinese government's development and
procurement of surveillance technology, see Section II--
Business and Human Rights. For information on public security
and counterterrorism policy implementation in the Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region, see Section IV--Xinjiang.]
In addition, in February 2019, new provisions from the
Ministry of Public Security took effect \178\ with the stated
purpose of ``protecting the law enforcement authority of the
police.'' \179\ The provisions address concerns for police
officers' safety when their interaction with citizens becomes
violent by permitting the Ministry of Public Security to punish
``actors who violate the law enforcement authority of the
police,'' \180\ as well as reducing the liability of individual
police for damage caused in the line of duty.\181\ A Chinese
legal expert asserted that under the new regulations, the
increase in police authority comes at the expense of citizens'
rights.\182\
Death Penalty
Following the November 2018 session of the UN Human Rights
Council's Universal Periodic Review of the Chinese government's
human rights record, the Chinese government rejected all
recommendations calling for reform of its use of the death
penalty,\183\ and continued \184\ to claim that it reserved the
death penalty for a small number of crimes and only the most
serious offenders.\185\ Amnesty International, however,
estimated that authorities ``execute[d] and sentence[d] to
death thousands of people,'' more than any other country,\186\
and officials voiced support for the continued use of the death
penalty.\187\ The Chinese government classifies statistics on
its use of the death penalty as a ``state secret,'' \188\ and
the Commission did not observe official reports on overall
death penalty numbers.
According to a French NGO, authorities disproportionately
sentenced religious minorities, including Uyghurs of the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, to the death penalty for
their religious beliefs.\189\ For example, in a case reported
by Radio Free Asia in November 2018, authorities sentenced to
death prominent Uyghur businessman and philanthropist,
Abdughappar Abdurusul, reportedly for taking a trip to Saudi
Arabia for the Hajj pilgrimage.\190\ [For more information on
the crackdown on Uyghurs in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous
Region, see Section IV--Xinjiang.]
Organ Harvesting
Between July and August 2019, two scientific journals
retracted at least 13 transplant studies by authors in China
published between 2008 and 2014.\191\ The studies were
retracted after a bioethicist and her colleagues raised
concerns that organs in certain studies may have been sourced
from executed prisoners in China.\192\

Findings
Observers have described religious persecution
in China over the last year to be of an intensity not
seen since the Cultural Revolution. The Chinese
government under President and Communist Party General
Secretary Xi Jinping has doubled down on the
``sinicization'' of religion--a campaign that aims to
bring religion in China under closer official control
and in line with officially sanctioned interpretations
of Chinese culture. Authorities have expanded the
``sinicization'' campaign to target not only religions
perceived as ``foreign,'' such as Islam and
Christianity, but also Chinese Buddhism, Taoism, and
folk religious beliefs.
Party disciplinary regulations were revised to
impose harsher punishments on Party members for
manifestations of religious belief.
In sharp contrast to their past treatment of
Buddhist and Taoist communities, local officials
directly targeted local Buddhist and Taoist sites of
worship throughout China. Local officials in the
provinces of Liaoning, Shanxi, Hubei, and Hebei ordered
the destruction of Buddhist statues. In past decades,
government and Party officials had rarely targeted
Chinese Buddhist and Taoist communities with direct
suppression--both were considered to be relatively
compliant with Party and government leadership and
compatible with the official promotion of traditional
Chinese culture.
In September 2018, the Chinese Ministry of
Foreign Affairs signed an agreement with the Holy See,
paving the way for the unification of state-sanctioned
and underground Catholic communities. Subsequently,
local Chinese authorities subjected Catholic believers
in China to increased persecution by demolishing
churches, removing crosses, and continuing to detain
underground clergy. The Party-led Catholic national
religious organizations also published a plan to
``sinicize'' Catholicism in China.
As in previous years, authorities continued to
detain Falun Gong practitioners and subject them to
harsh treatment, with at least 931 practitioners
sentenced for criminal ``cult'' offenses in 2018. Human
rights organizations and Falun Gong practitioners
documented coercive and violent practices against
practitioners in custody, including physical violence,
forced drug administration, sleep deprivation, and
other forms of torture.
Violations of the religious freedom of Hui
Muslim believers continued to intensify, with plans to
apply ``anti-terrorism'' measures currently used in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region (Ningxia)--a region with a high
concentration of Hui Muslim believers. A five-year plan
to ``sinicize'' Islam in China was passed in January
2019. Meanwhile, ongoing policies included measures
requiring Islamic religious leaders and lay believers
to demonstrate their political reliability.
Religious communities outside of the five
religions that are the main objects of official
regulation continued to exist in China, but the
religious practices of communities that previously
received tacit recognition and support were subject to
repression over the last year.

are encouraged to:
Call on the Chinese government to guarantee to all
citizens freedom of religion in accordance with its
international human rights obligations. Stress to
Chinese authorities that freedom of religion includes
the right to freely adopt beliefs and practice
religious activities without government interference.
Stress to the Chinese government that the right to
freedom of religion includes, but is not limited to:
the right of Buddhists and Taoists to carry out
activities in temples and to select monastic teachers
independent of state control; the right of Catholics to
be led by clergy who are selected and who conduct their
ministry according to the standard called for by
Catholic religious beliefs; the right of Falun Gong
practitioners to freely practice Falun Gong inside
China; the right of Muslims to freely preach, undertake
overseas pilgrimage, select and train religious
leaders, and wear clothing with religious significance;
the right of Protestants to exercise their faith free
from state controls over doctrine and worship, and free
from harassment, detention, and other abuses for public
and private manifestations of their faith, including
the display of crosses; and the right of members of
other religious communities to be free from state
control and harassment.
Call for the release of Chinese citizens confined,
detained, or imprisoned for peacefully pursuing their
religious beliefs, as well as people confined,
detained, or imprisoned in connection to their
association with those people. The Administration
should use existing laws to hold accountable Chinese
government officials and others complicit in severe
religious freedom restrictions, including by using the
sanctions available in the Global Magnitsky Human
Rights Accountability Act (Public Law No. 114-328) and
the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (Public
Law No. 105-292). Ensure that conditions related to
religious freedom are taken into account when
negotiating any trade agreement as mandated by the
Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and
Accountability Act of 2015 (Public Law No. 114-26).
Call on the Chinese government to fully implement
accepted recommendations from its October 2013 session
of the UN Human Rights Council's Universal Periodic
Review, including taking necessary measures to ensure
that rights to freedom of religion, religious culture,
and expression are fully observed and protected;
cooperating with the UN human rights system,
specifically UN special procedures and mandate holders;
facilitating visits to China for UN High Commissioners;
taking steps to ensure that lawyers working to advance
religious rights can practice their profession freely,
and promptly investigating allegations of violence and
intimidation impeding their work; and considering
possible revisions to legislation and administrative
rules to provide better protection of freedom of
religion.
Call on the Chinese government to abolish Article 300
of the PRC Criminal Law, which criminalizes
``organizing and using a cult to undermine
implementation of the law,'' and Article 27 of the PRC
Public Security Administration Punishment Law, which
provides for detention or fines for organizing or
inciting others to engage in ``cult'' activities and
for using ``cults'' or the ``guise of religion'' to
disturb social order or to harm others' health.
Encourage U.S. political leaders to visit religious
sites in China to raise awareness of and promote
freedom of religion.

International and Chinese Law on Religious Freedom
Both Chinese and international law provide guarantees of
religious freedom. Despite these guarantees, the Commission
continued to observe widespread and systematic violation of the
principles of religious freedom, as Chinese authorities
exercised broad discretion over religious practice.
Under international law, freedom of religion or belief
encompasses both the right to form, hold, and change
convictions, beliefs, and religion--which cannot be
restricted--and the right to outwardly manifest those beliefs--
which can be limited for certain, specific justifications.\1\
These principles are codified in various international
instruments, including the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR).\2\ China has signed \3\ and stated its intent
to ratify \4\ the ICCPR, which obligates China to refrain in
good faith from acts that would defeat the treaty's purpose.\5\
Article 36 of China's Constitution guarantees citizens
``freedom of religious belief'' and protection for ``normal
religious activities.'' \6\ With essential terms such as
``normal'' undefined, it is unclear whether China's
Constitution protects the same range of belief and outward
manifestation that is recognized under international law.\7\
Nevertheless, China's Constitution and other legal provisions
\8\ join the ICCPR in prohibiting discrimination based on
religion \9\ and loosely parallel the ICCPR's prohibition on
coercion \10\ by forbidding state agencies, social
organizations, and individuals from compelling citizens to
believe or not believe in any religion.\11\
China's Constitution prohibits ``making use of religion to
engage in activities that disrupt social order, impair the
health of citizens, or interfere with the educational system of
the State.'' \12\ The ICCPR does allow State Parties to
restrict outward manifestations of religion or belief, but such
restrictions must be ``prescribed by law and . . . necessary to
protect public safety, order, health, or morals or the
fundamental rights and freedoms of others.'' \13\
Policies and Regulations Pertaining to Religious Freedom
Top Chinese officials continued to emphasize
the importance of the national-level campaign to
``sinicize'' religion. Members of the Standing
Committee of the Communist Party Central Committee
Political Bureau (Politburo)--China's top policymaking
body--continued to highlight the need to ``sinicize''
religion in China at national-level political
gatherings.\14\ Politburo Standing Committee member
Wang Yang promoted the campaign among lower level
officials through local visits \15\ and in meetings
with state-affiliated religious organizations.\16\
Party General Secretary Xi Jinping announced ``the need
to uphold the sinicization of religion in order to
actively guide religions to adapt to socialist
society'' in 2015,\17\ and the subsequent
``sinicization'' campaign aims to bring religion in
China under closer official control and in line with
officially sanctioned interpretations of Chinese
culture.\18\ In the years following, officials have
escalated the repression of religious practice, which
one scholar of Chinese politics has characterized as
being the worst since the Cultural Revolution.\19\
The ``sinicization'' campaign characterizes
control over religious groups as connected to national
security and foreign affairs. The repression of
religion is happening alongside a general crackdown on
popular culture \20\ as the Party responds to the
increased complexity of society and the growth of new
groups in the period of economic reform and
opening.\21\ Religious believers are among the social
groups of which Chinese officials are the most
wary.\22\ This is in part because the fast growth and
the level of organization within certain religious
communities represents the potential for competing with
the Party and government monopoly on collective
organization.\23\ Party and government officials accuse
some of these religious communities of being used by
foreign forces to ``infiltrate'' Chinese society,\24\
targeting Christian, Muslim, and Tibetan Buddhist
groups in particular as retaining undue foreign
influence.\25\ Official pronouncements also identified
``extremism'' as a particular problem that officials
should address within Islam.\26\ Meanwhile, Party and
government policy promoted the Chinese Buddhist
community to project an image of China as a country
supporting Buddhism while fostering connections with
majority-Buddhist countries.\27\
Administration of religious affairs and
implementation of the revised Regulations on Religious
Affairs. Local government bureaus continued to be
responsible for managing religious affairs.\28\ These
religious affairs agencies have effective authority
over the state-sanctioned ``patriotic'' religious
associations that act as liaisons between the
government and practitioners of the five ``main''
religions in China,\29\ while the Party's United Front
Work Department vets the association leaders.\30\
Public security bureaus are generally responsible for
enforcement of laws against religious activity that
authorities deem illegal.\31\ Following President and
Party General Secretary Xi Jinping's exhortations to
focus on religious work,\32\ the regulatory framework
for religion imposed increased restrictions on
religious freedom through revisions to the Regulations
on Religious Affairs that took effect on February 1,
2018.\33\ The revisions include prohibitions on groups,
schools, and venues engaging in or hosting religious
activities unless they have been officially designated
as religious (Article 41) and on clergy acting as
religious professionals without official certification
(Article 36).\34\ The revisions also established legal
responsibilities and penalties for violations of the
regulations, including fining those who ``provide the
conditions'' for unauthorized religious activities
(Article 71).\35\
Other laws and Party policies also continued
to restrict citizens' freedom to hold religious beliefs
and practice religion. Article 300 of the PRC Criminal
Law criminalizes ``organizing and using a cult to
undermine implementation of the law,'' \36\ and the PRC
National Security Law prohibits ``the use of religion
to conduct illegal criminal activities that threaten
state security.'' \37\ The latter also contains
mandates to ``maintain the order of normal religious
activities,'' ``oppose the interference of foreign
influence into domestic religious affairs,'' and
``suppress cult organizations.'' \38\
Revised Party disciplinary regulations impose
harsher punishments on Party members for manifestations
of religious belief. New disciplinary measures for
Party members that increased the penalty for
involvement in religious activities in violation of
Party policies from a warning for a ``minor offense''
to dismissal took effect on October 1, 2018.\39\ One
international law expert has noted that because Party
membership to a large degree determines the extent to
which citizens may participate in public life, the ban
on religious belief for Party members constitutes
discrimination against religious believers and a
violation of freedom of religious belief.\40\
Buddhism (Non-Tibetan) and Taoism
In sharp contrast to the past treatment of Buddhist and
Taoist communities, the Commission observed numerous reports of
local officials ordering the destruction of Buddhist statues
throughout China, including in the provinces of Liaoning,
Shanxi, Hubei, and Hebei.\41\ Officials in Dalian municipality,
Liaoning province, ordered Buddhist iconography taken down and
replaced with the Chinese national flag.\42\ In September 2018,
the Party secretary of Hebei province threatened county-level
officials with dismissal if a large bronze Guanyin bodhisattva
statue in their jurisdiction was not demolished.\43\ In
November 2017 the State Administration for Religious Affairs
and 11 other central Party and government departments issued a
joint opinion targeted at combating commercialization in
Buddhism and Taoism that prohibited the construction of large
outdoor statues so as to avoid negative effects on ``the
healthy development of [the two religions'] dissemination.''
\44\ One human rights expert has noted that when a state
distinguishes between proper and improper conduct in order to
uphold religious standards or to enhance the legitimacy of
particular religions over others, it violates the state
neutrality necessary to maintain the free exercise of religious
freedom.\45\
A large number of Chinese citizens engage in Buddhist and
Taoist practices, with estimates of around 244 million
Buddhists as of 2010,\46\ and 173 million citizens engaging in
some Taoist practices as of 2007.\47\ [For information on
Tibetan Buddhism, see Section V--Tibet.] Both communities have
been subjected to extensive regulation and control by
officials: government authorities connected with local
religious affairs bureaus are involved with the administration
of officially sanctioned temples; all candidates for the clergy
must obtain the approval of the local patriotic association and
religious affairs bureau for ordination; \48\ and Buddhist
ordinations themselves are restricted by the state-run
patriotic associations.\49\
In past decades, government and Party officials rarely
targeted Chinese Buddhist and Taoist communities with direct
suppression--both were considered to be relatively compliant
with Party and government leadership and compatible with the
official promotion of traditional Chinese culture.\50\ At the
outset of the implementation of ``sinicization'' policies in
Buddhist and Taoist contexts, Chinese officials had sought to
bolster the idea of these two religions as indigenous religions
embodying Chinese culture and values so that they might serve
as a bulwark against ``infiltration'' of other values via
religions perceived as foreign.\51\ Officials also sought to
leverage the Buddhist and Taoist communities to foster closer
diplomatic ties with other countries with significant Buddhist
or Taoist communities--an aim that has persisted within this
reporting year to include overtures toward majority-Buddhist
countries.\52\
Christianity--Catholicism
The number of Catholics in China is estimated to be around
10.5 million,\53\ and they have historically been divided
between ``official'' congregations led by state-sanctioned
bishops and ``underground'' congregations whose bishops are not
recognized by the Chinese government.\54\ Official statistics
reported in 2018 that 6 million Catholics were part of
officially sanctioned congregations \55\ with bishops selected
by Party-led religious organizations and ordained by other
official bishops--a process described by the Chinese government
as ``self-selection and self-ordination.'' \56\ Underground
Catholic believers have historically avoided the ministry of
official bishops because of the belief that legitimate
ecclesiastical authority can be conferred only by the Pope's
mandate,\57\ and also an objection to official bishops'
affiliation with the Party-led body for Catholic leadership in
China, the Catholic Patriotic Association (CPA).\58\
Underground clergy are frequently subjected to detention and
other government pressure to compel them to join the CPA.\59\
The Holy See and the Chinese government announced a
provisional agreement on the appointment of bishops on
September 22, 2018.\60\ A representative for the Holy See
stated that its aim was for Chinese Catholic believers to have
bishops recognized by both the Holy See and Chinese
authorities,\61\ while observers noted that the Chinese
government was likely seeking to increase its control over the
underground community.\62\ Although the terms of the agreement
were not made public, a source familiar with the negotiations
stated that the agreement gave the Chinese government the
authority to nominate bishops, which the Pope would retain the
right to veto.\63\ The Holy See also recognized seven formerly
excommunicated official bishops as part of the deal,\64\ having
already asked two underground bishops to give up their
positions to make way for two of these state-sanctioned
bishops; \65\ the Chinese government made no commitments toward
recognizing the more than 30 underground bishops.\66\
Observers and Catholic believers expressed concern that the
agreement did not provide sufficient support for the Chinese
Catholic community,\67\ with one scholar pointing out that the
authorities' persecution of both underground and official
Catholic communities has actually intensified over the last
year under the ``sinicization'' campaign.\68\ In spring 2019,
authorities detained three underground priests of Xuanhua
diocese in Hebei province.\69\
Christianity--Protestantism
During the 2019 reporting year, Chinese officials further
\70\ escalated the repression of Protestant Christian belief.
While official repression has historically focused on
unregistered church communities (commonly referred to as
``house churches''), believers worshiping at state-sanctioned
churches have also become targets of state restrictions under
President Xi Jinping.\71\ The number of Chinese Protestants is
estimated to number around 60 to 80 million.\72\ Instances of
official persecution recorded by U.S.-based organization
advocating for religious freedom, ChinaAid Association
(ChinaAid), increased from 1,265 in 2017 to more than 10,000 in
2018.\73\
Much of the increased repression targeted house church
communities. Several major house churches with hundreds to
thousands of members were forcibly closed: Zion Church and
Shouwang Church, among the largest unregistered churches in
Beijing municipality, were banned in September 2018 and March
2019, respectively; \74\ Rongguili Church, an important church
in southern China, Guangzhou municipality, Guangdong province,
was forced to suspend activities in December 2018; \75\ and
Early Rain Covenant Church (Early Rain) in Chengdu
municipality, Sichuan province, was declared an ``illegal
social organization'' in December 2018.\76\ Beginning December
9, authorities also detained more than 100 Early Rain church
members for several days, including Early Rain pastor Wang
Qi,\77\ who, along with three other church members, remained in
criminal detention as of August 2019.\78\
Local authorities also banned or shut down activities at
numerous other house churches across China,\79\ with a campaign
in Henan province reportedly aiming to close more than two-
thirds of all churches within the province.\80\ Local
authorities in different areas also pressured unregistered
churches to disband with repeated raids and harassment,\81\
heavy administrative penalties,\82\ termination of electricity
and water supplies,\83\ and compelling landlords to evict
churches from meeting spaces.\84\ Authorities also subjected
individual members of house church communities to detention:
ChinaAid recorded more than 5,000 detentions in 2018, more than
1,000 of which were of church leaders.\85\ Members were also
subject to other rights abuses--for example, various people
connected to Early Rain, including lawyers defending the
detained, reported ongoing detentions \86\ and
disappearances,\87\ denying detainees access to lawyers,\88\
and various forms of harassment, including physical assault,
eviction, cutting off utilities, death threats, and
surveillance.\89\ Authorities also tried to compel at least one
member to sign a statement renouncing the church.\90\
Officials in different localities violated believers'
freedom of religion by eliminating their options to join
unregistered churches, shutting down state-sanctioned churches,
and increasing control over remaining churches. In some cases,
unregistered house churches were pressured into joining the
state-sponsored Three-Self Patriotic Movement (TSPM)--a
national religious organization responsible for maintaining
political relations between the Protestant community and Party
and government leadership.\91\ In some areas, officials refused
to let churches register and demanded instead that individual
believers join already-established TSPM churches.\92\ In Henan,
even TSPM churches were ordered closed by officials, with most
of the 10,000 churches shut down in Henan in 2018 being state-
sponsored.\93\ For many of the remaining TSPM churches in Henan
and in other areas such as Beijing municipality, government
officials implemented measures subjecting congregations to
increased control, for example, by requiring the installation
of surveillance equipment inside church buildings.\94\
In many areas, local authorities required both TSPM and
house churches to demonstrate political loyalty to the Chinese
Communist Party and Chinese government, for example, by
requiring changes to church services to include singing the
national anthem and speeches by government officials, as well
as demanding that churches hang national flags, portraits of
President Xi, and posters listing ``socialist core values,''
while also ordering the removal of Christian symbols such as
crosses and signs with Christian messages.\95\ In parts of
Henan province, the prohibition on Christian symbols was
extended to the homes of believers.\96\
Falun Gong
As in previous years, authorities continued to detain Falun
Gong practitioners and subject them to harsh treatment.\97\ Due
to government suppression, it is difficult to determine the
number of Falun Gong practitioners in China.\98\ Chinese
authorities commonly prosecute Falun Gong practitioners under
Article 300 of the PRC Criminal Law; \99\ the Falun Gong-
affiliated website Clear Wisdom reported that at least 931
practitioners were sentenced under Article 300 in 2018, with
the greatest number sentenced in the northern provinces of
Liaoning, Shandong, Hebei, and Heilongjiang.\100\ In November
2018, two lawyers had their licenses to practice temporarily
suspended by the Ministry of Justice in Changsha municipality,
Hunan province, for arguments made in defense of Falun Gong
practitioners against Article 300 charges.\101\ International
human rights non-governmental organization Dui Hua Foundation
characterized the penalties as part of an incipient pattern of
official punishment of attorneys representing politically
sensitive clients that will likely discourage other criminal
defense lawyers from pursuing ``perfectly legal and effective
defense strategies.'' \102\ Clear Wisdom, an organization that
reports on the Falun Gong community, documented coercive and
violent practices against practitioners during custody,
including physical violence,\103\ forced drug
administration,\104\ sleep deprivation,\105\ and other forms of
torture.\106\ In February 2019, Clear Wisdom reported 69
confirmed deaths of Falun Gong practitioners in 2018 due to
abuse by officials.\107\
Islam
Violations of the religious freedom of the 10.5 million
\108\ Hui Muslim believers continued to intensify, with
observers raising alarm at an announcement in November 2018
that authorities in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region (Ningxia)
had signed an ``anti-terrorism'' cooperation agreement with
counterparts in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region
(XUAR).\109\ The agreement would apply ``anti-terrorism''
measures currently used in the XUAR to Ningxia--a region with a
high concentration of Hui Muslim believers.\110\ Ningxia
authorities announced in March 2019 that they would launch
``thorough inspections'' of religious venues and carried out
``innovative'' religious management measures, such as raising
national flags in mosques and organizing religious leaders to
study the Chinese Constitution, socialist core values, and
traditional classical Chinese culture.\111\ Local officials in
Weishan Yi and Hui Autonomous County, Dali Bai Autonomous
Prefecture, Yunnan province, reportedly accused Hui Muslim
believers of engaging in ``illegal religious activities'' and
forcibly evicted the local Muslim community from three mosques
in December 2018 before a planned demolition.\112\ [For more
information on Uyghur Muslim believers, see Section IV--
Xinjiang; for more information on Muslim believers of other
ethnic minority backgrounds, see Section II--Ethnic Minority
Rights.]
A five-year plan to ``sinicize'' Islam in China was passed
in January 2019.\113\ Meanwhile, ongoing policies included
measures requiring Islamic religious leaders and lay believers
to demonstrate their ``political reliability''--for example, to
be officially certified, imams and other religious personnel
must be educated at one of 10 state-sanctioned Islamic schools
or otherwise obtain equivalent education,\114\ and be vetted by
the local religious affairs bureau and the China Islamic
Association.\115\ After certification, religious leaders are
required to continue attending political training
sessions.\116\ All Chinese Muslims seeking to carry out the
Hajj pilgrimage must fulfill requirements for ``political
reliability,'' including taking ``patriotic education''
classes, obtaining the approval of their local religious
affairs bureau, and participating only through tours arranged
by the China Islamic Assocation.\117\
Other Religious Communities
Religious communities outside of the five religions that
are the main objects of official regulation \118\ continued to
exist in China, but the religious practice of communities that
previously received tacit recognition and support were subject
to repression over the last year. For example, although folk
religion was acknowledged in a 2018 white paper issued by the
State Council Information Office,\119\ authorities in Jiangsu
province launched a wide-scale campaign from February through
March 2019 to demolish over 5,900 temples of tudigong, a god
from traditional Chinese folk religion.\120\ Authorities also
destroyed religious iconography and filled in the mikveh (a
bath used for religious ceremonies) in a synagogue in Kaifeng
municipality, Henan province, and subjected the Jewish
community of less than 1,000 to other increased restrictions,
including the cancelation of plans for foreign support for the
local Jewish community.\121\

National Conference of Bishops (an organization led by Catholic
clergy), the Three-Self (for ``self-governing, self-financing, and

(the latter two organizations have overlapping membership and represent
Protestants). According to Goossaert and Palmer, although ``nominally
independent,'' the ``patriotic'' religious associations are effectively
under the authority of the State Council's agency for religious
affairs.

Findings
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year,
the Chinese Communist Party's United Front Work
Department continued to promote ethnic affairs work at
all levels of Party and state governance that
emphasized the importance of ``sinicizing'' ethnic and
religious minorities. Officials emphasized the need to
``sinicize'' the country's religions, including Islam.
Official ``sinicization'' efforts contributed to the
increasing marginalization of ethnic minorities and
their cultures and languages.
Reports indicate that official efforts to
repress Islamic practices in the Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous Region (XUAR) have spread beyond the XUAR to
Hui communities living in other locations. Developments
suggest officials may be starting to carry out
religious repression in areas outside of the XUAR that
are modeled on restrictions already implemented within
the XUAR. In November 2018, official media reported
that Zhang Yunsheng, Communist Party official of the
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, had signed a
counterterrorism agreement with XUAR officials during a
trip to the XUAR to learn about its efforts to fight
terrorism, maintain ``social stability,'' and manage
religious affairs.
During the reporting year, authorities carried
out the physical destruction and alteration of Hui
Muslim spaces and structures, continuing a recent trend
away from relative toleration of Hui Muslim faith
communities. Officials demolished a mosque in a Hui
community in Gansu province, raided and closed several
mosques in Hui areas in Yunnan province, closed an
Arabic-language school serving Hui students in Gansu,
and carried out changes such as removing Arabic signage
in Hui areas. These changes narrowed the space for Hui
Muslim believers to assert an ethnic and religious
identity distinct from that of the dominant Han Chinese
population.
Mongol herders in the Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region (IMAR) protested and petitioned the
government over the loss of traditional grazing lands.
As in past reporting years, authorities detained some
of the Mongol herders who peacefully protested.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Urge Chinese authorities to adopt a comprehensive
anti-discrimination law that includes a definition of
racial discrimination in full conformity with the
International Convention on the Elimination of All
Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD); to amend
Chinese domestic laws to expressly define and
criminalize all forms of racial discrimination in full
conformity with Article 1 of ICERD; and to expressly
prohibit both direct and indirect racial discrimination
in all fields of public life, including law enforcement
and other government powers.
Urge Chinese authorities to establish independent
national human rights institutions in accordance with
the Principles relating to the Status of National
Institutions for the Promotion and Protection of Human
Rights (the Paris Principles).
Urge Chinese authorities to formulate and establish
comprehensive statistics, surveys, and administrative
records on acts of racial discrimination and related
administrative and civil complaints, investigations,
procedures, and sanctions.
Urge Chinese authorities to allow Hui and other
predominantly Muslim ethnic minority populations to
freely engage in Islamic religious rituals, as a matter
of their right to religious freedom, and in accordance
with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
as well as China's Constitution, which prohibits
discrimination based on religion.
Call on the Chinese government to allow Mongol
herders to exercise their fundamental rights of freedom
of expression, association, and peaceful assembly, as
well as the right to be free from arbitrary detention.
Convey to Chinese officials the importance of
consulting with ethnic minority communities regarding
the impact of proposed development on their traditional
grazing lands.
Raise the cases of Mongol political prisoners,
including detained Mongol historian Lhamjab Borjigin
and detained Mongol writers O. Sechenbaatar and
Tsogjil, in public forums and meetings with Chinese
officials, and call for their immediate release from
detention.

Introduction
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year, Chinese
Communist Party and government authorities promoted policies
and regulations restricting rights guaranteed to ethnic
minority groups under Chinese and international law. The PRC
Regional Ethnic Autonomy Law contains protections for the
languages, religious beliefs, and customs of these
``nationalities,'' in addition to a system of regional autonomy
in designated areas.\1\ Article 27 of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, which China has signed
and declared its intention to ratify, contains safeguards for
the rights of ``ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities''
within a state.\2\ In practice, however, Chinese authorities
reportedly implemented policies that marginalized the cultures
and languages of ethnic minority populations.\3\ International
human rights organizations submitted reports in advance of the
November 2018 session of the UN Human Rights Council's
Universal Periodic Review that criticized China's controls on
ethnic minorities' religious freedom and cultural identity.\4\
[For additional information on ethnic minority rights, see
Section IV--Xinjiang and Section V--Tibet.]
Party and State ``Sinicization'' of Ethnic Minorities
During this reporting year, the Chinese Communist Party's
United Front Work Department (UFWD) continued to promote ethnic
affairs work at all levels of Party and state governance that
emphasized the importance of ``sinicizing'' ethnic and
religious minorities.\5\ The UFWD promoted an approach to
ethnic affairs that stressed ethnic unity; \6\ the ``five
identifications'' (wu ge rentong) (referring to identification
with the Chinese nation, the Chinese people, Chinese culture,
the Chinese Communist Party, and ``socialism with Chinese
characteristics''); \7\ the primacy of Mandarin Chinese; \8\ a
resistance to foreign culture; \9\ and the use of both material
assistance and propaganda efforts to manage ``ethnic
problems.'' \10\ At the March 2019 meetings of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing
municipality, officials emphasized the need to ``uphold the
Party's leadership over religious work [and] persist in
advancing the sinicization of our country's religions.'' \11\
During the March 2019 National People's Congress (NPC), Premier
Li Keqiang delivered the annual government work report, telling
NPC delegates that they must ``uphold the sinicization of
religion in China.'' \12\
Policies Affecting Hui Islamic Communities
Officials implemented policies and restrictions in Hui
communities in ways that represented intensified efforts to
promote the ``sinicization'' of ethnic and religious
minorities. In the past, Chinese officials have allowed Hui
Muslims to practice religion more freely than Uyghur or other
Turkic Muslims, but in recent years have placed more limits on
Hui Muslim traditions.\13\ International observers have
reported that official efforts to repress Islamic practices in
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) appear to have
spread beyond the XUAR to Hui communities living in other
locations.\14\ In November 2018, official media reported that
Zhang Yunsheng, Communist Party official of the Ningxia Hui
Autonomous Region, had signed a counterterrorism agreement with
XUAR officials during a trip to the XUAR to learn about its
efforts to fight terrorism, maintain ``social stability,'' and
manage religious affairs.\15\ A researcher for the NGO Human
Rights Watch expressed concern the agreement signaled that
officials would carry out religious repression in areas outside
of the XUAR modeled on restrictions already implemented within
the XUAR.\16\
During this reporting year, authorities carried out the
physical destruction and alteration of Hui Muslim spaces and
structures. Officials demolished a mosque in a Hui community in
Gansu province,\17\ raided and closed several mosques in Hui
areas in Yunnan province,\18\ and closed an Arabic-language
school serving Hui students in Gansu.\19\ Officials in
provinces with significant Hui populations promoted ``anti-
halal'' and ``sinicization'' efforts during the year, requiring
the removal of Arabic signage on buildings and crescent domes
on mosques, and also discontinued halal food standards, in
order to stop the spread of Islamic influences officials deemed
``foreign.'' \20\ In July, Reuters reported that officials in
Beijing municipality had ordered some local restaurants and
stores to remove words and symbols with Islamic significance
from their signage, including the word ``halal'' written in
Arabic.\21\ [For more information on freedom of religion for
Muslims in China, see Section II--Freedom of Religion.]
Grassland Protests in Inner Mongolia
During this reporting year, authorities detained Mongol
herders who protested or petitioned the government over the
loss of traditional grazing lands. As in past reporting
years,\22\ authorities detained some of the Mongol herders who
peacefully protested.\23\
Representative examples of protests and petitioning by
Mongol herders included the following:
2 In April 2019, authorities administratively
detained three Mongol herders who had traveled to
Hohhot municipality, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
(IMAR), to petition authorities over access to grazing
lands.\24\ Authorities escorted herders Haaserdun,
Tegshibayla, and Oobuuren back to their hometown in
Zaruud Banner, Tongliao municipality, IMAR, and ordered
them to serve eight days' administrative detention for
``picking quarrels and provoking trouble.'' \25\
On April 22, 2019, more than 100 Mongol
herders in Urad (Wulate) Middle Banner, Bayannur
(Bayannao'er) municipality, IMAR, protested in front of
local government offices to demand a meeting with IMAR
chairwoman Bu Xiaolin, who was visiting the area.\26\
Authorities detained around a dozen herders, including
Bai Xiurong and Altanbagan, each of whom security
personnel ordered to serve 14 days' administrative
detention for unknown charges.\27\ On the evening of
April 22 and the early morning of April 23, some of the
herders protested in front of a local government
building to call for the release of Bai, Altanbagan,
and other herders still detained.\28\
Detention of Mongol Writers
Authorities in the IMAR tried a Mongol historian on charges
related to a book he wrote and detained two Mongol writers who
had advocated on behalf of herders' rights:
Lhamjab Borjigin. On April 4, 2019, the
Xilingol (Xilinguole) League Intermediate People's
Court in Xilinhot city, Xilingol League, tried 75-year-
old Mongol historian Lhamjab Borjigin on the charges of
``ethnic separatism,'' ``sabotaging national unity,''
and ``illegal publication and illegal distribution.''
\29\ A Xilinhot official previously linked the first
two charges to a book Borjigin self-published in 2006
about Mongols' experiences during the Cultural
Revolution.\30\
O. Sechenbaatar. On April 12, 2019, security
personnel in Heshigten (Keshenketeng) Banner, Chifeng
municipality, detained 68-year-old Mongol writer O.
Sechenbaatar on suspicion of ``obstructing official
business,'' after he participated in a nearby protest
involving more than 200 herders over government plans
to restrict local herders' access to traditional
grazing lands.\31\ Sechenbaatar has authored numerous
books and other materials on Mongolian culture, and he
has hosted group discussions about Mongol herders'
concerns on the messaging service WeChat.\32\ On April
16, 2019, more than 100 herders protested in front of a
government building in Heshigten to call for O.
Sechenbaatar's release from detention.\33\
Tsogjil. On April 16, 2019, security personnel
in Hohhot took into custody 40-year-old Mongol writer
Tsogjil, and authorities subsequently took him back to
his hometown in Heshigten Banner, and detained him on
April 17 on the charge of ``picking quarrels and
provoking trouble.'' \34\ According to a U.S.-based
Mongol rights organization, prior to his detention,
Tsogjil had advocated for Mongols' language and
cultural rights, as well as their access to natural
resources, including by hosting WeChat discussion
groups.\35\ Tsogjil had traveled to Hohhot to submit a
complaint to regional government officials regarding
Mongol herders' rights.\36\

Population Control
Findings
To address demographic concerns and spur
population growth, the Chinese Communist Party and
government relaxed the family planning policy in 2016
to allow all married couples to have two children. The
``universal two-child policy,'' however, remained a
birth limit policy, and the Commission continued to
observe reports of official coercion committed against
women and their families during this reporting year.
Chinese authorities threatened or imposed punishments
on families for illegal pregnancies and births, using
methods including heavy fines, job termination, and
abortion.
Chinese authorities implemented the
``universal two-child policy'' for a fourth consecutive
year in 2019, and the latest government statistics
showed that the policy's effect was limited. The
National Bureau of Statistics of China data showed that
the total number of births in 2018--reportedly the
lowest since 1961--dropped by 2 million in comparison
to the 2017 figure. This decline is much larger than
what some population experts had predicted. In 2018,
China's fertility rate remained around 1.6 births per
woman, below the replacement rate of 2.1 births per
woman necessary to maintain a stable population. The
birth rate was 10.94 per 1,000 persons, reportedly the
lowest since 1949 when the People's Republic of China
was founded. The working-age population continued its
seventh consecutive decline by 4.7 million, while the
elderly population increased by 8.59 million. China's
overall sex ratio in 2018 was 104.64 males to 100
females, and there were approximately 31.64 million
more males than females in China.
This reporting year, central government
authorities rejected calls to end birth restrictions,
despite population experts and National People's
Congress delegates voicing demographic, economic, and
human rights concerns over China's population control
policies. Experts urged the Chinese government to
implement policies, including financial incentives and
other forms of assistance, to encourage couples to have
children. If not adequately addressed, China's decades-
long birth limit policies and resultant demographic
challenges could weaken China's economy and political
stability.
The Chinese government's restrictive family
planning policies have exacerbated China's sex ratio
imbalance, which reportedly has fueled the demand for
foreign women and resulted in human trafficking for
forced marriage and commercial sexual exploitation.
Four decades of China's population control
policies combined with a traditional preference for
sons may have encouraged a black market for illegal
adoptions. This past year, the Commission observed a
new trend in which pregnant foreign women sold their
newborn children in China for illegal adoption.
One former mass internment camp detainee in
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) alleged
that authorities sterilized her without her knowledge
while she was in detention. Two former detainees
reported that camp authorities forced female detainees
to take unknown medications and injected them with
unknown substances, after which the women ceased
menstruating.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Highlight the looming demographic challenges
currently facing China in bilateral meetings with
Chinese government officials--including a rapidly aging
population, shrinking workforce, and sex ratio
imbalance; and emphasize that these demographic trends
could harm China's economy if not addressed in a timely
manner by ending as soon as possible all birth
restrictions imposed on families.
Use authorities provided in the Foreign Relations
Authorization Act of 2000 (Public Law No. 106-113) and
the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act
(Public Law No. 114-328) to deny entry into the United
States and impose sanctions against Chinese officials
who have been directly involved in the formulation,
implementation, or enforcement of China's coercive
family planning policies, including those who have
forced men and women to undergo sterilizations and
abortions.
Call on China's central and local governments to
vigorously enforce provisions of Chinese law that
provide for punishment of officials and other
individuals who engage in these abuses.
Publicly link, with supporting evidence, the sex
ratio imbalance exacerbated by China's population
control policies with regional humanitarian and
security concerns--human trafficking, crime, increased
internal and external migration, and other possible
serious social, economic, and political problems--and
discuss and address these issues in bilateral and
multilateral dialogues.
Call on officials in the XUAR to address allegations
of the forced sterilization of mass internment camp
detainees; and call on officials to respond to accounts
that authorities subjected female camp detainees to the
forced injection of unknown substances and forced
ingestion of unknown medication that disrupted their
menstrual cycles.

International Standards and China's Coercive Population Policies
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year, Chinese
authorities continued to implement coercive population control
policies that violate international standards. Starting in
2016, the Chinese Communist Party and government relaxed birth
restrictions and implemented the ``universal two-child
policy.'' \1\ The ``universal two-child policy,'' however,
continued to impose birth limits as the PRC Population and
Family Planning Law and provincial-level regulations restrict
married couples to having two children.\2\ Exceptions allowing
for additional children exist for couples who meet certain
criteria, which vary by province, including some exceptions for
ethnic minorities,\3\ remarried couples, and couples who have
children with disabilities.\4\ Despite population experts and
National People's Congress delegates voicing their concerns
over China's population policy on demographic and human rights
grounds, central government authorities rejected calls to end
birth limits during this reporting year.\5\ Local-level
officials reportedly continued to enforce compliance with
family planning policies using methods including heavy
fines,\6\ job termination,\7\ and coerced abortion.\8\
Coercive controls imposed on women and their families, as
well as additional abuses engendered by China's population and
family planning system, violate standards set forth in the 1995
Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the 1994
Programme of Action of the Cairo International Conference on
Population and Development.\9\ China was a state participant in
the negotiation and adoption of both documents.\10\ Acts of
official coercion committed in the implementation of population
control policies also contravene provisions of the Convention
against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment
or Punishment,\11\ which China has ratified.\12\
Coercive Implementation and Punishment for Noncompliance
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year, the Commission
continued to observe reports of coercive enforcement of family
planning policies. The PRC Population and Family Planning Law
contains provisions that prohibit officials from infringing
upon the ``legitimate rights and interests'' of citizens while
implementing family planning policies.\13\ Some provincial-
level population planning regulations, however, continued to
explicitly instruct officials to carry out abortions--often
referred to as ``remedial measures'' (bujiu cuoshi)--for
unsanctioned pregnancies.\14\ Some local government authorities
emphasized in official reports the need to prevent and control
illegal pregnancies and births, and instructed family planning
officials to carry out the invasive ``three inspections''
(intrauterine device (IUD), pregnancy, and health inspections)
and ``four procedures'' (IUD insertion, first trimester
abortion, mid- to late-term abortion, and sterilization).\15\
For example, a government report from Dalu township, Qionghai
city, Hainan province, stated that local authorities carried
out in total 264 ``four procedures'' operations in 2018.\16\
The same report also touted that local authorities had a
success rate of 83 percent in detecting pregnancies within the
first six months of the gestation period and reached 100.5
percent of their family planning work targets.\17\
Chinese authorities also continued to use various methods
of punishment to enforce citizens' compliance with family
planning policies. In accordance with national-level legal
provisions,\18\ local provisions and governments have directed
officials to punish noncompliance through heavy fines, termed
``social compensation fees'' (shehui fuyang fei), which are
often much greater than the average annual income in localities
across China.\19\ In addition to fines, officials imposed or
threatened other punishments for family planning violations
that included job termination \20\ and abortion.\21\ The PRC
Population and Family Planning Law prohibits, and provides
punishments for, infringement by officials on citizens'
personal, property, and other rights while implementing family
planning policies.\22\
CASES OF COERCION
In March 2019, authorities in Yuncheng district, Yunfu
municipality, Guangdong province, reportedly dismissed a female
public school teacher, surnamed Xie, from her job for giving
birth to a third child in violation of China's two-child
policy.\23\ Earlier in December 2018, authorities also
dismissed Xie's husband from his job, reportedly leaving the
family in a dire financial situation.\24\ Xie became pregnant
in June 2018, and local authorities from various government
agencies pressured her--a total of 14 times--to terminate her
pregnancy or face losing her job.\25\ Xie refused and gave
birth to her third child in January 2019.\26\ She argued that
authorities' administrative actions were illegal and violated
several provincial and national laws and regulations.\27\ As of
June 2019, the Commission had not observed any update on the
case.
According to Chinese and international reports, shortly
before the lunar new year in January 2019, local authorities in
Chengwu county, Heze municipality, Shandong province, froze the
financial accounts and work pay of a couple surnamed Wang,
because they had failed to pay ``social compensation fees'' in
the amount of 64,626 yuan (approximately US$9,500).\28\ The
couple, however, had approximately 23,000 yuan (approximately
US$3,300) in their accounts, with the remaining balance still
due.\29\ Authorities had fined the couple for the January 2017
birth of their third child, which violated national law and
local family planning regulations.\30\ The Wangs were
reportedly in a dire financial situation as a result of the
account freeze.\31\

Report of Forced Sterilization in Mass Internment Camps in the Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mihrigul Tursun. According to international media, authorities in the
XUAR forcibly sterilized ethnic Uyghur Mihrigul Tursun without her
knowledge while she was detained in a mass internment camp in the XUAR.
Authorities detained Tursun three times in mass internment camps and
other facilities, for a total of 10 months.\32\ Tursun said authorities
at a mass internment camp where she was held forced her and other
detainees to swallow unknown pills and drink ``some kind of white
liquid,'' and injected them with unknown substances.\33\ According to
Tursun, the white liquid halted menstruation in some detainees and
caused severe bleeding in others.\34\ Following her release from
custody \35\ and arrival in the United States, doctors confirmed that
she had been sterilized.\36\ Gulbahar Jelilova, an ethnic Uyghur woman
detained in a mass internment camp in the XUAR, also said that doctors
repeatedly injected female detainees with an unknown substance that
stopped their menstruation.\37\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Universal Two-Child Policy
To address demographic challenges facing China, the Party
and government implemented the ``universal two-child policy''
in 2016 to boost population growth,\38\ but government
statistics showed that the policy's effect was limited. In
2016, the former National Health and Family Planning Commission
had predicted that the universal two-child policy would result
in population growth,\39\ with an estimated total of 17.5 to 21
million children born per year during the 13th Five-Year Plan
period (2016-2020).\40\ According to a January 2019 National
Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) report, however, the number
of total births in 2018 was 15.23 million--reportedly the
lowest since 1961 \41\--showing a decline of 2 million births
in comparison to the 2017 figure of 17.23 million.\42\ This
decline is much larger than the range of 300,000 to 800,000
annual drop that some population experts predicted.\43\ Yi
Fuxian, a prominent U.S.-based demographic expert, disagreed
with the official NBS report and suggested that the total
births in 2018 may have been as low as 10.3 million.\44\
Some experts argued that the universal two-child policy did
have a short-term effect of encouraging births and stabilizing
the birth rate.\45\ This effect was evidenced by the one-time
increase of 1.31 million births in 2016, and in the first few
years of the ``universal two-child policy,'' over 50 percent of
new births reportedly were second children.\46\ Experts noted,
however, that these phenomena were likely caused by a temporary
``pile-up effect,'' as many women nearing the end of their
childbearing age rushed to give birth to a second child after
the two-child policy became effective in 2016.\47\ As this
``pile-up effect'' is unsustainable, experts predicted that
beginning in 2018, the annual newborn population would rapidly
decline further.\48\ Some experts attributed the decline in
births to the shrinking number of women of childbearing age
\49\ and the reluctance on the part of many married couples to
have children owing to concerns such as the high cost of
rearing a child,\50\ the lack of adequate child care and
education options,\51\ and the potential disruption to career
development.\52\
As the ``universal two-child policy'' failed to boost
population growth for a second consecutive year, population
experts and National People's Congress (NPC) delegates, citing
demographic and economic challenges, as well as human rights
concerns, called on the Chinese government to end all birth
restrictions imposed on Chinese families. Experts noted that
China's decades-long birth limit policies and resultant
demographic challenges, which include a rapidly aging
population and a shrinking workforce, could weaken China's
economy and political stability.\53\ Falling fertility in the
past two years shows that the existing universal two-child
policy may not adequately mitigate China's demographic
challenges, causing experts and NPC delegates to call on
Chinese authorities to abolish all birth restrictions.\54\
Experts also warned that even if all birth restrictions are
removed, it may not stop the trend of a falling birth rate and
population decline, especially if it is not supplemented by
policies that encourage births.\55\ Experts urged the Chinese
government to provide financial incentives, such as tax breaks,
subsidies, and other forms of assistance to encourage couples
to have more children.\56\
In addition to demographic concerns, some experts also
emphasized that Chinese government authorities should respect
and protect citizens' human rights and not intrude on their
private reproductive lives.\57\ In an August 2018 China Daily
interview, Zhang Juwei, Director of the Institute of Population
and Labor Economics at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
said that it is ``inappropriate'' to control population size
for the sake of ``boosting economic and social development . .
. because reproductive rights are the fundamental rights of
families.'' \58\
This past year, central government authorities rejected
calls to end all birth restrictions imposed on Chinese
families. In a written statement posted in January 2019, the
National Health Commission (NHC) rejected an NPC recommendation
of abolishing the birth limit policy, stating that ``it is not
appropriate to immediately and completely remove the `family
planning [policy],' '' as it is still a law and policy mandated
in China's Constitution.\59\ In a separate response to the NPC,
the NHC reiterated that Chinese family planning authorities
will continue to impose ``social compensation fees'' on couples
who violate the two-child policy.\60\
Demographic and Humanitarian Consequences of Population Control
Policies
Four decades of population control policies have
exacerbated China's demographic challenges, which include a
rapidly aging population, shrinking workforce, and sex ratio
imbalance. Affected in recent decades by government
restrictions on the number of births per couple, China's total
fertility rate has dropped from approximately 3 births per
woman in the late 1970s \61\ to an estimated 1.6 births per
woman in 2018, below the replacement rate of 2.1 births per
woman necessary to maintain a stable population.\62\ Some
reports suggested that the fertility rate in 2018 may have been
as low as 1.02 births per woman.\63\ In addition, the National
Bureau of Statistics of China (NBS) reported that China's birth
rate in 2018 was 10.94 per 1,000 persons in the population,
reportedly the lowest since the founding of the People's
Republic of China in 1949.\64\
China's low fertility rate and birth rate have contributed
to a rapidly aging population and a shrinking workforce.
According to the NBS, from 2017 to 2018, China's working-age
population (persons between the ages of 16 and 59) declined by
4.7 million to 897.29 million, continuing a downward trend for
a seventh consecutive year.\65\ During the same period, the
elderly population (persons aged 60 or older) increased by 8.59
million in 2018 to 249.49 million, or 17.9 percent of the total
population.\66\ According to the State Council National
Population Development Plan (2016-2030), China's working-age
population is expected to decline rapidly from 2021 to 2030,
while the elderly population will increase markedly during the
same period and is predicted to reach a quarter of the
population by 2030.\67\ By 2050, the elderly population is
expected to account for approximately one-third of China's
total population,\68\ while the working-age population is
expected to decrease by 200 million.\69\ These demographic
trends reportedly may burden China's healthcare, social
services, and pension systems,\70\ and could bring adverse
effects to China's economy.\71\
The Chinese government's restrictive family planning
policies have also exacerbated China's sex ratio imbalance,
which reportedly fueled the demand for foreign women and
contributed to human trafficking. Although Chinese authorities
continued to implement a ban on ``non-medically necessary sex
determination and sex-selective abortion,'' \72\ some people
reportedly continued the practice in keeping with a traditional
cultural preference for sons.\73\ According to a January 2019
NBS report, China's overall sex ratio in 2018 was 104.64 males
to 100 females, and there were approximately 31.64 million more
males than females in China (713.51 million males to 681.87
million females).\74\ The NBS reported that the sex ratio at
birth (SRB) in 2015 was 113.51 males to 100 females,\75\ but it
did not provide statistics on the SRB since 2016 when the
universal two-child policy was implemented.\76\ Demographic
experts have long expressed concerns that the sex ratio
imbalance in China could lead to an increase in crime,\77\
trafficking of women,\78\ and social instability.\79\ This past
year, international media reports continued to suggest a link
between China's sex ratio imbalance and the trafficking of
foreign women--from countries including Burma (Myanmar),
Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Pakistan, and Vietnam--into China
for forced marriage or commercial sexual exploitation.\80\ [For
more information on cross-border trafficking, see Section II--
Human Trafficking.]
Decades of birth limits under China's population control
policies combined with a traditional preference for sons may
also have encouraged a black market for illegal adoptions.\81\
This reporting year, the Commission observed a new trend in
which foreign women sold their newborn children in China for
illegal adoption.\82\ According to Vietnamese news media
reports, Vietnamese authorities detained and investigated
individuals suspected of moving pregnant women across the
border into China to sell newborn children.\83\ In the
Vietnamese province of Nghe An alone, there were at least 27
pregnant women who had traveled to China to sell their newborns
in 2018.\84\ [For inconsistencies in the definition of ``human
trafficking'' between Chinese law and international standards,

Anti-Crime and
Vice Campaign
Anti-Crime and
Vice Campaign
Special Topic: Migrant Neighborhoods a Target of Anti-Crime and Vice
Campaign
Findings
An anti-crime campaign launched by central
authorities in 2018 is being used to target
marginalized groups in China. Called the ``Specialized
Struggle to Sweep Away Organized Crime and Eliminate
Vice,'' the stated aims of the three-year campaign
include guaranteeing China's lasting political
stability and consolidating the foundation of the
Chinese Communist Party's authoritative power.
The Commission observed reports of local
governments invoking this anti-crime campaign to target
groups of people including petitioners (individuals who
seek redress from the government), religious believers,
village election candidates, lawyers, and internal
migrants.
Municipal governments carried out large-scale
evictions and demolitions of internal migrant
neighborhoods in the name of the anti-crime campaign.
These localities appear to be using the campaign to
achieve the goals of a central government plan to
``renovate'' urban villages across China by 2020. Urban
villages are municipal neighborhoods that are
categorized as rural under China's household
registration (hukou) system. Registered residents of
these urban villages often rent to internal migrants,
who have hukou from other localities and face
discrimination in housing, education, and the provision
of government services.
In addition to evictions and demolitions of
internal migrant neighborhoods, local governments have
also invoked the anti-crime campaign to justify
increasing monitoring and surveillance of internal
migrant neighborhoods. For example, in Xi'an
municipality, public security officers investigated
over 800 internal migrant communities and over 400
urban villages under the local ``2019 Thunder Strike
and Iron Fist Anti-Crime and Vice Operation.''
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Call on Chinese authorities to end forced evictions,
demolitions, and heightened surveillance of internal
migrant communities across China, and to follow both
international and Chinese law in providing adequate
notice, compensation, and assistance to residents when
public safety requires demolishing dangerous
structures.
Encourage the Chinese government to expand both the
rights of migrant workers in China, and the space for
civil society organizations that provide social
services and legal assistance to internal migrants.
Note that improving the rights of internal migrants and
expanding their access to social services would likely
lower the chances of spontaneous, large-scale protests,
while large-scale forced evictions, demolitions, and
surveillance could increase the likelihood of such
protests.
Call on Chinese authorities to accelerate reforms to
the hukou system, including lowering restrictions on
migration to major cities and centers of economic
opportunity; equalizing the level and quality of public

Anti-Crime and
Vice Campaign
Anti-Crime and
Vice Campaign
Special Topic: Migrant Neighborhoods a Target of Anti-Crime and Vice
Campaign
Introduction
This past year, the Commission observed reports of local
authorities in jurisdictions across China targeting internal
migrants, petitioners, religious groups, and others with
increased monitoring and other forms of repression. In many
cases, local authorities tied these actions to a central-level
Chinese Communist Party and government campaign called the
``Specialized Struggle to Sweep Away Organized Crime and
Eliminate Vice'' (Saohei Chu'e Zhuanxiang Douzheng, or the
``anti-crime and vice campaign''). This section will examine
the origins and broad application of this campaign, with a
special focus on how lower-level Party and government officials
used the campaign to justify increased monitoring of internal
migrants and large-scale evictions and demolitions of migrant
neighborhoods.
On January 23, 2018, the Communist Party Central Committee
and the State Council announced the commencement of a three-
year national anti-crime and vice campaign in the form of a
centrally issued circular. Authorities did not make the
circular publicly available, but the central government news
agency Xinhua provided a summary of the circular.\1\ According
to that summary, the four stated aims of the campaign are:
guaranteeing the people's contentment in life
and work,
social stability and orderliness,
China's lasting political stability,\2\ and
further consolidating the foundation of
Communist Party rule.\3\
A Chinese academic observed that the campaign is intended
to bring greater legitimacy to the Party's governance by
increasing central Party and government officials' control over
local government, which is often otherwise dominated by
``grass-roots leaders'' of villages and enterprises.\4\ A Party
official announced that by the end of March 2019, authorities
had prosecuted 79,018 people as part of the campaign.\5\
According to state-run media outlet Xinhua, the Party has
directed the campaign to focus on ``key areas, key industries,
and key sectors with prominent problems of crime and vice,''
\6\ and the Ministry of Public Security emphasized that the
campaign must include the ``modernization of social management
at the grassroots level to eradicate the breeding grounds of
crime and vice'' (chanchu hei'e shili zisheng turang).\7\ This
broad mandate has provided local authorities with large
discretion to target various types of groups and conduct,
leading international media \8\ as well as the Central
Commission for Discipline and Inspection to openly criticize
the broad application of the campaign at the local level.\9\
Local authorities across China have invoked the campaign to
restrict the freedoms of a wide range of marginalized groups.
For example, a number of local governments have specifically
named petitioners--individuals with grievances seeking redress
from the government--as targets of the campaign.\10\ Some local
governments reportedly increased monitoring and suppression of
religious groups in the name of the anti-crime and vice
campaign, with officials asking residents to report on members
of religious groups that are not officially registered.\11\
Authorities excluded 51,000 individuals from running in village
elections as part of the anti-crime and vice campaign, claiming
some of these individuals had suspected ties to organized crime
or ``did not meet criteria'' such as ``excellent political
quality.'' \12\ Authorities have also used the campaign to
suppress ethnic minority groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous Region and the Tibet Autonomous Region.\13\ [For
more information on how government officials have used this
campaign against religious believers, ethnic minority groups,
petitioners, and other groups, see Section II--Freedom of
Religion, Section IV--Xinjiang, and Section V--Tibet.]
Also as part of the campaign, some local governments
increased monitoring of ``urban villages'' (chengzhong cun)
that are often areas with large populations of internal
migrants.\14\ Local municipal governments have sought to
demolish these urban villages, sometimes referred to as
``slums'' (penghu qu) by government sources, as part of a
national plan to ``renovate'' (gaizao) all urban villages by
2020.\15\ Some local government documents specifically point to
urban villages and neighborhoods with large numbers of migrant
workers as areas with ``crime and vice forces'' (hei e
shili).\16\ One example of increased monitoring of migrant
communities this past year as part of the anti-crime and vice
campaign is Xi'an's ``2019 Thunder Strike and Iron Fist Anti-
Crime and Vice Operation'' (lei ting tie wan saohei chu'e
xingdong) that involved public security officers investigating
over 800 internal migrant communities and over 400 urban
villages.\17\

Urban Village Eviction, Demolition, and Surveillance under the Anti-
Crime and Vice Campaign: Yuhuazhai in Xi'an
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In October 2018, local officials of the Xi'an Hi-Tech Industries
Development Zone (Xi'an Hi-Tech Zone), Xi'an municipality, Shaanxi
province, initiated an eviction and demolition campaign followed by a
large-scale inspection and registration of remaining businesses and
residents as part of local implementation of the national ``anti-crime
and vice campaign'' in February 2019.\18\ The campaign targeted
Yuhuazhai village in Yanta district, Xi'an, itself a collection of
eight urban villages \19\ with a local official reporting more than
100,000 internal migrant residents compared with 9,000 residents with
local residence permits--leading to numerous rights abuses and several
deaths.\20\ The campaign was led by the Xi'an Hi-Tech Zone Management
Committee and largely state-owned education technology company China Hi-
Tech Group,\21\ acting jointly with over 20 government agencies to
``thoroughly renovate, evict, and demolish'' residences and local
enterprises within the village.\22\ China Business News reporters
observed that in October 2018, the Xi'an Hi-Tech Zone Management
Committee reportedly held a competition among ten districts and
townships over the acquisition of more than 33 square kilometers of
land, scoring them on categories including whole-village demolition,
barrier removal, and pollution reduction.\23\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Urban Village Eviction, Demolition, and Surveillance under the Anti-
Crime and Vice Campaign: Yuhuazhai in Xi'an--Continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Local officials reportedly hired several thousand people--some
allegedly members of criminal syndicates--to harass and assault
residents,\24\ resulting in at least one death,\25\ as well as to
demolish commercial establishments in October.\26\ Officials gave
businesses and residents notice on the same day of the demolition,
thereby depriving them of the opportunity to seek judicial or
administrative review and denying entrance to those without residence
permits so that many were unable to recover their personal
property.\27\ In November, residents reportedly protested continued
demolitions and faced violence from people in local security
uniforms.\28\ Demolition campaigns reportedly were also planned for 116
villages in and around Xi'an, with 62 scheduled to begin within
2019.\29\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Vulnerability of Internal Migrants and Household Registration Policies
Chinese authorities have a history of carrying out forced
evictions \30\ that affect migrant workers in particular.
International rights organizations documented widespread forced
evictions prior to the 2008 Beijing Olympics and Expo 2010 in
Shanghai municipality.\31\ In late 2017 and early 2018, in
response to two fatal fires in migrant neighborhoods,\32\
authorities in Beijing municipality and the surrounding areas
launched a campaign of large-scale forced evictions and
demolitions in migrant neighborhoods across the region.\33\
Residents reportedly were given days or hours to leave.\34\
Chinese migrant workers continued to be marginalized
because of their residency status under the household
registration (hukou) system. The hukou system, established in
1958,\35\ classified Chinese citizens as being urban or rural
and effectively tied them to a locality.\36\ According to the
National Bureau of Statistics of China, in 2018, 286 million
people in China did not live in their hukou location.\37\ Yet
provision of certain government services, such as education,
remains tied to one's hukou location, which is, in general,
inherited from one's parents.\38\ The hukou system reportedly
also exacerbates these migrants' vulnerability to exploitation
in China's workforce.\39\ [For more information on forced
labor, see Section II--Human Trafficking.]
In 2014, the government began to reform the hukou system to
gradually eliminate the urban-rural distinction and allow some
migrants to obtain hukou in smaller cities.\40\ In April 2019,
the National Development and Reform Commission required cities
with populations of 1 to 3 million to eliminate all
restrictions on obtaining hukou, yet restrictions remained in
cities with populations above 3 million, such as Xi'an and
Beijing,\41\ and the government continues to use the hukou
system to restrict internal migration.\42\
In 2014, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural
Rights urged China ``to ensure that any relocation necessary
for city renewal is carried out after prior consultation with
the affected individuals . . ..'' \43\ In 2018, the UN
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination was
concerned by reports that changes to the hukou system ``have
not made substantial positive changes for many rural migrants,
including ethnic minorities.'' \44\
Actions taken by Chinese government officials enforcing the
eviction campaign throughout China contravene both
international standards \45\ and Chinese law.\46\ Restrictions
on movement and discrimination arising from the hukou system
contravene international human rights standards guaranteeing
freedom of residence.\47\

Findings
Women in China face severe discrimination
throughout their careers, from job recruitment and
hiring to wages and promotions. Such disparities have
increased over the current period of economic reform
that began in 1978, accelerating during the 2000s with
the intensification of market liberalization. Gender
biases and sexual harassment in the workplace are major
factors contributing to the employment gender gap, as
well as national laws mandating parental leave and
other entitlements for women and not men. These laws
enforce the role of women as caregivers and have led
employers to avoid hiring women without children in
order to avoid the cost of these legal entitlements.
Following widely publicized grassroots
campaigns highlighting challenges faced by women in the
workplace, Chinese officials initiated policies to
address gender discrimination in employment, including
creating a cause of action for disputes over employment
discrimination and sexual harassment and a series of
policies aimed primarily at punishing employers for
discriminatory job recruitment practices. Nonetheless,
inadequate enforcement and discriminatory laws persist;
local bureaus responsible for enforcement seldom take
punitive action in response to complaints, and some
laws themselves continue to discriminate against women
by barring them from performing certain jobs.
Thirty percent of women have experienced some
form of domestic violence, yet nearly three years after
the passage of the PRC Anti-Domestic Violence Law in
March 2016, Chinese courts had only issued a total of
3,718 protective orders by December 2018. News media
and expert analysis noted that cultural norms that do
not recognize domestic violence as a crime contributed
to the low number of reported incidents, with family
members and police commonly discouraging victims from
going forward with requesting protective orders or
divorce.
Despite official repression, independent
public advocacy for women's rights continues to
influence public discourse and policy. Public advocacy
in recent years has highlighted gender inequities in
recruitment and sexual harassment, while news media and
civil society actors have noted a connection to the
issues publicly addressed by national officials this
year as a sign that independent advocacy is having an
impact even as it has been severely suppressed.
Chinese officials continued censoring online
discussion of topics related to feminism and harassing
and threatening individual citizens engaging in
advocacy. These restrictions were a continuation of the
official repression of women's rights advocacy
beginning in 2015.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Publicly and privately urge the Chinese government to
respect the freedom of expression and assembly of all
rights advocates, and in particular to refrain from
harassing and intimidating the independent rights
advocates seeking to increase awareness about sexual
harassment in public areas.
Urge the Chinese government to publicly expand its
commitment to gender equality through measures such as
increasing the number of women in the highest levels of
political leadership, instituting gender equality and
anti-harassment trainings in government workplaces, and
challenging discriminatory attitudes based on gender
through public education.
Commend the Chinese government for recent legal
developments aimed at promoting the welfare of women
and gender equality. These include the inclusion of a
gender discrimination case among the Supreme People's
Court's guiding cases and the creation of causes of
action allowing plaintiffs to sue for sexual harassment
and gender discrimination in employment. Encourage the
government to strengthen formal support services for
implementation--for example, by increasing funding for
health services or shelters for women experiencing
violence, providing funding and support for lawyers for
legal services, and allowing independent lawyers and
advocates to assist with the promotion and
implementation of laws related to gender equality
through lawsuits and public campaigns.
Support international exchanges among academics,
legal advocates, non-governmental organizations, and
others that focus on the implementation and enforcement
of recently adopted laws promoting gender equity. In
particular, facilitate and support technical assistance
programs that would help all those working in law
enforcement and the judiciary to implement the PRC
Anti-Domestic Violence Law effectively and challenge
discriminatory attitudes. As the first point of
contact, law enforcement in particular should be
trained in addressing reports of violence in a way that
does not undermine victims' concerns or safety. Urge
provincial level officials to implement provincial
regulations according to the PRC Anti-Domestic Violence
Law.
Facilitate and support technical assistance programs
that would help the development of gender equality
education in schools and communities.
Encourage the collection and analysis of data on
disparities in economic and social life based on gender
so as to monitor changes.

Discrimination in Employment
Although international human rights standards prohibit
discrimination on the basis of gender,\1\ women in China
continued to face serious obstacles to equal treatment in
employment.
Women in China face severe discrimination
throughout their careers, from job recruitment and
hiring to wages and promotions. Surveys have found that
recruitment listings frequently indicate a preference
or requirement for men,\2\ with 35 percent of civil
servant job listings for 2019 containing gender
specifications despite national laws prohibiting gender
discrimination in hiring.\3\ Women continued to be
represented in the top leadership of only 20.1 percent
of Chinese firms and political institutions while
earning on average 64.3 percent of what men earned,
according to the World Economic Forum's 2018 Global
Gender Gap Report.\4\ An International Labour
Organization (ILO) study conducted in 2015 noted that
such disparities have increased over the current period
of economic reform that began in 1978,\5\ accelerating
during the 2000s with the intensification of market
liberalization.\6\ A survey by Chinese online recruiter
Boss Zhipin Major found that three major reasons for
the gender disparity in workplace advancement were the
comparatively greater share of domestic obligations
shouldered by women, their lack of outside connections
and social support, and underdeveloped management
skills.\7\
National laws mandating parental leave and
other entitlements for women and not men are a major
reason for discriminatory hiring and dismissal. Male
employees are not legally entitled to parental leave,
but employers are required to grant female employees 98
days of parental leave by the Law on the Protection of
Women's Rights and Interests in addition to other
parental benefits required only for women, such as
allowances and termination restrictions.\8\ One scholar
notes that these laws enforce the role of women as
caregivers and have led employers to avoid hiring women
without children in order to avoid the cost of these
legal entitlements.\9\ One expert reported that women
perceive such discrimination against them to have
increased since the implementation of the ``universal
two-child policy'' in January 2016, which generally
allows couples to have two children, somewhat loosening
the restrictions under the former ``one-child policy.''
\10\ [For more information on the ``universal two-child
policy,'' see Section II--Population Control.]
The national parental leave policy is also a
major factor in pregnancy discrimination. Gender
inequality in parental leave has led to a rise in the
number of labor disputes filed by female employees
against their employers for dismissing them or treating
them negatively as a result of reporting their
pregnancies.\11\ Some employers require female
employees to submit applications to have children or
assign them to a ``queue,'' dismissing or otherwise
pressuring those who have children out of turn.\12\
Such negative treatment is prohibited by national
laws,\13\ but employers also retaliated against those
who attempted to vindicate their legal rights. For
example, in December 2018, an employer in Changchun
municipality, Jilin province, assigned one employee to
work alone at a site without toilet facilities after
she obtained a judgment declaring that her employer
should continue her employment contract when she sued
over pressure to leave her position upon reporting that
she was pregnant.\14\
Gender biases and sexual harassment in the
workplace also contribute to the employment gender gap.
Legal entitlements associated with reproduction and
parenthood do not fully explain the gender gap in
employment: A 2018 study by Renmin University in
Beijing municipality found that employers were actually
less likely to hire women for important positions if
they already had two children--and thus were ineligible
for parental benefits.\15\ A 2015 ILO study attributed
most of the wage differential to discrimination,\16\
and Chinese officials have also acknowledged the
negative effect of gender discrimination on female
workforce participation.\17\ A 2018 study found
discriminatory and sexualized views of women were
common in job recruitment advertisements, reflecting
assumptions that women are less qualified for work
requiring strength, intelligence, or mental fitness
\18\ and that employers may use the physical
attractiveness of female employees as a condition of
employment or as an inducement for recruiting male
employees.\19\ Such assumptions continue to affect
women's well-being and careers once they are in the
workplace: A 2018 survey of social media posts and
interactions of female civil servants found consistent
accounts of sexualized and demeaning behavior from
supervisors that included requiring female civil
servants to provide companionship in settings (e.g.,
restaurants, karaoke bars) where they would be sexually
harassed.\20\
After a year of social media campaigns
highlighting sexual harassment cases garnering
significant public attention,\21\ national-level
officials announced policies to address sexual
harassment and gender discrimination in employment. The
Supreme People's Court issued a circular in December
2018 amending the Rules for Civil Causes of Action to
allow disputes over sexual harassment and employment
discrimination.\22\ This was followed in February 2019
by a joint circular outlining measures to promote
gender equality in employment, citing the need to
increase women's participation in the economy.\23\ The
measures primarily targeted gender discrimination in
job recruitment, outlining plans to develop procedures
for notification and mediation and to investigate and
penalize employers and recruitment agencies that fail
to comply.\24\ The circular also included legal
assistance for those bringing claims of gender-based
employment discrimination, job counseling and training
for women, and development of support for
childcare.\25\ In March 2019, Premier Li Keqiang also
announced support for addressing gender discrimination
in employment in his government work report.\26\
Assessments from rights advocates were mixed, from
critiquing the policy announcements for ``lack[ing]
detailed measures'' to seeing them as signs that
``gender discrimination is something that the
government can and is willing to manage.'' \27\
Local-level officials also took actions
related to gender discrimination. For example,
officials in Dezhou municipality, Shandong province,
established a reporting hotline,\28\ and Beijing
municipality officials published anti-sexual harassment
advertisements on all subway lines.\29\
Discriminatory laws and inadequate enforcement
persist. International observers \30\ reported that
gender-based employment discrimination in China has not
been checked by prohibitions against gender
discrimination in existing laws \31\ or by China's
international commitments.\32\ Chinese laws do not give
a clear definition of gender discrimination,\33\
leading to the refusal of courts and arbitration
committees to accept such cases.\34\ In addition, some
laws themselves continue to discriminate against women
by barring them from performing certain jobs--in some
cases based on whether they are menstruating, pregnant,
or breastfeeding.\35\
Domestic and Gender-Based Violence
Domestic violence continued to affect large numbers of
women in China. Based on a large-scale study published by the
People's Daily in November 2018, 30 percent of married women in
China have experienced some form of domestic violence.\36\
Nearly three years after the passage of the PRC Anti-Domestic
Violence Law \37\ in March 2016,\38\ Chinese courts had issued
a total of 3,718 protection orders by December 2018, approving
63 percent out of a total of 5,860 applications.\39\ News media
identified cultural norms that do not recognize domestic
violence as a crime as contributing to the low numbers of
reported incidents, with family members and police commonly
discouraging victims from going forward with requesting
protective orders or divorce--women who do report do so only
after experiencing an average of 35 incidents.\40\ As of August
2019, Yunnan province is the only province to have implemented
measures in accordance with the 2016 law, which includes a
mandatory reporting provision that makes government bodies
responsible for gathering evidence related to domestic
violence.\41\
Public Participation
Low levels of women's representation in
political leadership persisted. Although Chinese
domestic law contains pronouncements stressing the
importance of women's political participation,\42\ the
proportion of female representatives continued to fall
short of the 30 percent target recommended by the UN
Commission on the Status of Women.\43\ The Chinese
government is obligated under its international
commitments to ensure gender equality in political
participation.\44\
Blacklisting advocacy organizations and
activists working on gender equality issues. On January
8, 2019, the Guangzhou Municipal Department of Civil
Affairs in Guangdong province issued a list of
suspected ``illegal social organizations'' that
included the Guangzhou Gender and Sexuality Education
Center (Guangzhou Xingbie Jiaoyu Zhongxin), which
worked on both gender and LGBTQ issues, primarily
focusing on combating sexual harassment and
violence.\45\ Founded by prominent women's rights
advocate Wei Tingting,\46\ the organization had
encountered censorship restrictions for a campaign
raising funds to conduct a survey on the prevalence of
sexual harassment and assault on Chinese college
campuses, which it nonetheless conducted and published
in April 2018.\47\ The organization announced on the
social media platform WeChat in December 2018 that it
would temporarily cease operations.\48\ This followed a
wave of crackdowns on independent women's rights
advocacy in previous years that shut down leading
voices such as the social media accounts of prominent
independent media outlet Feminist Voices in March 2018
\49\ and the Beijing Zhongze Women's Legal Counseling
and Service Center in January 2016.\50\
Heavy censorship of content and symbols
related to feminist issues. As activists moved much of
their advocacy online in the face of growing
pressure,\51\ different social media campaigns in
support of victims of sexual assault engaged millions
before themselves being censored.\52\ According to Hong
Kong University researchers, reports of sexual
misconduct were ``one of the most heavily censored
topics on WeChat in 2018.'' \53\ A wide range of WeChat
public accounts that had circulated a petition in
support of a survivor of an alleged sexual assault were
shut down in April 2019.\54\
Despite official repression, independent
public advocacy for women's rights continued to
influence public discourse and policy. Public advocacy
in recent years has highlighted gender inequities in
recruitment \55\ and sexual harassment.\56\ In
addition, news media and civil society actors have
noted a connection to the issues publicly addressed by
national officials this year as a sign that independent
advocacy is having an impact even as it has been
severely suppressed.\57\

Human
Trafficking

Trafficking
Human Trafficking
Findings
In its 2019 Trafficking in Persons Report, the
U.S. State Department listed China as Tier III, which
is a designation for governments who ``do not fully
meet the minimum standards [under the Trafficking
Victims Protection Act] and are not making significant
efforts to do so.''
Chinese anti-trafficking law remains
inconsistent with international standards in the UN
Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in
Persons, Especially Women and Children (Palermo
Protocol), to which China is a State Party. Whereas the
Palermo Protocol encompasses the exploitation of any
individual, Chinese law addresses the selling of women
and children, making it difficult to assess the scale
of human trafficking in China as defined by
international standards.
Women and girls from countries including Burma
(Myanmar), Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, North Korea,
Pakistan, and Vietnam were trafficked into China for
forced marriage and sexual exploitation. The demand for
such trafficking is due in part to the sex ratio
imbalance in China, a result of decades of government-
imposed birth limits and a traditional preference for
sons, as well as a lack of economic opportunity in
countries of origin.
Chinese nationals were trafficked from China
to other parts of the world, including the United
States. Chinese sex workers were found working in
illicit massage parlors across the United States.
Because of their coercive nature, some of these cases
may constitute human trafficking.
Continued restrictions on movement imposed by
the hukou system contributed to the risks that internal
migrant workers face in human trafficking.
The Chinese government continued to subject
individuals to forced labor during pretrial detention
and in administrative detention.
Chinese authorities subjected Uyghur Muslim
and other ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous Region (XUAR) to forced labor in the
production of food, textiles, and other goods. German
scholar Adrian Zenz argues that cases of forced labor
in the XUAR are part of a large-scale government-
subsidized forced labor scheme. Supply chains of major
companies including Adidas AG, C&A Campbell Soup,
Esquel Group, Hennes & Mauritz AB, Kraft Heinz Co.,
Coca-Cola Co., and Gap Inc. may include products made
by such forced labor.
The government of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) reportedly continued to
generate revenue by sending DPRK nationals to work in
China under conditions that may constitute forced labor
and in possible violation of UN sanctions.
Hong Kong remained a destination for the
trafficking of migrant domestic workers from Indonesia
and the Philippines who face exploitative working
conditions. The Hong Kong government's refusal to
acknowledge the severity of the human trafficking
problem has resulted in weak policy responses in
addressing the issue.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Request the Department of Labor to use the latest
reporting to update their 2019 ``List of Goods Produced
by Child Labor or Forced Labor'' for China required by
the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act
of 2005, paying particular attention to including
products produced in or made with materials from the
XUAR, and removing products that may no longer be made
with forced labor.
Support the passage of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy
Act (H.R. 649/S. 178, 116th Cong., 1st Sess.) to
respond to Chinese treatment of Uyghur Muslims, such as
subjecting Uyghurs to forced labor and other human
rights violations in mass internment camps.
Support U.S. Government efforts to improve human
trafficking data collection. Work with regional
governments, multilateral institutions, and non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) to improve the
quality and accuracy of data and to monitor the
effectiveness of anti-trafficking measures. Urge the
Chinese government to collect and share relevant law
enforcement data related to human trafficking.
Incorporate language into bilateral and multilateral
economic agreements requiring member countries to
improve data collection on human trafficking and to
take concrete steps toward eliminating human
trafficking within their borders.
Discuss with Chinese officials in appropriate
bilateral and multilateral meetings the importance of
protecting worker rights as a means of combating human
trafficking for the purpose of forced labor. Stress
that when workers are able to organize and advocate for
their rights, they are less vulnerable to all forms of
exploitation, including forced labor.
Engage in regional cooperation to combat human
trafficking through multilateral agreements and forums
such as the Coordinated Mekong Ministerial Initiative
Against Trafficking, Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation,
and the East Asia Summit. Such regional cooperation
should address migration and the flow of refugees,
poverty, sex ratio imbalances, and other risk factors
that contribute to human trafficking.
Pursue cooperation on anti-trafficking efforts
through the U.S.-China Joint Liaison Group on Law
Enforcement Cooperation. Support the work of the U.S.
State Department's International Law Enforcement
Academy Program in Bangkok, Thailand, to build regional
law enforcement capacity.
Facilitate international exchanges among civil
society groups and industry associations to raise
awareness of best practices to identify and combat
human trafficking in supply chains. Support NGOs
working on anti-trafficking research, education,
prevention, and victims' services throughout Asia.

Defining Human Trafficking
As a State Party to the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress
and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and
Children (Palermo Protocol),\1\ China is obligated to enact
legislation criminalizing human trafficking as defined by the
Palermo Protocol.\2\ The definition of human trafficking under
the PRC Criminal Law,\3\ however, remains inconsistent with
Palermo Protocol standards.\4\ The Palermo Protocol definition
of human trafficking involves three components:
the action of recruiting, transporting,
harboring, or receiving persons;
the means of coercion, deception, or control;
\5\ and
``the purpose of exploitation,'' including
sexual exploitation or forced labor.\6\
In contrast, Chinese law focuses on the act of selling a woman
or child,\7\ rather than the purpose of exploitation.\8\ The
definition of trafficking in the PRC Criminal Law does not
clearly cover all forms of trafficking in the Palermo
Protocol,\9\ including certain types of non-physical coercion;
\10\ offenses against male victims; \11\ and forced labor,\12\
though forced labor is illegal under a separate provision of
the law.\13\ As defined by the Palermo Protocol, human
trafficking can but does not always involve crossing
international borders,\14\ such as in the examples of Chinese
government-sponsored forced labor described in this section. In
addition, the Chinese legal definition of trafficking includes
the purchase or abduction of children for subsequent sale
without specifying the purpose of these actions.\15\ Under the
Palermo Protocol, illegal adoptions constitute trafficking only
if the purpose is exploitation.\16\
Human trafficking experts note a dearth of reliable
statistics on the scale of human trafficking in Asia in
general; \17\ in China, inconsistencies between domestic law
and international standards further contribute to the
difficulty of assessing the scale of human trafficking.\18\
Trends and Developments
In 2019, the U.S. State Department listed China as Tier
III, a designation for governments who ``do not fully meet the
minimum standards [Under the Trafficking Victims Protection
Act] and are not making significant efforts to do so.'' \19\
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
CROSS-BORDER TRAFFICKING
China remains \20\ a destination country for human
trafficking, particularly of women and children from Southeast
Asia,\21\ and a source country for trafficking to the United
States, Europe, and Latin America.\22\ This past year, the
Commission observed regional and international news media
reports of the trafficking of women and girls to China for
forced marriage and sexual exploitation from Burma
(Myanmar),\23\ Cambodia,\24\ Indonesia,\25\ North Korea,\26\
Pakistan,\27\ and Vietnam; \28\ and the trafficking of
individuals to China from Burma, Nepal, and North Korea for the
purpose of forced labor.\29\
The commission further observed multiple reports of Chinese
nationals working in the U.S. sex industry \30\ through illicit
massage parlors.\31\ The managers of these illicit massage
parlors in some cases subjected women to poor living conditions
and restricted their freedom of movement.\32\ The coercive
nature of these cases may constitute human trafficking.\33\
In addition, in March 2019, a federal jury in New York
found Dan Zhong, a former Chinese diplomat to the United States
and former head of a U.S. affiliate of China Rilin Construction
Group, guilty of forced labor charges.\34\ Prosecutors alleged
that Dan Zhong and his former employer, Wang Landong, also a
former Chinese diplomat, forced Chinese construction workers to
work on construction for diplomatic and commercial
projects.\35\ The security deposits that the workers gave the
former diplomats to secure employment in the United States for
higher wages would be forfeited if the workers escaped.\36\
DOMESTIC TRAFFICKING
According to UN Action for Cooperation against Trafficking
in Persons (UN-ACT) and the U.S. Department of State, men,
women, and children were trafficked within China's borders for
forced labor, forced begging, and sexual exploitation.\37\
During this reporting year, the Commission observed cases of
trafficking for the purpose of forced labor, including one case
in Hunan province where traffickers abducted at least 10 men--
many with physical or intellectual disabilities--from several
provinces, and held them for years, forcing them to do various
physically demanding work and beating them for disobeying.\38\
Moreover, many of China's workers in construction and other
industries reportedly worked in conditions that may constitute
forced labor, facing frequent non-payment of wages.\39\ [For
more information on the problem of wage arrears, see Section
II--Worker Rights.]
GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED FORCED LABOR
This past year, the Chinese government continued \40\ to
subject individuals to forced labor during pretrial detention
and in administrative detention centers. The International
Labour Organization's (ILO) definition of forced labor makes an
exception for labor performed ``as a consequence of a
conviction in a court of law . . .,'' \41\ but the Commission
observed reports this past year of individuals in China
performing forced labor in detention before trial.\42\ The
Financial Times published an investigative report in August
2018 indicating that garlic peeled by unconvicted Chinese
detainees awaiting trial entered the United States.\43\ This is
in violation of U.S. law.\44\ Moreover, Chinese authorities
continued \45\ to require suspected drug users to perform labor
after detaining them in compulsory drug detoxification centers,
a form of administrative detention that bypasses the judicial
process.\46\ As the Chinese government does not convict
compulsory detoxification detainees in court, the requirement
to perform labor constitutes human trafficking under the
Palermo Protocol \47\ for the purpose of forced labor as
defined by the ILO.\48\ Compulsory drug detoxification centers
are similar to the reeducation through labor (RTL) system,\49\
under which detainees were subjected to forced labor \50\
without judicial process.\51\ After abolishing RTL in 2013,\52\
authorities reportedly converted most RTL facilities to
compulsory drug detoxification centers.\53\
Authorities continued \54\ to detain sex workers accused of
prostitution for up to two years without judicial process and
require them to perform labor in a form of administrative
detention known as ``custody and education'' (shourong
jiaoyu).\55\ In March 2019, one member of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference renewed his call to abolish
the practice of ``custody and education,'' \56\ and a U.S.-
based human rights expert observed that while the intention of
``custody and education'' may be to educate those detained, in
reality ``the system puts people into forced labor.'' \57\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Forced Labor in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
This past year, authorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region
(XUAR) expanded a system of extrajudicial mass internment camps.\58\
German scholar Adrian Zenz estimated that ``up to 1.5 million ethnic
minorities . . . are or have been interned.'' \59\ Satellite imagery,
personal testimonies, and official documents indicate that the XUAR
authorities required current and former detainees of these mass
internment camps to perform forced labor in factories inside or near
the camps.\60\ International media reported that the XUAR authorities
have forced detainees to work in food, textile, and other manufacturing
jobs,\61\ and in some cases in government subsidized factories after
authorities release them from the camps.\62\ Some observers have
compared work in mass internment camps to previous forced labor
practices including the now abolished reeducation through labor (RTL)
system.\63\ [For more information on mass internment camps, see Section
IV--Xinjiang.]
In mid-December 2018, international media reported that Badger
Sportswear,\64\ an American sportswear company, received shipments from
Hetian Taida Apparel Co. Ltd. that included clothing made by forced
labor.\65\ Soon after the reports were released, Badger Sportswear
ended its relationship with Hetian Taida.\66\ Hetian Taida, based in
the XUAR, had a cluster of 10 workshops within a mass internment
camp.\67\ Its workshops were featured in a 15-minute government
broadcasted video report that highlighted ``a vocational skills
education and training center'' in Hotan (Hetian) city, Hotan
prefecture, XUAR.\68\ The chairman of Hetian Taida, Wu Hongbo,
confirmed that the company had a factory inside the camp, saying that
Hetian Taida provided employment to trainees who were deemed
unproblematic by the government as part of their ``contribution to
eradicating poverty.'' \69\
In May 2019, the Wall Street Journal linked supply chains of Adidas
AG, C&A Campbell Soup, Esquel Group,\70\ Hennes & Mauritz AB, Kraft
Heinz Co., Coca-Cola Co., and Gap Inc. to forced labor in the XUAR.\71\
Additionally, according to a July 2019 report by ABC Australia, many
Australian companies source cotton from the XUAR.\72\ German scholar
Adrian Zenz argued that forced labor in the XUAR is part of a large
government-subsidized forced labor scheme that affects current and
former detainees of mass internment camps in the XUAR as well as
individuals not held in the camps.\73\ Zenz warned that ``[s]oon, many
or most products made in China that rely at least in part on low-
skilled, labor-intensive manufacturing, could contain elements of
involuntary ethnic minority labor from Xinjiang.'' \74\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Risk Factors
This past year, Chinese workers migrating within China were
at risk of human trafficking, and government restrictions on
freedom of residence and movement and worker rights exacerbated
this risk. Although the central government promoted hukou
system reforms to move millions of rural Chinese to cities, the
hukou system continued to disadvantage and marginalize internal
migrants.\75\ Migrant workers have limited access to housing
and government benefits due to the lack of official status in
their new places of residence,\76\ and they are more likely to
work in informal employment sectors.\77\ The hukou system
reportedly exacerbates these migrants' vulnerability to
trafficking for the purpose of forced labor.\78\ [For more
information on the marginalization of internal migrants in
China, see Section II--Special Topic: Migrant Neighborhoods a
Target of Anti-Crime and Vice Campaign.]
The Chinese government also limited workers' freedom of
association by not permitting the formation of independent
unions.\79\ A September 2016 UN report noted that the failure
to enforce workers' fundamental right to freedom of association
``directly contributes'' to human trafficking.\80\ Observers
have noted that informal labor contracting practices in China
increase the vulnerability to human trafficking of Chinese
workers involved in Chinese infrastructure projects at home and
abroad, including China's Belt and Road Initiative.\81\ [For
more information on restrictions on worker rights in China, see
Section II--Worker Rights.]
Decades of government-imposed birth limits combined with a
traditional preference for sons have led to a sex ratio
imbalance in China.\82\ In rural areas, this imbalance is more
pronounced as many women have migrated to cities for work.\83\
The sex ratio imbalance has created a demand for marriageable
women that may contribute to human trafficking for forced
marriage.\84\ [For more information on China's population
policies, see Section II--Population Control.]
In addition to domestic human trafficking, individuals from
other Asian countries are at risk for human trafficking in
China.\85\ A lack of economic opportunity in developing
countries in Asia, especially among ethnic minority
communities,\86\ contributes to human trafficking from that
region.\87\ Women and girls in these countries are particularly
at risk of trafficking for the purpose of forced marriage.\88\
The Chinese government continued to treat refugees from the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) as illegal
economic migrants and maintained a policy of repatriating
undocumented North Koreans,\89\ leaving the refugees, who are
predominantly women, vulnerable to trafficking for forced
marriage \90\ and sexual exploitation.\91\ [For more
information, see Section II--North Korean Refugees in China.]
While reports from March 2019 indicated that many workers
from the DPRK had been repatriated due to the Chinese
government's enforcement of UN sanctions,\92\ the DPRK
government reportedly continued \93\ to generate revenue by
sending DPRK nationals to work in China under conditions that
may constitute forced labor.\94\ The DPRK government reportedly
withheld approximately 67 percent of the workers' earnings.\95\
Anti-Trafficking Efforts
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year, government
figures indicated a decline in the number of criminal human
trafficking cases opened by public security officials.
According to the 2018 China Law Yearbook, public security
officials opened 6,668 criminal cases involving the trafficking
of women and children in 2017.\96\ This was 6 percent fewer
cases than the 7,121 cases opened in 2016.\97\ The National
Bureau of Statistics of China further reported that in 2017,
authorities uncovered 546 cases of child trafficking,\98\ down
from 618 cases in 2016.\99\ All figures likely include cases of
illegal adoption,\100\ while excluding other cases such as
offenses against male victims \101\ and forced labor.\102\ In
June 2019, the Ministry of Public Security reported it rescued
over one thousand trafficking victims from July to December
2018 in coordination with five Southeast Asian countries.\103\
Hong Kong
Hong Kong remained a destination for human
trafficking,\104\ with migrant domestic workers (MDWs)
particularly at risk of exploitation for forced labor. The Hong
Kong Census and Statistics Department's 2018 annual digest
reported that in 2017, there were over 360,000 MDWs working for
households in Hong Kong, the majority (approximately 97
percent) of whom came from the Philippines and Indonesia.\105\
Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), advocates, and MDWs
themselves reported that MDWs continued to face exploitative
working conditions, including inadequate living conditions,
little time off, unpaid wages, and in some cases physical and
emotional abuse.\106\ Two regulations--one requiring MDWs to
live with their employers (live-in rule) \107\ and another
requiring them to leave Hong Kong within two weeks of contract
termination \108\--contribute to MDWs' risk of exploitation for
forced labor.\109\
The definition of human trafficking in Hong Kong's Crimes
Ordinance covers only the cross-border movement of persons
``for the purpose of prostitution'' and not other forms of
trafficking such as forced labor or trafficking that occurs
within Hong Kong.\110\ A 2018 Court of Appeal ruled in favor of
the Hong Kong government when the government appealed a 2016
ruling, saying the Hong Kong government is not ``[obligated
under the Hong Kong Bill of Rights] to enact specific
legislation to combat forced labour.'' \111\ In March 2019
Matthew Cheung, Chief Secretary for Administration of the Hong
Kong government, listed various measures Hong Kong was taking
to combat trafficking and said it is ``unfair and groundless
for some critics to accuse the government of lacking the
determination in tackling people trafficking simply because
there is no composite law here.'' \112\ But critics said there
was no one single law against trafficking and existing laws do
not cover all forms of trafficking present in Hong Kong.\113\
While China acceded to the Palermo Protocol in 2010, the
central government has not extended the Protocol to apply to
Hong Kong.\114\

North Korean Refugees in China
Findings
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year,
the Chinese government continued to detain North Korean
refugees in China and repatriate them to the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), where they face
severe punishments, including torture, imprisonment,
forced labor, and even execution. The repatriation of
North Korean refugees violates China's obligations
under international human rights and refugee law and
may amount to ``aiding and abetting crimes against
humanity.''
The majority of North Korean refugees escape
to South Korea via China and Southeast Asian countries.
This past year, Chinese and North Korean authorities
reportedly imposed stricter border controls to deter
North Korean refugees from escaping the DPRK. The South
Korean government reported that about 1,137 North
Korean refugees escaped to South Korea in 2018,
compared to the peak of 2,914 refugees in 2009.
South Korean missionaries and organizations
have played a crucial role in assisting and
facilitating the movement of North Korean refugees in
China. Chinese authorities' crackdown on and expulsions
of South Korean missionaries in recent years have
undermined refugee rescue work carried out by the
missionaries.
The majority of North Korean refugees leaving
the DPRK are women. The Chinese government's refusal to
recognize these women as refugees denies them legal
protection and may encourage the trafficking of North
Korean women and girls within China. The UK-based Korea
Future Initiative estimated that about 60 percent of
all female North Korean refugees in China are
trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
Many children born to Chinese fathers and
North Korean mothers remain deprived of basic rights to
education and other public services, owing to their
lack of legal resident status in China, which
constitutes violations of China's PRC Nationality Law
and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Urge the Chinese government to recognize North
Koreans in China as refugees, especially as refugees
sur place who fear persecution upon return to their
country of origin, regardless of their reason for
leaving the DPRK; immediately halt the repatriation of
North Korean refugees; adopt asylum or refugee
legislation and incorporate the principle of non-
refoulement into domestic legislation; establish a
responsible government institution and mechanism to
determine asylee or refugee status for North Koreans
seeking international protection in China, in
cooperation with the UN High Commissioner for Refugees;
and allow North Korean refugees safe passage to another
country, including to the Republic of Korea.
Consider using the suite of sanctions that are
available, where appropriate, against Chinese
government agencies and individuals involved in the
repatriation of North Korean refugees; and press for
increased international monitoring of and
accountability for the Chinese government's treatment
of refugees.
Urge Chinese authorities to recognize the legal
status of North Korean women who marry or have children
with Chinese citizens, and ensure that all such
children are granted resident status and access to
education and other public services in accordance with
Chinese law and international standards.
Appoint and confirm the U.S. Special Envoy on North
Korean Human Rights Issues, and encourage the Special
Envoy to work with South Korean counterparts to
coordinate efforts related to humanitarian assistance
and human rights promotion for North Korean refugees in
China, in accordance with the North Korean Human Rights
Reauthorization Act (Public Law No. 115-198).

Introduction
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year, the Chinese
government's policy to detain North Korean refugees and
repatriate them to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) remained in place, despite substantial evidence that
repatriated persons face torture, imprisonment, forced labor,
execution, and other inhuman treatment.\1\ The North Korean
government's imprisonment and torture of repatriated North
Koreans render North Koreans in China refugees sur place who
fear persecution upon return to their country of origin,
regardless of their reason for leaving the DPRK.\2\ The Chinese
government, however, regards North Korean refugees in China as
illegal economic migrants \3\ and maintains a policy of
forcible repatriation based on a 1998 border protocol with the
DPRK.\4\ China's repatriation of North Korean refugees
contravenes its international obligations under the 1951 UN
Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967
Protocol, to which China has acceded.\5\ China is also
obligated under the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel,
Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment to refrain from
repatriating persons if there are ``substantial grounds for
believing that [they] would be in danger of being subjected to
torture.'' \6\
Border Conditions and Repatriation of Refugees
The majority of North Korean refugees escape to South Korea
via China and Southeast Asian countries,\7\ and heightened
security measures along the China-North Korea border may have
contributed to a trend of significant decline in the number of
North Korean refugees that reach South Korea.\8\ This past
year, Chinese and North Korean authorities reportedly imposed
stricter border controls to deter North Korean refugees from
escaping the DPRK.\9\ Chinese authorities also appear to be
conducting regular raids on safe houses and detaining higher
numbers of North Korean refugees than in the past.\10\ Reuters
reported in June 2019 that Chinese authorities detained ``at
least 30'' North Koreans in China since mid-April.\11\ A rights
advocate, however, separately estimated 20 to 30 detentions and
as many as 7 raids every month.\12\ The South Korean Ministry
of Unification reported that about 1,137 North Korean refugees
reached South Korea in 2018, compared to the peak of 2,914
refugees in 2009.\13\
Throughout the 2019 reporting year, Chinese authorities
reportedly detained and repatriated North Korean refugees to
the DPRK. Representative cases included the following:
November 2018. Chinese authorities reportedly
detained two North Korean refugees in Dandong
municipality, Liaoning province, and repatriated them
to the DPRK.\14\ In a separate incident, Chinese
authorities detained another North Korean refugee at an
unknown location near the China-North Korea border and
later repatriated the refugee.\15\
According to a December 2018 Daily NK report,
Chinese authorities repatriated an elderly North Korean
refugee after he had been involved in a traffic
accident at an unknown location in China.\16\ The
refugee reportedly died a week after his repatriation
to the DPRK, due to a lack of medical treatment.\17\
February 2019. China's Ministry of State
Security officials reportedly detained a North Korean
refugee family of three in Shenyang municipality,
Liaoning.\18\ The Daily NK warned that if repatriated,
the family could face severe punishment, because they
escaped North Korea during ``a very politically
sensitive time.'' \19\
April 2019. According to South Korean media
reports, in early April, Vietnamese authorities
reportedly detained three North Korean refugees near
the China-Vietnam border and later transferred them to
Chinese authorities.\20\ In late April, Chinese
authorities detained a group of seven North Korean
refugees--including a minor and her uncle--at an
unknown location in Shenyang, causing concerns that
they too may be repatriated.\21\
May 2019. The Daily NK reported the detentions
of 14 North Korean defectors in China: on May 15, two
detentions in Shenyang; on May 21, four detentions
(including two teenagers) in Nanning municipality,
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, two more detentions
in Shenyang, and two detentions in Tonghua
municipality, Jilin province; and on May 25, four more
detentions in Shenyang.\22\
July 2019. Radio Free Asia cited South Korean
sources who claimed that Chinese authorities detained
60 North Koreans and had already begun repatriating
some of them to the DPRK.\23\
As of August 2019, the Commission had not observed any new
developments in these cases.
In 2014, the UN Commission of Inquiry on Human Rights in
the Democratic People's Republic of Korea stated that China's
forcible repatriation of North Korean refugees may amount to
``aiding and abetting crimes against humanity.'' \24\ During
this reporting year, UN officials again voiced their concerns
and urged Chinese authorities on a number of occasions to stop
the repatriation of North Korean refugees.\25\
Crackdown on Foreign Missionaries
During this reporting year, the Commission continued to
observe reports of Chinese authorities cracking down on
organizations and individuals, particularly South Korean
Christian missionaries and churches, that have played a crucial
role in assisting and facilitating the movement of North Korean
refugees outside the DPRK.\26\ As documented in the
Commission's 2017 and 2018 annual reports, in recent years
Chinese authorities expelled at least several hundred South
Korean missionaries, many of whom assisted North Korean
refugees in fleeing to South Korea and other countries.\27\ One
international advocacy group stated that the recent wave of
expulsions of foreign missionaries is one of the largest since
1954, a development that has undermined refugee rescue work
carried out by the missionaries.\28\
Trafficking of North Korean Women
North Korean women who enter China illegally remain
particularly vulnerable to human trafficking. The demand for
North Korean women has been linked to a sex ratio imbalance in
China exacerbated by the Chinese government's population
planning policies.\29\ Sources indicate that the majority of
North Korean refugees leaving the DPRK are women,\30\ many of
whom are trafficked by force or deception from the DPRK into or
within China for the purposes of forced marriage and commercial
sexual exploitation.\31\
The Chinese government's refusal to recognize these women
as refugees denies them legal protection and may encourage the
trafficking of North Korean women and girls within China.\32\
According to a May 2019 report published by U.K.-based Korea
Future Initiative, an estimated 60 percent of all female North
Korean refugees in China are trafficked for the purpose of
sexual exploitation.\33\ Roughly 50 percent of those trafficked
women ``are forced into prostitution'' and 15 percent are
``pressed into cybersex.'' \34\ This past year, international
news media reported several cases of traffickers confining
North Korean women and girls at unknown locations in China and
forcing them to work in ``cybersex dens.'' \35\ China is
obligated to take measures to safeguard trafficking victims and
suppress all forms of trafficking of women under the Convention
on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women
and the UN Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking
in Persons, Especially Women and Children.\36\ [For more
information on the sex ratio imbalance and the trafficking of
women in China, see Section II--Population Control and Section
II--Human Trafficking.]
Children of North Korean and Chinese Parents
Many children born to Chinese fathers and North Korean
mothers remain deprived of basic rights to education and other
public services, owing to their lack of legal resident status
in China. According to some estimates, the population of
children born in China to North Korean women ranges between
20,000 and 30,000.\37\ The PRC Nationality Law provides that
all children born in China are entitled to Chinese nationality
if either parent is a Chinese citizen.\38\ Chinese authorities
reportedly continue to largely deprive these children of their
rights to birth registration and nationality.\39\ Without proof
of resident status, these children are unable to access
education and other public services.\40\ The denial of
nationality rights and access to education for these children
contravenes China's obligations under the Convention on the
Rights of the Child.\41\

Public Health
Public Health
Public Health
Findings
Food safety and vaccine safety scandals have
continued to emerge this past year, despite the Chinese
government's attempts in the past decade to improve
quality control. Analysts point to a lack of
accountability, weak regulatory capacity and
enforcement of laws, corruption, and government
procurement systems that favor low-cost goods. The
National People's Congress passed a new vaccine law in
June 2019 aimed at strengthening vaccine supervision,
penalizing producers of substandard or fake vaccines,
and introducing compensation for victims of faulty
vaccines.
Despite strong regulations aimed at improving
food and vaccine safety and punishments for companies
and individuals found guilty of criminal acts,
authorities also continued to detain citizens for
speaking out and organizing protests in response to
food and vaccine scandals.
Chinese authorities reportedly continued to
forcibly commit individuals to psychiatric facilities,
including government critics and those with grievances
against government officials and legal processes, even
though the PRC Mental Health Law prohibits forcible
commitment as a form of punishment.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Continue to support technical assistance and exchange
programs in public health. Require that U.S.-China
cooperative programs include the participation of U.S.
and Chinese non-governmental organizations and a focus
on human rights.
Urge Chinese officials--including officials in the
National Health Commission--to focus on effective
implementation of laws and regulations that prohibit
health-based discrimination in employment and
education. Where appropriate, share the United States'
ongoing experience promoting the rights of persons with
disabilities in education and employment, through non-
governmental advocacy and services, as well as legal
and regulatory means.
Urge the Chinese government to establish panels of
legal, medical, social work, and security professionals
from within and outside the government to monitor and
report on implementation of the PRC Mental Health Law
(MHL) and initiatives under the National Mental Health
Work Plan (2015-2020) to ensure that local
implementation consistently meets standards of care and
rights protection stipulated in the MHL, the PRC Law on
the Protection of the Rights of Persons with
Disabilities, and international standards.

Legislative and Policy Developments
In October 2018, the National People's Congress Standing
Committee released a second draft of healthcare legislation
aimed at protecting healthcare workers from the ongoing problem
of ``commotions at hospitals'' (yi'nao).\1\ The draft
legislation establishes that actions such as disturbing order
at healthcare institutions, threatening or endangering the
personal safety of staff, and illegally gaining favors will be
investigated as crimes.\2\ In February 2019, the Chinese
Communist Party General Office and State Council General Office
issued the ``Provisions on the Food Safety Responsibility
System for Local Party and Government Leading Cadres,'' which,
if implemented, could strengthen food safety accountability for
local officials.\3\ In June 2019, the National People's
Congress passed the PRC Vaccine Management Law set to take
effect in December 2019.\4\
Food Safety
Although the Chinese government has committed itself to
protect citizens' right to safe food,\5\ and it continues to
take steps aimed at improving food safety,\6\ food safety
scandals nevertheless continued to occur.\7\ Authorities
suppressed protests by victims and their parents,\8\ violating
freedoms of expression, assembly, and demonstration.\9\
The Commission observed reports of the following instances
of such suppression during its 2019 reporting year:
In September 2018, after expired, worm-
infested food was served to children at three
kindergartens, authorities detained two individuals in
Wuhu municipality, Anhui province, who were believed to
be responsible.\10\ The incident reportedly affected
765 children.\11\
According to international and domestic
reports, in March 2019 public security authorities in
Chengdu municipality, Sichuan province, used pepper
spray to control parents who protested against
unsanitary food served at a private high school and
detained at least 12 of them.\12\ At least 77 students
received medical attention after ingesting the food,
including 3 who were hospitalized.\13\
Drug Safety
Vaccine scandals continued this reporting year,\14\
sparking protests by parents of sickened children.\15\ In the
aftermath of a major vaccine scandal uncovered in 2018
involving Changsheng Biotechnology Company in Changchun
municipality, Jilin province,\16\ public health expert Yanzhong
Huang noted that the case had exposed ``systematic safety risks
across China's entire vaccine industry.'' \17\ Huang further
said that ongoing scandals stem from ``a host of issues
confronting China today: corruption, moral decline, loopholes
in internal corporate controls, weak regulatory capacity, and a
lack of accountability.'' \18\
The Office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights and
the World Health Organization, in a jointly issued fact sheet,
noted that the right to quality healthcare includes
``scientifically approved and unexpired drugs.'' \19\ Following
the 2018 vaccine scandal involving Changsheng Biotechnology
Company,\20\ in June 2019 the National People's Congress
Standing Committee passed the PRC Vaccine Management Law, aimed
at strengthening supervision, penalizing producers and
distributors of substandard or fake vaccines, and introducing
compensation for victims of faulty vaccines.\21\
During this past year, the Chinese government took the
following actions against companies and individuals deemed
responsible for vaccine safety violations:
In October 2018, the National Medical Products
Administration imposed a record total penalty of 9.1
billion yuan (approximately US$1.3 billion) on
Changsheng Biotechnology Company, which it found
responsible for producing faulty vaccines that were
administered to hundreds of thousands of people, along
with other illegal actions, and detained 18 people.\22\
In November 2018, the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock
exchanges issued new measures providing for the
mandatory delisting of companies suspected of ``illegal
behavior in the areas of national security, public
security, environmental security, work safety, and
public health.'' \23\ In January 2019, the state media
outlet Xinhua reported that Changsheng Biotechnology
announced that it had received its delisting notice
from the Shenzhen Stock Exchange.\24\
In January 2019, authorities in Jinhu county,
Jiangsu province, reportedly fired 3 health officials
and ``held 33 persons responsible'' after at least 145
children were administered expired polio vaccines.\25\
In January 2019, authorities in Shijiazhuang
municipality, Hebei province, criminally detained a
nurse suspected of administering incorrect vaccines to
29 children for financial gain, and removed 2 district
heads of the Shijiazhuang disease control center.\26\
In April 2019, authorities in Hainan province
fined and revoked the license of privately-owned Bo'ao
Yinfeng Healthcare International Hospital, for
reportedly administering fake HPV vaccines to at least
38 patients, one of whom reportedly was pregnant.\27\
The Commission observed that Chinese authorities violated
the rights to free speech and free assembly of individuals who
protested against unsafe vaccines and sought compensation,
including the following: \28\
In February 2019, authorities in Beijing
municipality detained He Fangmei, whose daughter was
paralyzed in March 2018 by a series of tainted
vaccines,\29\ after He Fangmei organized other
aggrieved parents to protest before the annual meetings
of the National People's Congress and Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (Two Sessions).\30\
In April 2019, authorities charged her with ``picking
quarrels and provoking trouble,'' and held her at the
Xinxiang Public Security Bureau Detention Center in
Xinxiang municipality, Henan province.\31\ He's case
was sent to court in August 2019.\32\
On or around September 2, 2018, authorities in
Beijing detained Tan Hua, in connection to her public
advocacy for compensation for victims of tainted
vaccines in August 2018, and reportedly transferred her
to the custody of authorities in Shanghai
municipality.\33\
Ongoing Misuse of the PRC Mental Health Law
Authorities continued to use forcible psychiatric
commitment (bei jingshenbing), in violation of the PRC Mental
Health Law, to punish or arbitrarily detain individuals who
expressed political dissent or grievances against the
government.\34\ Two experts in Chinese law commented that the
law's definition of ``mental disorder'' is too vague, and a
``lack of due process in such important decision-making
jeopardizes millions of people's basic right to freedom from
arbitrary detention.'' \35\
Examples of misuse of the law this past year include the
following:
On July 16, 2018, officials in Zhuzhou
municipality, Hunan province, forcibly committed Dong
Yaoqiong, a 29-year-old woman who live-streamed a video
of herself criticizing Communist Party General
Secretary Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party,
to a psychiatric hospital.\36\ According to Radio Free
Asia, authorities detained her father in August
2018,\37\ and barred a rights lawyer from visiting
her.\38\ The Commission has not observed updates on the
status of Dong Yaoqiong during this reporting year.\39\
In March 2019, authorities in Shanghai
municipality forcibly committed Yan Fenlan to a
psychiatric institution after she had traveled to
Beijing during the Two Sessions to petition for
compensation for her demolished home.\40\ She was first
forcibly committed to a psychiatric institution in 2008
after she petitioned authorities in Beijing and
Shanghai regarding land confiscation.\41\

The Environment
Findings
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year,
top Chinese Communist Party and government leaders
continued to highlight the importance of protecting the
environment, yet environmental pollution remained a
major challenge. The government's vision of top-down
environmental governance was demonstrated by the
National Development and Reform Commission's work
report for 2018 which stated, ``the government leads,
enterprises are the main actors, and social
organizations and the public participate.'' In
addition, the government severely limited the role of
the public in environmental protection.
In March 2019, Minister of Ecology and
Environment Li Ganjie reported that ``some local
governments were not containing pollution until clean-
up deadlines approached or national inspection teams
arrived.'' Li noted that these local governments
imposed blanket production bans on businesses
regardless of their environmental performance, thereby
damaging the credibility of the government and the
rights of law-abiding enterprises. In 2018, Chinese
authorities approved the arrest of 15,095 people for
environmental crimes, an increase of over 50 percent
from 2017.
The government continued to report progress in
environmental protection, although a March 2019 ranking
of air pollution in over 3,000 cities around the world,
compiled by IQAir in collaboration with Greenpeace East
Asia, indicated that 57 of the 100 most polluted cities
in 2018 (based on fine particulate concentrations) were
in China. Although some non-governmental organizations
have standing as plaintiffs in certain public interest
lawsuits, most public interest litigation continued to
be brought by the government.
During this reporting year, Chinese and
international media reported on incidents in which
officials lied about environmental problems, failed to
take meaningful action despite repeated environmental
violations, or were involved in environmental
corruption, resulting in some cases of disciplinary
action against local officials. In March 2019, an
explosion at Jiangsu Tianjiayi Chemical plant--a
facility that had been penalized six different times in
the previous two years for environmental and safety
violations--killed 78 people, injured over 600, and
forced the evacuation of almost 3,000. Authorities
responded by closing down all chemical facilities in
the area.
Chinese citizens continued to raise concerns
about health issues related to the environment through
street-level protests and other forms of public
advocacy. Chinese authorities detained Lu Guang, an
American permanent resident and photojournalist who is
known for his photographs documenting environmental
degradation and coal mining, while he was in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in November 2018.
In 2018, carbon dioxide emissions in China
continued to increase, as Chinese government-backed
financial institutions funded international coal-fired
power projects, raising international concerns about
air pollution and increasing carbon dioxide emissions.
The government promoted the use of traditional
Chinese medicine in countries participating in the Belt
and Road Initiative, raising international concerns
about wildlife trafficking and the sale of products
made from tigers and rhinos.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Call on the Chinese government to cease harassment of
environmental advocates and follow international
standards on freedom of speech, association, and
assembly, including those contained in the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights,
the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and China's
Constitution.
In meetings with Chinese officials, raise the
detentions of photojournalist Lu Guang; Tibetan village
head Karma; founder Xue Renyi and worker Pan Bin of
Chongqing municipality-based Green Leaf Action;
environmental advocates Chen Wuquan, Chen Weiliang,
Chen Zhenming, Chen Huansen, Chen Chunlin, Chen Shuai,
and Chen Longqun; and the Mongolian herders O.
Sechenbaatar and Tsojgil.
Support efforts by Chinese and U.S. groups working to
use satellite analysis and remote sensing to monitor
environmental problems in China, and also expand
awareness of citizens' environmental rights in China
and the protection of those rights.
Encourage Chinese leaders to strengthen the rule of
law and transparency in the environmental and climate
sectors. Raise questions with Chinese officials about
the manipulation of environmental data and censorship
of environmental news reporting, as well as the
detention of the former head of the National Energy
Administration, Nur Bekri.

During the Commission's 2019 reporting year, top Chinese
Communist Party and government leaders continued to highlight
the importance of protecting the environment, yet environmental
pollution remained a major challenge in China due to
authorities' top-down approach to environmental problems,
transparency shortcomings, and the suppression and detention of
environmental advocates. The central government was focused on
addressing local level officials' shortcomings in protecting
the environment.\1\ Central authorities heavily controlled
media and permitted space for reporting only to the extent
consistent with central government policies,\2\ such as pushing
local officials to enforce its environmental policies.\3\ This
reporting year, carbon dioxide emissions in China continued to
increase,\4\ as Chinese government-backed financial
institutions funded international coal-fired power projects,
raising international concerns about air pollution and
increasing carbon dioxide emissions.\5\
The Chinese government's vision of top-down environmental
governance was demonstrated by the National Development and
Reform Commission's work report for 2018 which stated, ``the
government leads, enterprises are the main actors, and social
organizations and the public participate.'' \6\ In the recently
enacted PRC Soil Pollution Prevention and Control Law,\7\ for
example, the term ``public participation'' refers only to the
requirement that the public must follow official policies.\8\
The law lacks any provision for public supervision, as noted by
Greenpeace East Asia and Nanjing University Ecology department,
who concluded that although ``the new law does take an
important step towards openness . . ., [p]ublic supervision
still has no place in the regulatory system.'' \9\ In December
2018, the UN special procedure mandate holders issued a
statement on climate change calling on State Parties to
``ensure full and effective participation, access to
information and transparency . . . in the public spaces where
actors from civil society can gather and exercise their rights
to freedom of expression and opinion, association and peaceful
assembly.'' \10\
Not only did Chinese authorities fail to promote meaningful
public participation, they actively suppressed those who
monitor environmental issues. Chinese authorities detained Lu
Guang--an American permanent resident and photojournalist \11\
who is known for his photographs documenting environmental
degradation and coal mining \12\--while he was in the Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) in November 2018.\13\ According
to the Committee to Protect Journalists, ``Lu's detention is a
high-profile illustration of the cruel and arbitrary way that
China detains journalists and other civilians in [the XUAR].''
\14\
Environmental Enforcement and Persistence of Severe Pollution
During this reporting year, severe pollution persisted in
China, and Chinese authorities criticized some local officials
for failing to enforce environmental regulations. In March
2019, Minister of Ecology and Environment Li Ganjie reported
that ``some local governments were not containing pollution
until clean-up deadlines approached or national inspection
teams arrived.'' \15\ Li noted that these local governments
imposed blanket production bans on businesses regardless of
their environmental performance, thereby damaging the
credibility of the government and the rights of law-abiding
enterprises.\16\ In constrast, other local governments ``might
have loosened supervision on air pollution and carbon
emissions'' due to the current economic downturn, according to
a China-based adviser to an international environmental non-
governmental organization.\17\ While the government continued
to report progress in environmental protection,\18\ a March
2019 ranking of air pollution in over 3,000 cities around the
world, compiled by IQAir in collaboration with Greenpeace East
Asia,\19\ indicated that 57 of the 100 most polluted cities in
2018 (based on fine particulate concentration) were in
China.\20\ According to a Hong Kong-based professor, ``air
pollution [has much] to do with burning of fossil fuel . . .;
so by addressing the air pollution sources, you actually can
address these CO2 emissions.'' \21\
Public Interest Litigation and Criminal Enforcement
During the 2019 reporting year, the Chinese government
played a dominant role in public interest environmental
litigation, and criminal environmental enforcement
significantly increased. In 2018, Chinese courts accepted 1,737
public interest environmental lawsuits filed by procuratorates,
compared to 65 that were filed by non-governmental
organizations (NGOs).\22\ Although some NGOs have standing as
plaintiffs in certain public interest lawsuits, most public
interest litigation continued to be brought by the
government.\23\ In a significant development, in a public
interest case brought by the NGOs China Biodiversity
Conservation and Green Development Fund and Friends of Nature
in December 2018, the Jiangsu High People's Court rejected
claims that three chemical companies pay for soil remediation
near a school.\24\ The court, however, held that the NGOs were
not responsible for court fees assessed by the lower court--an
issue that had been a significant concern to Chinese NGOs.\25\
In 2018, Chinese authorities increased criminal enforcement, as
authorities indicted 42,195 people and approved the arrest of
15,095 people for environmental crimes, a 51.5 percent increase
in arrests from 2017.\26\
Suppression of Environmental Protests and Advocates
Chinese citizens continued to raise concerns about health
issues related to the environment through street-level protests
and other forms of public advocacy at the risk of being
persecuted, such as by imprisonment. China's Constitution \27\
provides for freedom of speech, assembly, association, and
demonstration, as do the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights,\28\ the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights,\29\ and the UN Human Rights Council Framework on Human
Rights and the Environment.\30\ The following cases not only
illustrate common types of environmental complaints raised by
Chinese citizens but also reveal the ongoing lack of protection
for citizens' rights when they raise environmental concerns:
Hazardous Waste Processing in Guangdong
province. In October 2018, thousands of residents in
Shunde district, Foshan municipality, Guangdong,
protested government plans to build an industrial waste
processing facility near local drinking water sources
and fish farms.\31\ Residents reported that the
government had not provided adequate public
consultation on the project, had criticized residents
who joined the protests for disturbing social order,
and had deleted thousands of social media posts about
the planned project.\32\
Environmental group in Chongqing municipality.
In December 2018, authorities at a closed trial
sentenced Pan Bin, a member of Green Leaf Action, to
four years in prison for ``picking quarrels and
provoking trouble.'' \33\ In May 2018, authorities had
detained Xue Renyi, the founder of Green Leaf Action,
and, as of May 2019, he remained in detention.\34\
Green Leaf Action advocates for environmental
protection, and in 2016, police had warned Xue that the
group was being ``controlled'' by ``foreign forces.''
\35\
Land Reclamation in Guangdong. In January
2019, the Zhanjiang Economic and Technological
Development Zone People's Court in Guangdong sentenced
environmental advocates Chen Wuquan (a disbarred rights
lawyer), Chen Weiliang, Chen Zhenming, Chen Huansen,
Chen Chunlin, Chen Shuai, and Chen Longqun to prison
terms ranging from one to five years in prison for
``picking quarrels and provoking trouble.'' \36\
Beginning in October 2017, these individuals and other
villagers from Diaoluo village, Donghai Island,
Zhanjiang, protested a land reclamation project that
they claimed was illegal and had destroyed the natural
environment.\37\ In February 2019, the Council of Bars
and Law Societies of Europe, an organization that
represents over one million lawyers in 45 European
countries, criticized the detention and sentencing of
Chen Wuquan as being ``solely motivated by his activity
as a lawyer'' and expressed concern about possible
violations of the UN Basic Principles on the Role of
Lawyers.\38\
Mining in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR).
Radio Free Asia reported that in March 2019, Chinese
authorities had forcibly relocated a group of
approximately 12 families in Gonjo (Gongjue) county,
Qamdo (Changdu) municipality, TAR, from their rural
homes to a newly built urban area.\39\ Authorities
reportedly moved the families for mining-related
development, and the villagers were only the most
recent group of Tibetans from nine villages
affected.\40\ In another mining case, in January 2019,
the Central Tibetan Administration, a political entity
based in Dharamsala, India, reported that due to a
``total clampdown on phones and other communications,''
they were unable to ascertain the current status of
villagers and village head Karma, in Driru (Biru)
county, Nagchu (Naqu) prefecture,\41\ whom authorities
detained in 2018 after they protested mining on a
sacred mountain.\42\
Environmental Degradation in the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region (IMAR). In April 2019, over
200 residents in Heshigten (Keshenketeng) Banner,
Chifeng municipality, IMAR, protested in front of a
government office after authorities imposed a grazing
ban on local herding communities.\43\ Heshigten police
criminally detained 68-year-old herder O. Sechenbaatar
on suspicion of ``obstructing official business.'' \44\
Also that month, more than 100 herders in Urad Middle
Banner in Bayanur (Bayannao'er) municipality, gathered
to request a meeting with the IMAR Party Secretary
about environmental degradation and inadequate
compensation to local residents who had been removed
from their grazing lands.\45\ Also in April, Hohhot
(Huhehaote) municipality authorities criminally
detained Heshigten resident Tsogjil, in connection to
WeChat discussion groups with 2,500 members which he
hosted that encouraged people to join a protest in
Heshigten.\46\ [For further information on the
suppression of herders protesting environmental
pollution in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, see
Section II--Ethnic Minority Rights.]
Waste Incineration in Hubei Province. In June
and July 2019, as many as ten thousand residents of
Xinzhou district, Wuhan municipality, protested against
a planned waste incineration plant.\47\ Chinese
authorities reportedly censored reporting on the
protests, blocked cell phone signals, and in some
instances, used violence against protestors.\48\
Media Reporting on Environmental Incidents and Corruption
During this reporting year, Chinese and international media
reported on incidents in which officials lied about
environmental problems, failed to take meaningful action
despite repeated environmental violations, or were involved in
environmental corruption, resulting in some cases of
disciplinary action against local officials. Despite
considerable censorship of the media in China,\49\ the
Commission observed some notable media reports on environmental
incidents:
In November 2018, a chemical spill in Quanzhou
municipality, Fujian province, resulted in the
hospitalization of 52 nearby residents, although at
first authorities instructed Chinese media not to
report on the leak.\50\ Domestic media later reported
that local officials initially lied about the cause and
size of the spill--authorities later stated that it was
10 times larger than first reported,\51\ prompting the
state-run newspaper China Daily to call for the
Quanzhou government to explain its shortcomings.\52\ A
female journalist from Caixin, a news outlet known for
more market-driven reporting, revealed that local
police harassed her while she was reporting on the
spill, including forcing their way into her hotel room
late one night to demand her press credentials and
following her around as she was gathering news.\53\ A
South China Morning Post editorial criticized the
``clumsy cover-up'' and said that ``[t]he habit of
cover-ups that put officials' political interests first
seems to die hard.'' \54\ Authorities disciplined two
police officers involved in the harassment of the
journalist \55\ and three local officials involved in
the alleged coverup efforts.\56\
In March 2019, an explosion at Jiangsu
Tianjiayi Chemical plant in Yancheng municipality,
Jiangsu province, killed 78 people, injured over 600,
and forced the evacuation of almost 3,000.\57\ Between
2016 and 2018, authorities had administratively
penalized the chemical plant over five times, including
an 18-month suspended sentence for the company chairman
for environmental violations.\58\ The Institute of
Public and Environmental Affairs (IPE), an
environmental non-governmental organization based in
Beijing municipality, had reportedly documented
environmental violations at 300 of 367 facilities at
the industrial park.\59\ After the explosion,
authorities announced plans to shut down all industrial
chemical facilities in the industrial park.\60\ Ma Jun,
IPE's director, nevertheless, told the Party-affiliated
media outlet Global Times that ``the complete shutdown
that resulted is not the best solution since the park
has an important role in the chemical industry.'' \61\
In April 2019, state-run media reported on
corruption at the environmental protection bureau in
Suining municipality, Sichuan province.\62\ A total of
32 officials at the bureau were reported to have
accepted bribes related to environmental matters,
including from companies under environmental
inspection.\63\
Assessing the Chinese Government's Commitment to Combat Climate Change
During the 2019 reporting year, carbon dioxide emissions in
China continued to increase, even as Chinese officials
continued to call for ``green development.'' Based on an
analysis of Chinese government data,\64\ carbon dioxide
emissions in China increased by approximately three percent in
2018.\65\ Coal consumption was reportedly responsible for more
than 70 percent of energy-related carbon dioxide emissions.\66\
According to analysts, however, official reports on coal
consumption and economic growth made it difficult to determine
China's carbon intensity--an essential metric used to assess
China's international commitment to combating climate
change.\67\ In April 2016, the Chinese government signed the
Paris Agreement,\68\ and its commitment under the agreement,
known as its nationally determined contribution (NDC), included
``lower[ing] carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60
percent to 65 percent from the 2005 level,'' ``achiev[ing] the
peaking of carbon dioxide emissions around 2030 and making best
efforts to peak early,'' and ``increas[ing] the share of non-
fossil fuels in primary energy consumption to around 20
percent.'' \69\ According to Climate Action Tracker, which
produces independent science research by a consortium of
research institutes, China's NDC is ``highly insufficient.''
\70\ In October 2018, the United Nations' Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change special report found that to limit
global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2050, global coal use
would need to be ``reduced to close to 0%.'' \71\ China has the
largest concentration of glaciers outside of the polar regions,
supplying water to 1.8 billion people, and the glaciers are at
risk due to global warming.\72\ From June 25 to 29, 2019, in
Lhasa municipality, TAR, the Chinese government recorded five
consecutive days with an average daily temperature at or above
71.6 degrees Farenheit (22 degrees Celsius), meeting the
Chinese government's definition for the beginning of summer for
the first time in Lhasa since authorities began measuring in
1955.\73\
International environmental groups and scientists were
skeptical about the Chinese government's reported plans to
suspend new coal-fired power plants in China and reduce methane
emissions from coal mines--major sources of greenhouse gases--
in light of a Chinese industry policy group's recommendation
that the government permit many new coal-fired power plants.
Although central authorities had reportedly suspended a number
of new coal-fired power plants in 2017, 2018 analysis of
satellite imagery by an environmental group found that many of
the suspended projects had resumed construction.\74\ In March
2019, the China Electricity Council, an industry association,
recommended that China increase its coal-fired power capacity
to 1,300 gigawatts,\75\ an increase of 290 gigawatts of new
coal-fired power capacity--more than the entire coal-fired
power capacity of the United States.\76\ In January 2019,
research published in Nature Communications found that although
the Chinese government had set ``ambitious benchmarks'' for
limiting methane production, based on satellite imagery, they
found that ``[the methane] regulations have had `no discernible
impact' on the continued increase in Chinese methane
emissions.'' \77\
This past year, as top Chinese officials proclaimed the
importance of green development, international concern
increased regarding Chinese government funding for coal-fired
power plants in countries participating in the Belt and Road
Initiative (BRI). In March 2019, at the BRI Forum in Beijing,
Chinese Communist Party General Secretary Xi Jinping said, ``We
need to pursue open, green and clean cooperation.'' \78\
Following the forum, attendees issued a joint communique
highlighting that ``communication among . . . think tanks,
academia, media, civil societies . . .'' would be welcomed.\79\
In 2019, reports that Chinese government-backed financial
institutions provided funding to build coal-fired power plants
abroad also raised international concerns.\80\ According to an
analysis by a group of international researchers, Chinese
financial institutions and corporations have offered funding to
more than one-quarter of coal-fired power plants under
construction outside of China.\81\ An international journalist
believes that these Chinese-funded power plants will ``make it
more difficult'' for some countries to meet their Paris
Agreement commitments.\82\ In July 2019, the UN special envoy
for the 2019 Climate Summit stated that ``[w]e would also like
China to encourage green investment throughout the Belt and
Road Initiative and not build coal-fired power plants.'' \83\
Wildlife Trade and Traditional Chinese Medicine
During this reporting year, the government continued to
promote the worldwide use of traditional Chinese medicine
leading to international concern about Chinese authorities'
commitment to fighting wildlife trafficking. According to a
Hong Kong-based foundation, ``[o]ne of the most alarming
characteristics of wildlife trafficking is the growing use of
threatened species in traditional medicines.'' \84\ By 2020,
the government plans to set up 50 traditional Chinese medicine
model centers outside China.\85\ In October 2018, the State
Council issued a circular that would permit the use of tiger
and rhinoceros bones for traditional Chinese medicine.\86\ The
Chinese government had prohibited trade in tiger bones and
rhino horns since 1993, when then-U.S. President Bill Clinton
threatened to sanction the Chinese government for undermining
the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of
Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES).\87\ CITES generally prohibits all
international trade in tigers, rhinos, and their derivative
parts,\88\ and the CITES standing committee has identified 36
facilities that keep tigers in China, the existence of which
``may be of concern.'' \89\ The UN Environment Programme
subsequently described any changes to the ban on the trade of
tiger and rhino parts as an ``extremely alarming development''
pointing out that such trade ``falsely indicates that these
products have medical value.'' \90\ Following international
criticism, in November 2018, the Chinese government announced
that implementation of the circular ``has been postponed after
study.'' \91\ According to an international wildlife
organization employee, ``[t]he lack of clarity does not help
the wildlife enforcement authorities to do their job.'' \92\
The General Administration of China Customs (China Customs)
reportedly cooperated with international non-governmental
organizations (NGOs) to combat wildlife trafficking through
educational outreach and identification of illicit
shipments.\93\ In April 2019, China Customs suggested that
``further cooperation'' with NGOs include ongoing publicization
of the ``positive outcomes'' of the Chinese government's
efforts to implement a ban on the ivory trade.\94\

Business and Human Rights
Findings
As the Chinese Communist Party and government
engage in increasingly egregious human rights
violations, domestic and international businesses are
increasingly at risk of complicity in abuses committed
by the Chinese government. Of particular concern are:
reports that companies are involved in the government's
suppression of ethnic minorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous Region (XUAR), including through the use of
forced labor; companies' complicity in government
surveillance of individuals throughout China; and
companies engaging in censorship on behalf of Chinese
authorities.
In the XUAR, the actions of the Party and
government may constitute crimes against humanity
according to scholars and rights groups, and companies
that work in the region are at great risk of complicity
in those crimes. Experts have documented the rapid
expansion of a network of mass internment camps in
which authorities have arbitrarily detained over a
million individuals from predominantly Muslim ethnic
minority groups. Commercial entities have been directly
involved in the construction of these camps and
supplied them with a wide range of goods and services.
The company Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, in
particular, has supplied surveillance systems to the
camps as part of a public-private partnership with XUAR
authorities. U.S.-based firms such as Intel, Ambarella,
and Nvidia reportedly continue to supply Hikvision with
critical components. According to a March 2019 report,
the California State Teachers' Retirement System and
the New York State Teachers' Retirement System both
continued to own Hikvision stock.
The Commission observed numerous reports this
past year of forced labor associated with government
repression of ethnic minority groups in the XUAR. In
some cases, detainees performed forced labor within the
camps. In other cases, detainees were ``released'' in
order to perform forced labor. In still other cases,
XUAR authorities reportedly assigned individuals from
ethnic minority groups to forced labor directly,
without first sending them to the camps. A Wall Street
Journal investigation found that materials from firms
using forced labor in the XUAR had entered the supply
chains of major international clothing companies
including Adidas, H&M, Nike, and Patagonia.
Chinese security authorities continued to work
with domestic companies to expand the reach and
analytical power of government surveillance systems.
Chinese technology firms ZTE, Hikvision, iFlytek,
Huawei Technologies, SenseTime, Megvii, CloudWalk,
Yitu, and Tiandy all reportedly sold technology to
Chinese authorities for use in surveillance systems.
This surveillance is used to target rights advocates
and others whom the government views as a threat. For
example, police in at least 16 provinces and regions
were reportedly using artificial intelligence (AI) to
track the movement of Uyghurs, an ethnic minority
group.
Companies in China collect large amounts of
data on Chinese citizens and are required under Chinese
law to make this data available to authorities. In the
wake of rising domestic concerns over data collection
and misuse, the government has already begun to revise
recent regulations governing consumer data collection.
While the government has punished companies over the
collection of consumer data in some instances, the
government has simultaneously expanded its own data
collection powers.
Chinese government restrictions on freedom of
expression increased this past year, and companies--
particularly tech companies--were both targets and
enablers of Chinese government censorship. For example,
Tencent's WeChat--a ubiquitous social media app in
China--regularly filters and censors content and turns
over user information to authorities. In 2018, media
reports revealed that Google was developing a censored
version of its search engine in an attempt to re-enter
the Chinese market. Following employee protests and
media attention, Google's Vice President for Government
Affairs and Public Policy informed the Congress in July
2019 that Google had ``terminated'' the search engine
project.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Take the necessary steps to prohibit the export of
U.S. goods and services to Chinese entities--including
government agencies and companies--that have been
directly involved in building and supplying the system
of internment camps in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous
Region (XUAR). Specifically, the video surveillance
company Hangzhou Hikvision Digital Technology, which
has supplied the camps with surveillance equipment and
is complicit in state surveillance of ethnic minorities
more generally, should be placed on the Entity List of
the Bureau of Industry and Security (BIS) within the
U.S. Department of Commerce.
Impose Global Magnitsky sanctions on both Chinese
government officials carrying out severe human rights
abuses in the XUAR as well as the companies directly
complicit in those abuses. U.S. Customs and Border
Protection should examine the import of goods made in
the XUAR--or containing materials made in the XUAR--and
determine whether such imports violate Section 1307 of
the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1307).
The Department of Labor should update its list of
goods produced with child labor or forced labor to
reflect the recent reports of forced labor in the XUAR.
Hold public hearings and private meetings with
companies from their districts to raise awareness of
the risks of complicity in human rights abuses that
U.S. companies working in China may face, including
complicity in possible crimes against humanity in the
XUAR; the possibility of goods made with forced labor
entering supply chains; and the use of AI technology
and surveillance equipment to monitor human rights
advocates, religious believers, and ethnic minorities.
Encourage companies in their districts to engage in
appropriate due diligence with regard to potential
complicity in human rights abuses. For additional
resources on best practices, companies may consult the
UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development
(OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, and
the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible
Business Conduct.

Introduction
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year, the Chinese
Communist Party and government engaged in increasingly
egregious human rights violations, as detailed by international
human rights organizations and in the other sections of this
report.\1\ In this environment, domestic and international
businesses are directly complicit in or at risk of complicity
in human rights abuses committed by the Chinese government,
including the severe repression of minority groups in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), government
surveillance of citizens without adequate privacy protections,
and government censorship. Technology companies, in particular,
play a major role in government surveillance and censorship,
and Human Rights Watch warned companies operating in China that
``the authorities might deploy [their] technology to commit
serious abuses.'' \2\ Although the Chinese government requires
companies to comply with domestic laws and regulations that
infringe on internationally recognized rights such as the right
to privacy and freedom of expression, the UN Guiding Principles
on Business and Human Rights state that businesses have a
responsibility to respect human rights and should seek to avoid
``contributing to adverse human rights impacts . . ..'' \3\
Whereas the preceding sections of this report examine in detail
Chinese government violations of human rights and relevant
international human rights standards, this section focuses on
the risk domestic and international companies face of
complicity in these human rights violations.
Corporate Involvement in Possible Crimes Against Humanity in the XUAR
The actions of the Chinese Communist Party and government
in the XUAR may constitute crimes against humanity \4\
according to scholars and rights groups.\5\ This past year,
experts documented the expansion of a network of mass
internment camps in which authorities have arbitrarily detained
over a million individuals from predominantly Muslim ethnic
minority groups.\6\ Outside the camps, members of ethnic
minority groups in the XUAR face extreme levels of
surveillance, restrictions on freedom of movement, and forced
political indoctrination.\7\ Companies that work in the XUAR
are at great risk of complicity in the human rights abuses
being committed in the region.\8\ [For more information on
human rights violations in the XUAR, including a discussion of
possible crimes against humanity committed by Chinese
authorities, see Section IV--Xinjiang.]
COMPANIES USING FORCED LABOR IN THE XUAR
The Commission observed numerous reports this past year of
forced labor associated with government repression of ethnic
minority groups in the XUAR. In some cases, detainees performed
forced labor in factories within internment camps.\9\ In other
cases, authorities released individuals from the camps to
perform forced labor in factories elsewhere in the XUAR.\10\ In
still other cases, XUAR authorities reportedly assigned
individuals from ethnic minority groups to forced labor
directly, without first sending them to the camps.\11\ Radio
Free Asia (RFA) reported in January 2019 that authorities had
also sent Uyghurs and Kazakhs from the XUAR to other provinces
in China for forced labor.\12\ Comments from the president of
the China National Textile and Apparel Council in March 2018
suggested that textile manufacturers, in particular, were
working with XUAR authorities to exploit detainee labor.\13\
More recent reports found that authorities used tax exemptions
and subsidies to encourage Chinese garment manufacturers to
move production to the XUAR.\14\ German scholar Adrian Zenz
warned that ``[s]oon, many or most products made in China that
rely at least in part on low-skilled, labor-intensive
manufacturing, could contain elements of involuntary ethnic
minority labor from Xinjiang.'' \15\ [For more information on
forced labor in the XUAR and elsewhere in China, see Section
II--Human Trafficking.]
Products reportedly produced with forced labor by current
and former camp detainees included:
textiles, such as yarn, clothing, gloves,
bedding, and carpet; \16\
electronics, including cell phones and
computer hardware and software; \17\
food products, including noodles and cakes;
\18\
shoes; \19\
tea; \20\ and
handicrafts.\21\
Companies that used forced labor in the XUAR this past year
included:
Hetian Taida Apparel,\22\ a supplier of the
U.S. company Badger Sportswear; \23\
Yili Zhou Wan Garment Manufacturing Company;
\24\
Zhihui Haipai Internet of Things Technology
Company; \25\
Urumqi Shengshi Hua'er Culture Technology
Limited Company; \26\
Litai Textiles; \27\
Huafu Fashion Company, whose yarn reportedly
entered the supply chains for H&M, Esprit, and Adidas;
\28\
Esquel Group, headquartered in Hong Kong,
which reportedly supplied clothing to Calvin Klein,
Tommy Hilfiger, Nike, and Patagonia; \29\ and
Cofco Tunhe Company, which supplied tomato
paste to Kraft Heinz and Campbell Soup, and sugar to
Coca-Cola.\30\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clothing Made With Forced Labor Imported Into United States
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In January 2019, U.S. company Badger Sportswear \31\ (Badger) stopped
importing clothing from Hetian Taida Apparel (Hetian Taida), following
media reports that the clothing was made with forced labor by
internment camp detainees.\32\ The Associated Press (AP) tracked
shipments from Hetian Taida workshops located within an internment camp
to Badger, and the U.S.-based Worker Rights Consortium independently
confirmed that the Hetian Taida factory supplying Badger was located
inside a camp.\33\ The chairman of Hetian Taida confirmed to the AP
that his workforce included ``trainees'' from the camp.\34\ Badger said
it relied on the U.S.-based social compliance nonprofit Worldwide
Responsible Accredited Production (WRAP) to certify that its suppliers
met certain standards.\35\ Following media reports, WRAP conducted its
own investigation, concluding that ``this facility is not engaged in
the use of forced labor.'' \36\ WRAP later admitted to the AP, however,
that it had not visited the facility in question, but rather a separate
Hetian Taida workshop located elsewhere.\37\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
SURVEILLANCE STATE IN THE XUAR
Outside the network of extrajudicial internment camps,
ethnic minority groups in the XUAR faced near-constant
government surveillance in their daily lives,\38\ in violation
of the internationally recognized right to privacy.\39\
Numerous companies--both Chinese and international--have
facilitated what Human Rights Watch describes as ``Orwellian
surveillance'' in the XUAR.\40\
In October 2018, the video surveillance
research firm IPVM provided evidence that the video
surveillance company Hangzhou Hikvision Digital
Technology was directly involved in the construction,
operation, and ongoing maintenance of the Integrated
Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) in the XUAR.\41\ Human
Rights Watch has described the IJOP as a ``predictive
policing'' system that aggregates and analyzes large
amounts of individuals' data, flagging ``those it deems
potentially threatening.'' \42\ In addition to tracking
them, authorities may arbitrarily detain individuals
flagged by the IJOP in the internment camps or other
detention facilities.\43\ Hikvision also reportedly
contracted with local XUAR authorities to build
surveillance systems to install in mosques in some
localities in the XUAR as part of a public-private
partnership.\44\
Despite Hikvision's involvement in both the
XUAR's network of extrajudicial camps and the IJOP,
foreign suppliers such as Intel, Ambarella, and Nvidia
reportedly sold computer processing chips and graphics
chips to Hikvision, and the U.S. data storage company
Seagate provided the company with ``custom storage
solutions'' for its surveillance systems, according to
a November 2018 Financial Times report.\45\ Foreign
Policy further reported in March 2019 that the U.S.-
based company Amax, which provides advanced computing
technology, had formed a partnership with
Hikvision.\46\ Hikvision is listed on the Shenzhen
stock exchange and is 41.88 percent owned by two
subsidiaries of the Chinese state-owned enterprise
China Electronics Technology Corporation (CETC).\47\
CETC is also involved in managing government
surveillance systems in the XUAR, including the
IJOP.\48\
Hikvision was one of the Chinese companies
that index provider MSCI included in its emerging
markets index, which means that funds investing in the
index are investing in Hikvision.\49\ MSCI announced
plans in February 2019 to quadruple the weight of
mainland Chinese shares in the index.\50\ According to
a March 2019 Financial Times article, the California
State Teachers' Retirement System and the New York
State Teachers' Retirement System both owned stock in
Hikvision.\51\ In addition, U.S. public relations firms
Burson-Marsteller \52\ and Mercury Public Affairs are
registered with the U.S. Department of Justice as
foreign agents working on behalf of Hikvision in the
U.S.\53\
In February 2019, a cybersecurity researcher
discovered that the Chinese firm SenseNets had left a
database tracking over 2.5 million people in the XUAR
exposed online.\54\ The database tracked individuals'
GPS coordinates--seemingly in real time--and also
contained government identification numbers, dates of
birth, photos, home addresses, and employers.\55\
According to experts, the information in this database
suggested that authorities in the XUAR were working
with SenseNets to monitor residents.\56\
Bloomberg and the Financial Times reported
that SenseTime had set up a ``smart policing'' joint
venture in the XUAR with Urumqi-based Leon Technology
(Leon) called Xinjiang SenseTime Leon Technology.\57\
According to Leon's website and the company's page on a
job-listing website, among Leon's main customers were
XUAR government agencies, including the XUAR public
security bureau.\58\ In March 2019, SenseTime sold its
stake in the joint venture with Leon, possibly to avoid
negative publicity in preparation for its planned
initial public offering (IPO).\59\ According to
Bloomberg, with investors such as Qualcomm, Fidelity
International, and Alibaba, SenseTime was ``the world's
most valuable AI startup.'' \60\ A May 2019 BuzzFeed
News investigation found that private equity firms IDG
Capital and Silver Lake both owned shares in
SenseTime.\61\ Those firms' clients reportedly included
14 public pension funds.\62\
Reports emerged this past year that XUAR
authorities purchased a video management system from
Infinova, a U.S.-based company that is listed on the
Shenzhen stock exchange, for use in urban surveillance
systems in the XUAR.\63\ According to IPVM, XUAR
authorities have purchased the company's surveillance
technology in the past.\64\
In April 2019, the Wall Street Journal
reported that U.S. firms, including Boeing and Carlyle
Group, had ``indirectly facilitated'' the Chinese
government's use of American-made satellites to aid in
communications during protests and strife in the XUAR
in 2009.\65\ The Hong Kong-based intermediary that sold
the satellite bandwidth to Chinese authorities,
AsiaSat, ``declined to comment directly'' when asked if
police in the XUAR continued to use the satellites.\66\
OTHER COMMERCIAL CONNECTIONS TO XUAR AUTHORITIES
The Commission observed additional instances of connections
between companies and XUAR authorities that raised human rights
concerns. For example, the U.S.-based firm Thermo Fisher
Scientific sold DNA analysis equipment to XUAR authorities
until February 2019, ending sales following criticism from
Human Rights Watch (HRW) and members of the U.S. Congress.\67\
According to the New York Times, procurement documents showed
that Chinese authorities intended for some of Thermo Fisher's
equipment to be used by XUAR police.\68\ A 2017 HRW article
highlighted Thermo Fisher's sales of DNA sequencers to XUAR
police, with HRW's China Director calling the mass, involuntary
collection of DNA from Uyghurs in the region ``a gross
violation of international human rights norms.'' \69\ In
addition, in January 2019, the Hong Kong-based security
services company Frontier Services Group (FSG) announced on its
website that it had signed an agreement with local XUAR
officials to build a training facility in Kashgar prefecture,
XUAR.\70\ The announcement, since removed, noted that the
agreement was part of a ``strategic cooperation framework
agreement'' (zhanlue xiezuo kuangjia xieyi) between the state-
owned company CITIC Group, which owns controlling shares in
FSG, and the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, a Han-
Chinese led paramilitary institution that operates across the
XUAR.\71\ FSG's American co-founder, Erik Prince, who remains a
minority shareholder and deputy chairman of the board, claimed
``no knowledge'' of the company's plans to build a training
center in the XUAR.\72\
Commercial Firms' Role in Government Data Collection and Surveillance
Across China
EVOLVING REGULATORY REGIME
Chinese law allows the government to collect personal data
from companies without adequate protections for the
internationally recognized right to privacy.\73\ For example,
the PRC Cybersecurity Law requires companies to store user data
inside mainland China \74\ and to provide technical support to
authorities conducting criminal investigations or ``protecting
state security,'' \75\ without specifying what such technical
support entails.\76\ The PRC National Intelligence Law
similarly requires entities operating in China--including
companies--to provide support and assistance to authorities
engaged in ``intelligence work'' without defining what the
government considers ``intelligence work.'' \77\
In September 2018, the Ministry of Public Security issued
implementing provisions that further detailed the government's
authority under the Cybersecurity Law.\78\ The new provisions
allow police to inspect data centers, internet service
providers, and others, providing for both on-site and remote
inspections and allowing police to copy ``relevant
information'' from the companies they inspect.\79\ Experts note
that companies typically must comply with government demands to
provide information.\80\ Chapter 4 of the implementing
regulations stipulates potential criminal penalties for failure
to comply.\81\
In the wake of rising domestic concerns over data
collection and misuse, the government has already begun to
revise recent regulations governing consumer data
collection.\82\ Observers noted that while the government has
punished companies over the collection of consumer data in some
instances, the government has simultaneously expanded its own
data collection powers--in some cases leading to conflicting
guidance for businesses over whether and when to retain user
data.\83\
SOCIAL CREDIT SYSTEM
The Chinese government continued to work with Chinese
companies to develop and implement a social credit system that
aimed to aggregate and monitor the data that the government and
companies collect. Legal scholars and observers warned that the
system could increase the government's capacity for social
control and potentially violate the internationally recognized
rights to privacy, due process, and freedom of expression.\84\
In 2014, the State Council released an outline for the creation
of a national social credit system by 2020 to measure and
improve the credibility of government agencies, organizations,
and individuals.\85\ All Chinese individuals and organizations
must now have a unique social credit code, including
multinational companies operating in China.\86\ Private
companies such as Ant Financial also offer private credit
scoring services that collect large amounts of customer
data.\87\ While these services are separate from the government
system, the government has the authority to access the
companies' data.\88\ In the case of Ant Financial's Sesame
Credit, the company is reportedly providing information
directly to the entity that oversees the government's social
credit system.\89\
CONTINUED EXPANSION OF SURVEILLANCE NETWORKS
Chinese security authorities continued to work with
domestic companies to expand the reach and analytical power of
government surveillance systems. In February 2019, the Chinese
Communist Party Central Committee called for the expansion of
the rural surveillance system dubbed ``Sharp Eyes.'' \90\
According to the Nikkei Asian Review, numerous Chinese firms
have supplied equipment and services to the government for the
Sharp Eyes project, including Hikvision, ZTE, iFlytek, Inspur,
Huawei Technologies, and Alibaba Group Holding.\91\ In addition
to the Sharp Eyes surveillance project, Chinese technology
firms SenseTime, Megvii, and Tiandy all reportedly sold
technology to Chinese authorities for use in other surveillance
systems.\92\ For example, SenseTime sold artificial
intelligence (AI) technology to police in China in the form of
SenseTotem and SenseFace surveillance systems.\93\ In April
2019, the New York Times revealed that police departments in at
least 16 provinces and regions were using AI to track the
movement of Uyghurs, an ethnic minority group.\94\ Chinese
companies CloudWalk, Megvii, Yitu, and SenseTime assisted
authorities in this surveillance.\95\ The head of China equity
strategy for Credit Suisse noted that for many Chinese AI
firms, their ``biggest business'' was government surveillance
projects.\96\ As one human rights advocate noted, while the
Chinese government claims these surveillance projects target
criminals, ``police treat those that exercise basic civil
liberties like peaceful assembly or freedom of association as
criminals.'' \97\
U.S. firms have also assisted in the development of Chinese
government surveillance systems. According to a November 2018
Wall Street Journal report, the U.S. chipmaker Nvidia has sold
chips to SenseTime.\98\ Nvidia has also sold chips to
Hikvision, one of the Chinese firms that has been integral to
the construction of government surveillance systems.\99\ The
U.S. consulting firm McKinsey & Company reportedly assisted
local governments in China to implement ``smart cities''
surveillance systems.\100\ In the words of one expert, these
``smart cities'' projects are ``about political control.''
\101\
Role of Commercial Firms in Government Censorship
Chinese government restrictions on freedom of expression
increased this past year, and companies--particularly tech
companies--were both targets and enablers of Chinese government
censorship. The international non-governmental organization
Freedom House called the Chinese government ``the worst abuser
of internet freedom in 2018,'' \102\ and Human Rights Watch
reported that the government continued to censor ``politically
sensitive information'' online.\103\ The PRC Cybersecurity Law
requires companies to monitor content their customers create or
share, censor content that violates laws and regulations, and
report such content to authorities.\104\ New regulations,\105\
censorship campaigns,\106\ and increasing restrictions on the
use of virtual private networks (VPNs) \107\ this past year
have further circumscribed online expression. In 2018,
regulators reportedly shut down over 6,000 websites.\108\ From
January 3 to 21, 2019, the Cyberspace Administration of China
shut down 733 websites and 9,382 mobile apps, and deleted over
7 million pieces of online information.\109\ [For more
information on censorship in China, see Section II--Freedom of
Expression.]
Faced with the possibility of lost revenue and other forms
of punishment, both domestic and international companies
engaged in self-censorship. For example, Tencent's WeChat--a
ubiquitous social media app in China--regularly filters and
censors content and turns over user information to
authorities.\110\ In 2018, online news outlet The Intercept
revealed that Google was developing a censored version of its
search engine, called ``Project Dragonfly,'' in an attempt to
re-enter the Chinese market.\111\ Work on the project appeared
to end in late 2018 following employee protests and media
attention.\112\ Google's Vice President for Government Affairs
and Public Policy told the Senate Judiciary Committee in July
2019 that Google had ``terminated'' Project Dragonfly.\113\
Not only do companies engage in self-censorship, censorship
itself can be a lucrative business in China. The online version
of the Party-run newspaper People's Daily, People.cn, contracts
with companies such as the news aggregator Jinri Toutiao to
censor content that contravenes government censorship
directives.\114\ Revenue from People.cn's censorship services
reportedly rose 166 percent in 2018.\115\ Another censorship
service, Rainbow Shield, owned by the company Beyondsoft,
employs over 4,000 people in multiple cities to review online
content.\116\ In Chengdu municipality, Sichuan province, 160
Beyondsoft employees reportedly monitor a single news-
aggregating app for politically sensitive content.\117\ [For

III. Development of the Rule of Law
Civil Society
Findings
In the past few years, the Chinese government
has harshly repressed human rights lawyers, women's
rights advocates, labor rights defenders, citizen
journalists, and petitioners. Some previously tolerated
``gray areas'' of civil society experienced what
experts describe as a ``chilling effect.'' In
conjunction with the continued implementation of
legislative and regulatory reforms passed in 2016 and
the increased role and purview of the Chinese Communist
Party over all aspects of Chinese society, the space
which non-governmental organizations (NGOs) had to
carry out human rights advocacy activities continued to
shrink.
The Chinese government's efforts to promote
its vision for ``human rights with Chinese
characteristics'' at the November 2018 session of the
UN Human Rights Council's (UNHRC) Universal Periodic
Review undermined principles in the international human
rights framework. A September 2018 Brookings
Institution report examining China's activities at the
UNHRC from 2016 to 2018 concluded that the Chinese
government opposed international standards of
legitimate civil society activity and association and
is in favor of limiting the power and freedom of civil
society organizations. As Chinese government influence
in international organizations continues to grow,
support from democratic states is critical to upholding
civil society's role as independent human rights and
rule of law watchdogs.
Chinese government efforts to suppress labor
advocacy and to label such efforts as driven by foreign
interests make it increasingly difficult for workers in
China to organize grassroots efforts and advocate for
their rights. Chinese authorities carried out a large-
scale nationwide crackdown on labor rights advocates
that began in July 2018 when workers at a Jasic
Technology factory in Shenzhen municipality, Guangdong
province, attempted to organize a labor union and
received widespread national support from university
students and internet users. Authorities portrayed the
labor protests as orchestrated by a ``foreign-funded''
NGO, and detained, forcibly disappeared, harassed, and
physically assaulted labor advocates and their
supporters.
In the fall of 2018, Chinese authorities
carried out a broad crackdown on unregistered
Protestant churches (``house churches''), including
Zion Church (banned in September 2018) and Shouwang
Church (banned in March 2019) in Beijing municipality;
Rongguili Church in Guangzhou municipality, Guangdong
province (banned in December 2018); and Early Rain
Covenant Church in Chengdu municipality, Sichuan
province (banned in December 2018). The government's
efforts to ban major unregistered churches this past
year is part of the intensification of national policy
against religious groups throughout China.
In the face of pressure and censorship from
the government against the growing #MeToo movement in
China, women's rights advocates continued to carry out
their advocacy on social media, negotiate with
officials, and offer support to survivors of sexual
harassment. Women's rights advocates use online
networks and forums to organize advocacy, offer
support, and create a network among supporters. Despite
the government's efforts to shut down social media
platforms of gender-based advocacy, advocates continue
to establish new networks and seek ways to offer
support to those who need it.
In addition to implementing the PRC Law on the
Management of Overseas Non-Governmental Organizations'
Activities in Mainland China, the Chinese government
highlighted overseas NGOs that threatened China's
``political security'' and urged citizens to report
violations of the law. The Chinese government has
intensified efforts to root out illegal overseas NGOs
by using the internet and mobilizing Chinese citizens.
The lack of a definition for what is considered
threatening to China's ``political security'' gives the
Chinese government unlimited latitude to crack down on
organizations working on human rights and rule of law
advocacy.
Chinese central- and provincial-level
authorities continued to implement the national
campaign launched in 2018 to clamp down on domestic
``illegal social organizations'' that do not possess
proper government registration or that perform
activities outside the scope of those for which they
have registered, targeting those that ``threaten state
security and social stability.'' In September 2018, the
Ministry of Civil Affairs released an action plan to
monitor the online activities of groups and mobilize
public reporting of illegal activities online in order
to crack down on illegal organizations. Internet
surveillance and the use of big data, combined with
citizen reporting, narrows the space of operation for
organizations that have not obtained official approval,
including those focused on human rights advocacy in
China.
The Chinese government continued to suppress
the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and
questioning (LGBTQ) individuals in China. LGBTQ
individuals faced a multitude of challenges, including
a lack of legal protections. The Chinese government
cracked down on organizations and rights defenders
active on LGBTQ issues. Nevertheless, LGBTQ advocates
supported online campaigns highlighting workplace
discrimination and sexual harassment, and censorship.
The Chinese government has not followed multiple
recommendations from UN bodies regarding LGBTQ
protections.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Urge the Chinese government to revise or repeal the
PRC Law on the Management of Overseas NGOs' Activities
in Mainland China and revise the PRC Charity Law to
reflect the principles of the International Covenant on
Civil and Political Rights, especially with regard to
the rights to freedom of association, assembly, and
expression.
Urge the Chinese government to refrain from using
legal provisions or government policy to crack down on
civil society advocates and organizations working on
human rights.
Call on the Chinese government to cease harassment
and arbitrary detention of civil society advocates and
NGOs and provide adequate procedural due process to
those individuals subject to criminal investigation and
trial.
Call on the Chinese government to stop censoring and
shutting down social media accounts and internet-based
platforms of civil society organizations working on
rights advocacy.
Oppose efforts by the Chinese government at the UN
Human Rights Council to undermine universal human
rights standards and urge Chinese officials to adopt
policies that encourage civil society organizations in
China to uphold universal norms and become independent
from the government.
Integrate civil society issues into bilateral
discussions and agreements with Chinese officials to
promote reciprocity in the approach and implementation
of civil society exchanges between the United States
and China.
Continue to fund, monitor, and evaluate foreign
assistance programs in China that support democracy
promotion, rule of law, and human rights advocacy.
Take measures to facilitate the participation of
Chinese civil society advocates in relevant
international conferences and forums and support
international training to build their leadership
capacity in non-profit management, public policy
advocacy, and media relations.

Introduction
Since Chinese President and Communist Party General
Secretary Xi Jinping came into power in late 2012, the space
for civil society in China has become more regulated and
restricted.\1\ Under Xi's rule, moreover, the crackdown on
civil society has intensified over the past few years as the
government targeted different sectors of civil society that
advocate for human rights and the rule of law.\2\ In the past
few years, the Chinese government has harshly repressed human
rights lawyers, women's rights advocates, labor rights
defenders, citizen journalists, and petitioners for peacefully
exercising their rights.\3\ Some previously tolerated ``gray
areas'' of civil society experienced what experts describe as a
``chilling effect.'' \4\ In conjunction with the continued
implementation of legislative and regulatory reforms passed in
2016 \5\ and the increased role and purview of the Party over
all aspects of Chinese society,\6\ the space in which non-
governmental organizations (NGOs) had to carry out human rights
advocacy activities continued to shrink.\7\
The number of Chinese NGOs is difficult to determine, in
part because of the complex regulatory framework, the existence
of unregistered NGOs and informal associations, the pace of
growth of the non-governmental and non-profit sector, and the
range of different types of such organizations.\8\ According to
the Ministry of Civil Affairs, at the end of 2018, China had
816,027 registered ``social organizations'' (shehui zuzhi)--the
official term for NGOs \9\--that consisted of 443,000 non-
governmental, non-commercial organizations (minban feiqiye
danwei), also called social service organizations (shehui fuwu
jigou); 7,027 foundations (jijinhui); and 366,000 social
associations (shehui tuanti).\10\ Many social associations,
however, are government-organized non-governmental
organizations (GONGOs) and therefore have close ties to the
government.\11\ Many NGOs, with few or no ties to the
government, remain unregistered or are registered as business
entities due to restrictions and barriers to registration
imposed by the government.\12\
Universal Periodic Review
At the November 2018 session of the UN Human Rights
Council's (UNHRC) Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of the
Chinese government's human rights record, the Chinese
government continued to promote its vision for ``human rights
with Chinese characteristics.'' \13\ A September 2018 Brookings
Institution report outlined China's activities at the UNHRC
from 2016 to 2018 and concluded that the Chinese government
opposed international definitions of civil society and is in
favor of limiting the power and freedom of civil society
organizations.\14\ The Brookings report urged support from
democratic states to ``protect [Chinese] civil society's vital
role as independent watchdogs for upholding universal norms.''
\15\ During the 2018 UPR, Estonia recommended that China enable
civil society to ``freely engage with international human
rights mechanisms without fear of intimidation and reprisals,''
while Greece recommended that China ``ensure a safe environment
for journalists and other civil society actors to carry out
their work.'' \16\ In January 2019, 40 international NGOs sent
a joint appeal urging the UNHRC to issue a resolution
addressing human rights violations in China, particularly in
light of the large-scale arbitrary detention of Uyghurs and
other predominantly Muslim ethnic groups in the Xinjiang Uyghur
Autonomous Region.\17\ [For more information on the mass
detention of Uyghurs and other Turkic Muslims, see Section IV--
Xinjiang.]
Government Suppression of Civil Society
This past year, government authorities continued to
suppress Chinese human rights advocates and unregistered
organizations.\18\ These instances included the following:
Labor rights advocates: Beginning in July
2018, Chinese authorities carried out a large-scale
nationwide crackdown on labor advocates after workers
at a Jasic Technology factory in Shenzhen municipality,
Guangdong province, began protests and attempted to
organize a labor union.\19\ After the workers at Jasic
received support from Chinese university students and
internet users,\20\ Chinese state-run media outlet
Xinhua portrayed the labor protests as orchestrated by
a ``foreign funded'' NGO.\21\ By February 2019,
authorities had detained or forcibly disappeared over
50 people, including workers, labor advocates,
Marxists, students, and graduates from different
universities.\22\ In addition to detaining,
prosecuting, harassing, and physically assaulting
members of the student-led Jasic Workers' Solidarity
Group, formed in support of the Jasic workers, Chinese
authorities also prevented the group from meeting
together.\23\ [For more information on worker rights in
China, see Section II--Worker Rights.]
Unregistered Christian churches: Chinese
authorities carried out a broad crackdown on
unregistered Protestant churches (``house churches''),
as part of an intensification of government pressure on
religious groups that previously had gathered without
much government interference,\24\ including Zion Church
(banned in September 2018) and Shouwang Church (banned
in March 2019) in Beijing municipality; \25\ Rongguili
Church in Guangzhou municipality, Guangdong province
(banned in December 2018); \26\ and Early Rain Covenant
Church in Chengdu municipality, Sichuan province
(banned in December 2018).\27\ Beginning on December 9,
2018, public security officials in Chengdu took into
custody or detained over 100 leaders and members of the
Early Rain Covenant Church--including its pastor Wang
Yi and his wife Jiang Rong on the charge of ``inciting
subversion of state power.'' \28\ [For more information
on religious persecution in China, see Section II--
Freedom of Religion.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Registration for Religious Groups: The Chinese government requires
religious groups to register based on provisions in the Regulations on
Religious Affairs (RRA).\29\ Under President Xi Jinping, Chinese
authorities have intensified efforts to force house churches to obtain
official registration.\30\ Citing the RRA, Chinese authorities required
house churches across China to submit registration forms and to provide
personal information on church members.\31\ In January 2019, the State
Administration for Religious Affairs and the Ministry of Civil Affairs
issued a joint notice on the registration of religious venues that
specifies requirements for religious groups seeking authorization to
receive donations to not only obtain approval by the local government
religious affairs bureau before applying for official registration with
the local government civil affairs bureau, but also to provide
information on finances from an authorized accounting firm as well as
the social credit numbers of group leaders.\32\ [For more information
on the social credit system, see Section II--Business and Human
Rights.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Women's rights advocacy: Despite pressure and
censorship from the government against the growing
#MeToo movement in China, women's rights advocates
continued to ``use social media, negotiate with the
authorities, and offer support to survivors [of sexual
harassment].'' \33\ In December 2018, the Guangzhou
Gender and Sexuality Education Center closed after some
staff reportedly received threats from Chinese
authorities.\34\ A January 2019 Foreign Policy report
highlighted that NGOs were the first in responding to
the needs of victims of sexual harassment since the
#MeToo movement emerged in 2018, particularly in
adopting comprehensive anti-sexual harassment measures
and fielding sexual harassment-related inquiries.\35\
For example, a grassroots network consisting of
hundreds of volunteers that connects victims to
activists, lawyers, and psychologists is reportedly
underway.\36\ [For more information on gender-based
advocacy in China, see Section II--Status of Women.]
Foreign NGOs' Activities in China
This past year, the government continued to carry out the
PRC Law on the Management of Overseas Non-Governmental
Organizations' Activities in Mainland China (Overseas NGOs'
Activities Law) which took effect in January 2017.\37\ By
August 2019, 496 international NGOs (INGOs) had successfully
registered representative offices and INGOs had filed 2,065
temporary activity permits in China, according to official data
posted to the Ministry of Public Security's Overseas Non-
Governmental Organizations Services Platform.\38\ In 2018, the
number of representative offices registered per month by INGOs
began to decline and level off at fewer than ten per month.\39\
In contrast, the number of temporary activities filed by INGOs
increased in the second half of 2018, peaking in November 2018
with 124, and dropped to 34 in February 2019 before leveling
off to around 65 per month beginning in May 2019.\40\ Asia
Society's China NGO Project surmised that the increase in
temporary activity filings in 2018 can be attributed to the
greater overall familiarity of government officials, groups,
and local Chinese partner units with the filing process.\41\
INGOs with representative offices work most commonly in the
sectors of trade, international relations, education, youth,
health, and poverty alleviation; with the exception of trade,
INGOs with temporary activities work predominantly in the same
sectors.\42\
In addition to implementing the Overseas NGOs' Activities
Law, the government and Party singled out overseas NGOs that
allegedly threatened China's ``political security'' and urged
citizens to report violations of the Overseas NGOs' Activities
Law. The People's Daily, a Party-run media outlet, detailed in
an April 2019 article how two foreign NGOs--Chinese Urgent
Action Working Group (CUAWG), run by formerly detained Swedish
citizen Peter Dahlin, and South Korean missionary group
InterCP--``endangered political security'' in China.\43\ The
article accused CUAWG of accepting large sums of money from
foreign organizations and called the staff of CUAWG
``informants planted in China by Western anti-China forces.''
\44\ In March 2019, the Guangzhou Municipal Bureau of Ethnic
and Religious Affairs in Guangdong issued an official measure
to encourage citizens to report illegal religious activity,
offering cash rewards of 3,000 to 10,000 yuan (US$436 to
US$1,455) to Chinese citizens who provide assistance in
reporting or tracking down illegal overseas religious
organizations and staff.\45\ In another instance, in January
2019, the Public Security Bureau in Qidong city, Nantong
municipality, Jiangsu province, published a WeChat post, which
was reposted by the Ministry of Public Security, instructing
citizens on how to recognize and report illegal foreign NGO
activities to public security authorities.\46\

Arbitrary Detention of Canadian Citizen Michael Kovrig in China
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
On December 10, 2018, authorities from the Ministry of State Security in
Beijing municipality detained Canadian citizen and employee of the non-
governmental organization International Crisis Group (ICG) Michael
Kovrig on suspicion of ``endangering state security.'' \47\ Kovrig's
detention took place days after Canadian authorities arrested Meng
Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the Chinese company Huawei, in
Vancouver \48\ at the request of U.S. officials who sought to extradite
Meng on charges that include violation of sanctions on Iran.\49\ During
a press conference on December 12, a Ministry of Foreign Affairs
spokesperson said that Kovrig may have been detained under the Overseas
NGOs' Activities Law, saying the ICG ``has not legally registered or
submitted documents for the record'' in China.\50\ An assessment by
Asia Society's ChinaFile said that the Chinese government's reference
to the Overseas NGOs' Activities Law after detaining Kovrig may suggest
that the law could ``easily be used for political ends and is not a
safe or reliable mechanism'' for foreign NGOs working in China.\51\ A
Reuters report said that Kovrig's detention was ``sending chills''
through foreign NGO workers in China.\52\ [For more information on
Michael Kovrig's case, see Section II--Criminal Justice.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Overall Regulatory Environment for Domestic NGOs
This past year, Chinese central- and provincial-level
authorities continued to implement the national campaign
launched in 2018 to clamp down on ``illegal social
organizations'' that do not possess proper government
registration or that perform activities outside the scope of
those for which they have registered,\53\ targeting those that
``threaten state security and social stability.'' \54\ In 2018,
the Ministry of Civil Affairs (MCA) and the Ministry of Public
Security investigated 5,845 organizations and ``exposed'' more
than 300 suspected ``illegal organizations.'' \55\ Under the
direction of the central government,\56\ provincial- and local-
level governments took action to curb illegal organizations in
their administrative jurisdictions.\57\ In September 2018, the
MCA released an action plan to monitor the online activities of
groups and mobilize public reporting of illegal activities
online in order to crack down on illegal organizations.\58\ In
May 2019, state-run media outlet Xinhua reported that the MCA
and ``telecom authorities'' shut down the websites and social
media accounts of nine illegal organizations.\59\
Two years after the release of draft revisions to the three
major regulations for civil society organizations,\60\ the MCA
released a new draft regulation for public comment in August
2018, combining the three regulations that form the core of the
regulatory system for domestic social service organizations,
foundations, and social associations into a single regulatory
document.\61\ As of August 2019, however, there were no further
updates on the status of the combined draft regulation.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppression of the LGBTQ Community
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Chinese government continued to suppress the rights of lesbian,
gay, bisexual, transgender, and questioning (LGBTQ) individuals in
China. LGBTQ individuals faced a multitude of challenges, including a
lack of legal protections. The Chinese government cracked down on
organizations and rights defenders active on LGBTQ issues.
Nevertheless, LGBTQ advocates supported online campaigns highlighting
workplace discrimination and sexual harassment, and censorship. The
Chinese government has not followed multiple recommendations from UN
bodies regarding LGBTQ protections.
Civil Society
Continuing Crackdown on Civil Society Undermines LGBTQ
Advocacy. Chinese officials continued censoring online discussion of
topics related to LGBTQ issues and shut down organizations engaging in
advocacy.\62\ These restrictions were a continuation of an official
crackdown on advocacy that began in 2015.\63\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppression of the LGBTQ Community--Continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Blacklisting advocacy organizations and activists. On January
8, 2019, the Guangzhou Municipal Department of Civil Affairs in
Guangdong province issued a list of suspected ``illegal social
organizations,'' naming two organizations that work on gender and
sexuality issues.\64\ One organization, a student group called the
Guangzhou University Rainbow Group (Guangzhou Gaoxiao Caihong Xiaozu),
reportedly organized discussions about sexuality at their
university.\65\ The other organization, the Guangzhou Gender and
Sexuality Education Center (Guangzhou Xingbie Jiaoyu Zhongxin), worked
on both gender and LGBTQ issues, primarily focusing on combating sexual
harassment and violence.\66\ Founded by Wei Tingting,\67\ the
organization conducted and published a survey in April 2018 on the
prevalence of sexual harassment and assault on Chinese college
campuses.\68\ The group succeeded despite encountering censorship
restrictions for the group's campaign to raise funds for the
survey.\69\ The organization announced on the social media platform
WeChat in December 2018 that it would temporarily cease operations.\70\
The field program coordinator for an international LGBTQ rights
organization called the inclusion of these organizations on the list of
suspected illegal organizations ``a setback for LGBT rights in China.''
\71\ In another example of the shrinking space for LGBTQ advocacy, on
January 11, 2019, authorities in Shenzhen municipality, Guangdong,
administratively detained for three days Cheung Kam Hung, the founder
of a Hong Kong-based organization promoting LGBTQ rights in mainland
China,\72\ accusing him of violating the PRC Law on the Management of
Overseas Non-Governmental Organizations' Activities in Mainland
China.\73\ Cheung told Hong Kong media that he planned to close his
organization in 2019, as he could no longer operate in mainland China
due to the law.\74\
Barriers to individual advocacy of LGBTQ protections from
discrimination have been heightened by the ongoing government crackdown
on rights lawyers and advocacy organizations. LGBTQ individuals rarely
petition for formal redress from discrimination,\75\ in part because
they lack legal protection under Chinese law.\76\ Nevertheless, the
State Department reported the NGOs had some success advocating for
LGBTQ rights ``through specific anti-discrimination cases.'' \77\
Independent public advocacy for LGBTQ rights continued to
find space despite official repression. Organizations focusing on LGBTQ
issues continued to operate this past year,\78\ and in an example of
individual LGBTQ advocacy, two men organized an art project in multiple
cities in China, driving trucks with slogans on the side that
criticized the continued use of conversion therapy in China.\79\
LGBTQ Community Lacks Clear Legal Protection from Domestic Violence
A Chinese official indicated in 2015 that the PRC Anti-Domestic
Violence Law would likely not cover those in same-sex
relationships.\80\ According to the U.S. Department of State, ``the law
does not safeguard same-sex couples.'' \81\ As of August 2019, the
Commission did not observe any other national statistics regarding
violence against LGBTQ individuals in the reporting year.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Suppression of the LGBTQ Community--Continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Censorship of LGBTQ Content
Chinese authorities censored LGBTQ content on television, film, and
online, and in some cases prevented public forms of LGBTQ
expression.\82\ In October 2018, authorities in Wuhu municipality,
Anhui province, sentenced an author to ten years and six months'
imprisonment on pornography charges for writing a novel depicting gay
sex.\83\ In April 2019, Chinese social media platforms variously banned
a hashtag for lesbian issues and the use of rainbow flag emojis in
display names.\84\ In response to significant online criticism, the
microblogging platform Weibo restored the hashtag.\85\
UN Recommendations to the Chinese Government on LGBTQ Issues
The Chinese government has not followed a UN Committee
against Torture recommendation made specifically to China to ban its
particular practice of conversion therapy and other ``forced,
involuntary or otherwise coercive or abusive treatments.'' Conversion
therapy, as practiced in Chinese medical facilities, does not meet the
medical standard of ``free and informed consent,'' according to Human
Rights Watch. Moreover, such therapy often includes forced medication,
the involuntary or coercive application of electric shocks, arbitrary
confinement, as well as aversion therapy.\86\ One non-governmental
organization (NGO) focusing on LGBTQ issues documented 169 alleged
cases of forced conversion therapy in China between 2016 and 2017.\87\
In 2016, the UN Committee against Torture called on the Chinese
government to ``prohibit the practice of so-called `conversion
therapy,' and other forced, involuntary or otherwise coercive or
abusive treatments'' as practiced in Chinese medical facilities.\88\
The Chinese government accepted and supported recommendations
related to LGBTQ rights from UN member states that participated in the
Universal Periodic Review. In March 2019, the Chinese government
accepted recommendations made by Argentina, Chile, France, Mexico, the
Netherlands, and Sweden during the November 2018 session of the
Universal Periodic Review of the Chinese government's human rights
record to ``[p]rohibit all forms of discrimination and violence against
lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex persons,'' and to
``adopt measures, including public policies or laws, which ensure the
enjoyment of the right of every person not to be discriminated against
in any way, including their sexual orientation, religion or ethnic
origin.'' \89\ Although in 2016 over 30 delegates to the National
People's Congress \90\ proposed passage of draft anti-discrimination
legislation that would prohibit discrimination on the basis of gender,
sexual identity, and sexual orientation, the Commission had not
observed further action toward passage of the law as of August
2019.\91\

Findings
China's one-party authoritarian political
system remains out of compliance with international
human rights standards because authorities deprived
citizens of the right to meaningfully participate in
the electoral process and in public affairs in general.
As Chinese Communist Party General Secretary
Xi Jinping continued to promote rule-based governance,
the Party passed a series of rules to formalize the
manner and extent of the Party's control over the
government and society. These rules reinforced the all-
encompassing authority of the Party and centralized
personal leadership of Xi Jinping. One set of rules
formalized the Party's longstanding control over
``political-legal'' work covering the judiciary, the
procuratorate, public security agencies, national
security agencies, and judicial administration
agencies. The rules focused on protecting the Party's
political security and preserving its absolute control.
Central authorities also issued rules to
regulate personnel management in the government by
requiring civil servants to receive political
indoctrination and by imposing political considerations
as criteria for career advancement. In one instance,
the Party Central Committee issued an opinion
prohibiting officials from expressing views
inconsistent with the Party's policy or ``improperly
discussing'' central Party policy even outside of work
hours.
While the Chinese government used technology
to facilitate citizens' access to public services, it
continued to employ a combination of ``big data,
artificial intelligence, recognition technology and
other police techniques'' to impose social and
political control. Data collection became more
centralized and coordinated, as an increasing number of
province-level jurisdictions have established ``Big
Data Bureaus.'' In particular, authorities in the
Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region used apps to track
and target Uyghurs and Turkic Muslims for
investigation, which often would result in the
detention of the targeted individuals for non-criminal
conduct.
Citizens' opportunities to participate in
limited local elections diminished this past year.
Chinese authorities reduced the frequency of elections
for grassroots-level committees--from once every three
years to once every five years--in order to synchronize
with the terms of the corresponding Party offices,
thereby ``complementing the Party's complete
leadership.''
On the international stage, China
categorically denied accountability for human rights
violations despite evidence of human rights abuse. It
further rejected recommendations to cease the practice
of arbitrary detention and rejected calls to release
political prisoners. Domestically, the Party and the
government continued to carry out an anticorruption
campaign, resulting in the discipline or criminal
prosecution of some officials on corruption-related
charges. Outside of the anti-corruption campaign, some
courts awarded compensation to victims who were
tortured by government officials, but reporting
indicated that officials sometimes failed to hold
perpetrators accountable.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Support U.S. research programs that document and
analyze the governing institutions and ideological
campaigns of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as
its influence over companies, government agencies,
legislative and judicial bodies, and non-governmental
organizations (NGOs).
Employ a ``whole-of-government'' approach to
encourage Chinese authorities to ratify the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
and release individuals detained or imprisoned for
exercising their rights to freedom of speech,
association, and assembly. These individuals include
those mentioned in this report and in the Commission's
Political Prisoner Database, such as Huang Qi, Liu
Feiyue, and Qin Yongmin.
Support joint U.S.-China cooperative programs to
develop independent village committee and people's
congress election monitoring systems. Encourage central
and local Party and government leaders to implement
free and fair elections across China. Continue to fund,
monitor, and evaluate the effectiveness of democracy
promotion and rule of law programs in China.
Support organizations working in China that seek to
work with local governments and NGOs to improve
transparency, especially with regard to efforts to
expand and improve China's open government information
initiatives. Urge Party officials to further increase
the transparency of Party affairs.
Call on the Chinese government to improve procedures
through which citizens may hold their officials
accountable outside of the internal Party-led
anticorruption campaign. Urge Party and government
officials to establish and improve public participation
in government affairs. Encourage top-level officials to
reform governing institutions to promote an authentic
multi-party system with protections for freedom of
speech, association, and assembly.

Governance in China's One-Party System
China's one-party authoritarian political system remains
out of compliance with the standards defined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) \1\ and the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),\2\ which China
has signed and declared an intention to ratify.\3\ These
standards require that citizens be allowed to freely choose
their representatives \4\ and to hold their officials
accountable through fair and impartial elections regardless of
political party membership.\5\ During the 2019 reporting year,
the Commission observed reports of authorities depriving
citizens of the right to meaningfully participate in the
electoral process and in public affairs in general.
The Chinese Communist Party further curtailed the limited
space for democratic participation as it moved to further
formalize and tighten its control over government and social
institutions.\6\ Echoing language used at the 19th National
Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2017,\7\ official
media continued to emphasize complete dominance of the
Party,\8\ which in turn remained subject to the personal
leadership of President and Party General Secretary Xi
Jinping.\9\
Communist Party Centralized and Expanded Control
The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee asserted the
Party's control in the Opinion on Strengthening Party Political
Building, issued in January 2019.\10\ The opinion demanded
absolute loyalty from leading cadres and emphasized the
importance of protecting the Party's leadership with Xi Jinping
as the core leader and of adhering to ``Xi Jinping Thought on
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era,'' \11\
which is a political ideology incorporated into China's
Constitution in 2018.\12\
Beyond reaffirming the Party's authority in the opinion,
the Central Committee issued substantive rules that had the
effect of centralizing and expanding the Party's control. The
Regulations on the Chinese Communist Party's Political-Legal
Work, for example, institutionalized the Party's longstanding
de facto control over ``political-legal work'' (zhengfa
gongzuo) \13\ which covers the judiciary, the procuratorate,
public security agencies, national security agencies, and
judicial administration agencies.\14\ The regulations invoked
the authority of both the Party Constitution as well as China's
Constitution,\15\ and it was the first time that the Party
described its political-legal functions by way of Party
rules.\16\ The regulations repeatedly emphasized the Party's
absolute control and tasked political-legal committees with
devising strategies to ensure political security and social
stability.\17\ A U.S.-based scholar and former rights lawyer in
China observed that the Party used the regulations as a way to
assert the Party's control and to forestall attempts to promote
division of political power or judicial independence.\18\
The Regulations on Requesting Instructions and Making
Reports on Important Issues, effective in January 2019,
established a command structure with Xi Jinping at the core,
requiring local Party entities to obtain approval or guidance
from a higher-ranking Party entity for ten categories of
``important matters,'' such as those necessitating policy
changes.\19\ Also, the provisional Regulations on Chinese
Communist Party Branch Operations, effective in October 2018,
expanded the Party's reach in society \20\ by requiring the
establishment of Party branches or joint Party branches in
rural cooperatives and commercial organizations to promote
Party policies.\21\ These provisional regulations were
promulgated after the Party amended its Constitution in 2017 in
part to delineate the nature and functions of Party branches,
which previously were not governed by written rules.\22\
Communist Party Formalized Control Over Personnel Management in
Government
Central Party authorities further strengthened the Party's
control over civil servants and Party-government leadership
positions. In November 2018, the Chinese Communist Party
Central Committee issued a plan requiring personnel in
leadership positions to be trained at facilities \23\ such as
the new Central Party School (Chinese Academy of Governance), a
Party entity established in March 2018 to take over the
function of training government officials.\24\ The plan covers
seven categories of personnel, including Party-government
leaders, civil servants, and leaders of enterprises and public
institutions.\25\ A minimum of 70 percent of the training at
Party schools must center on ``Xi Jinping Thought.'' \26\
In December 2018, the National People's Congress Standing
Committee revised the PRC Civil Servant Law to require every
civil servant to support and obey the Party's leadership,\27\
an addition to the existing provisions for compliance with the
constitution and the law.\28\ The Standing Committee also added
political considerations as criteria for training, examination,
appointment, and supervision of civil servants.\29\ Under the
revised law, civil servants are prohibited from disseminating
speech harmful to the Party's reputation, ``damaging ethnic
relations,'' or ``joining activities that divide ethnic
groups.'' \30\ Previously, authorities prosecuted citizens on
the charge of ``inciting ethnic hatred'' for peacefully
expressing views on the government's ethnic policies.\31\
Furthermore, the Opinion on Strengthening and Improving Party
Building in Central Authority and Government Agencies, issued
in March 2019, prohibited officials from expressing views
inconsistent with the Party's policy or ``improperly
discussing'' central Party policy (wangyi zhongyang) even
outside of work hours.\32\ According to one scholar's analysis,
the political assessment requirement under the revised PRC
Civil Servant Law may negatively impact non-governmental
organization (NGO) operations in China, as officials try to
demonstrate political loyalty by interacting with NGOs in ways
that are consistent with the Party's policy of limiting the
scope of public interest activities.\33\
In March 2019, the Party issued Regulations on Selection
and Appointment of Party and Government Leading Cadres \34\ to
``steadfastly prioritize political standards.'' \35\ The
regulations require that all cadres holding leadership
positions in the government or the Party must ``resolutely
safeguard General Secretary Xi Jinping's core leadership and
uphold the centralized and unified leadership of the Central
Committee.'' \36\ The new regulations supersede the 2014
version, which lacks specific reference to Xi Jinping.\37\
Some observers claimed that centralization and tightening
of control has stalled democratic progress and political reform
\38\ and could result in the implementation of policies that
are insensitive to local conditions.\39\ A Germany-based
scholar estimated that ``the number of provincial
experiments''--such as initiatives for building free markets
and allowing private land ownership--``fell from 500 in 2010 to
about 70 in 2016.'' \40\ According to some Chinese officials,
emphasis on loyalty and ``political performance'' had led civil
servants to become increasingly reluctant to act independently
and had caused many to leave their jobs.\41\
Use of Technology to Control Citizens
While the Chinese government used technology to facilitate
citizens' access to public services,\42\ it continued to employ
a combination of ``big data, artificial intelligence,
recognition technology and other police techniques'' to impose
social and political control.\43\
SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGY
The Chinese government demonstrated its technological
capacity \44\ to implement advanced surveillance systems. For
example, authorities installed facial recognition systems at
sites with a high volume of human traffic, such as at an
airport in Shanghai municipality,\45\ four subway stations in
Guangzhou municipality, Guangdong province,\46\ and the border
crossing of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge.\47\ Despite
having the potential to speed up the security screening
process,\48\ the technology has raised privacy concerns.\49\
Examples of surveillance systems implemented during this
reporting year, including those that emerged from the Xinjiang
Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR), demonstrate that the Chinese
government has a policy of using technology for repression.\50\
One official who worked in a mass internment camp in the XUAR
said that authorities could constantly monitor each room
through a system of surveillance cameras, which they used to
control detainees' activities including bathroom usage.\51\ In
another example, authorities required members of a government-
sanctioned Christian church in the XUAR to verify their
identity and go through a facial recognition system, which
effectively prevented some of them from participating in the
church service due to the time involved in being processed.\52\
In May 2019, non-governmental organization (NGO) Human Rights
Watch released a report in which it documented Chinese
authorities' use of apps as part of the ``Integrated Joint
Operations Platforms'' to track and target Uyghurs and other
Turkic Muslims for investigation, which often resulted in the
detention of the targeted individuals for non-criminal
conduct.\53\ [For more information on surveillance practices in
the XUAR, see Section II--Business and Human Rights and Section
IV--Xinjiang.]
PROVINCES CREATED BIG DATA ADMINISTRATION BUREAUS
Authorities' efforts to collect information became more
coordinated and centralized this past year. Following the
restructuring of central government agencies in March 2018,\54\
local governments also underwent reorganization,\55\ with a
number of them creating new provincial- and prefectural-level
bureaus designed to manage big data,\56\ adding to the existing
21 similar agencies.\57\ These bureaus, seen as instrumental to
building smart cities,\58\ are tasked with coordinating data
collection and sharing among different government agencies to
improve transparency and the capacity of governance.\59\ While
big data bureaus have the potential to improve citizens' access
to government services,\60\ observers noted the lack of
adequate privacy protection and expressed concerns that these
bureaus can serve as the Chinese government's instrument of
surveillance.\61\
In one example, a plan issued by a local government in
Henan province indicated that the provincial government was
gathering, auditing, and entering information of religious
followers into a database, according to an online magazine
focusing on religious freedom in China.\62\ The database--
called the ``Henan Province Religious Affairs Management and
Service Platform''--began operation in May 2018,\63\ and the
data-gathering efforts may be part of the ideological
``rectification measures'' issued by the Henan Provincial Party
Committee around September 2018.\64\ Some religious
practitioners expressed concern that databases like this one
would facilitate ``the Chinese Communist government to carry
out further monitoring, restriction, or even crack down'' on
religious followers.\65\
In August 2018, China Digital Times reposted an online
article by an anonymous source claiming to be an experienced
public security official who disclosed the manner in which
authorities categorized individuals using information collected
through big data systems.\66\ Targeted people included Uyghurs
in the XUAR, Tibetans returning from abroad, Falun Gong
practitioners, veterans, NGO workers, and foreign
journalists.\67\ The source also provided photographs of
computer screens suggesting that public security officials not
only collect biographical information, but they also track
travel and internet usage history and have the ability to link
records of a person's neighbors, relatives, and people
traveling on the same airplane.\68\ The original article has
since become unavailable.
Citizen Participation
SUPPRESSION OF POLITICALLY SENSITIVE ACTIVITIES
While the official Party news outlet People's Daily
continued to operate a message board through which local
officials may respond to citizens' complaints and suggestions
on issues concerning personal matters and local policies,
political content posted on the board was subject to
censorship.\69\ Beyond the officially maintained platform,
authorities criminally detained people who engaged in speech or
advocacy work that had broader social and political
implications: In one example, authorities in Shenzhen
municipality, Guangdong province, detained Wei Zhili in March
2019 on suspicion of ``picking quarrels and provoking trouble''
in connection to his online advocacy for factory workers who
contracted pneumoconiosis due to the lack of occupational
safety measures.\70\ In another example, authorities in
Xinxiang municipality, Henan province, arrested He Fangmei in
April 2019 on suspicion of ``picking quarrels and provoking
trouble'' because she protested and organized a support group
for parents with children who were rendered disabled or
paralyzed after receiving substandard vaccines.\71\ [For more
information on Chinese authorities' use of the criminal justice
system and extralegal measures to suppress rights activities,
see Section II--Criminal Justice.]
ELECTIONS
The Commission did not observe progress in expanding the
scope of direct elections, which Chinese law limits to people's
congresses of local jurisdictions \72\ and grassroots-level
committees.\73\ In December 2018, the National People's
Congress Standing Committee amended two sets of laws to
decrease the frequency of grassroots-level elections from once
every three years to once every five years, affecting elections
for village committees in rural areas and residents committees
in urban areas.\74\ The new five-year term of office for these
committees synchronized with the term of Party committees at
the corresponding levels specified in a Party opinion issued
earlier in July 2018.\75\ According to an official news
article, the longer term would be beneficial to implementing
policy plans and improving stability,\76\ and Minister of Civil
Affairs Huang Shuxian said the change would complement the
Party's complete leadership.\77\
Rights Defense Network, a human rights monitoring group,
documented instances in which officials suppressed meaningful
participation in or speech regarding elections this past
year,\78\ demonstrating that China's political institutions do
not meet the standards for elections outlined in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights \79\ and the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights.\80\ For example, in September
2018, officials in Qianshan county, Anqing municipality, Anhui
province, disqualified two candidates who, in a preselection,
were leading or in close contest with another two candidates
selected by the township Party committee.\81\ The township
leaders also reportedly hired a known gang member to physically
assault individuals who opposed the selected candidates.\82\
Accountability
CHINA DENIED COMMITTING HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS
In international forums, China categorically denied that it
had committed human rights violations. As Xi Jinping's
political ideology continued to guide China's human rights
practices,\83\ the spokesperson of China's Ministry of Foreign
Affairs in August 2018 dismissed as baseless \84\ reports of
Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities being held in incommunicado
detention, as noted in the concluding observations of the UN
Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.\85\
After the Universal Periodic Review held in November 2018,
China likewise asserted that ``[t]here is no such problem as
arbitrary detention,'' in response to multiple calls by UN
members for China to cease all forms of arbitrary detention,
including mass internment camps in the XUAR.\86\ China also
rejected recommendations to cease the persecution of human
rights defenders and lawyers,\87\ claiming that requests to
release those detained ``in accordance with law is an
interference in China's judicial sovereignty.'' \88\
ANTICORRUPTION CAMPAIGN
Domestically, Chinese authorities continued to carry out
the anticorruption campaign,\89\ which began in 2012 with the
stated goals of restoring Party discipline and punishing
official corruption and is viewed as Xi Jinping's signature
initiative.\90\ According to some observers, the campaign may
not be effective in combating corruption because it does not
strengthen institutional supervision such as by the press,
civil society, and other political parties.\91\
The National Supervisory Commission (NSC)--an
anticorruption body created in March 2018 with authority to
detain people without judicial oversight \92\--has demonstrated
thus far that its operations were subordinate only to the
Chinese Communist Party. Director Yang Xiaodu of the NSC said
in February 2019 that the commission was supervised by the
Party Central Committee and therefore would not release a
report separate from the one issued by the Central Commission
for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), a Party entity.\93\ In
January, the CCDI issued its work report internally and
addressed it to CCDI's own standing committee at a plenary
meeting.\94\ The NSC did not submit a separate work report to
the National People's Congress (NPC) in March 2019 during the
annual meetings, although the law subjects supervisory
commissions to the oversight of the corresponding people's
congresses.\95\
Furthermore, while the NSC hired its first cohort of
``special supervisors'' in December 2018 with the stated
purpose of improving supervision by the public,\96\ these
supervisors are required to submit themselves to the Party's
leadership, and their duties do not go beyond making
suggestions and promoting the Party's policies.\97\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Possible Political Motivations Behind Detaining Interpol President
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Among those detained as part of the anticorruption campaign was Meng
Hongwei,\98\ who was Vice Minister of Public Security when he was
elected in November 2016 to lead the International Criminal Police
Organization (Interpol), the international police agency headquartered
in Lyon, France.\99\ Meng disappeared upon arriving in China on a trip
from France in October 2018, according to his wife.\100\ In March 2019,
the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI) and the
National Supervisory Commission (NSC) expelled Meng from the Party and
stripped him of his official position for a number of alleged
wrongdoings, including abusing his power, not adhering to Party rules,
and receiving bribes; the article did not detail any specific act,
however.\101\ In addition, the article reported that Meng lacked
``Party spirit'' and refused to carry out orders from the Party's
Central Committee.\102\ Meng's wife maintained that the detention was
politically motivated, adding that Meng ``was well-known in China for
his reformist views and had in March 2017 tendered his resignation to
the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.'' \103\ Sources
told the Wall Street Journal that Meng, in his capacity as the head of
the international police agency, did not fully carry out Chinese
central authorities' instructions to issue ``red notices,'' which would
help them target dissidents outside of China.\104\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CASES OUTSIDE THE ANTICORRUPTION CAMPAIGN
In some examples, Chinese authorities displayed a
willingness to hold officials accountable outside the
anticorruption campaign in cases involving official
malfeasance:
In October 2018, the Tianjin Municipal No. 1
Intermediate Court sentenced nine former procuratorate
officials from Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture,
Jilin province, to terms of imprisonment ranging from 1
year and 3 months to 13 years on charges including
``intentional assault,'' ``extorting confession by
torture,'' and ``dereliction of duty,'' after they
tortured and caused the death of a Hong Kong
businessman during an interrogation that lasted over
four days.\105\
In November 2018, the public security bureau
in Quanzhou municipality, Fujian province, issued an
apology and suspended one officer for harassing a
female journalist who was reporting on a biochemical
leakage incident in that locality.\106\ The article
reporting the event characterized the government's
response as rare, however.\107\
In contrast, other examples showed a lack of commitment to
hold officials accountable:
In November 2018, the Shandong Province
People's Government appointed Ma Yuenan as the director
of the provincial Big Data Bureau,\108\ one month after
she was reprimanded for failing to prevent the
distribution of substandard vaccines in Shandong.\109\
The appointment reportedly violated a Party rule that
prohibits the promotion or appointment of a Party
member to an important post within six months of a
reprimand.\110\
In January 2019, the Liaoyuan Municipal
Intermediate People's Court in Jilin province awarded
compensation to an individual who served over 25 years
in prison for a homicide conviction based on
confessions reportedly extracted through torture.\111\
Yet neither the court that awarded him compensation nor
the court that reversed his conviction found that
torture took place, and sources did not indicate that
authorities had held the perpetrators accountable.\112\

Findings
Under the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR), all persons are entitled to
equal treatment in the course of seeking enforceable
legal remedies within the legal system for violations
of their rights. During the 2019 reporting year, the
Commission observed examples in which Chinese
authorities violated the right to equal treament by
influencing the judiciary, controlling the legal
profession, and persecuting human rights lawyers, all
of which are inconsistent with the relevant ICCPR
provisions.
The Chinese Communist Party issued regulations
to formalize its control over the judiciary through
political-legal work committees, which are Party
entities. In January 2019, the Central Political-Legal
Committee led an investigation into a case involving
allegations that Supreme People's Court President Zhou
Qiang interfered with the adjudication of a case. The
investigation's conclusion was based on a possibly
coerced confession and did not address Zhou's
involvement.
The Party's absolute leadership over the
judiciary, as promoted by official media, had a
negative impact on the overall judicial process. The
Supreme People's Court planned to amend past judicial
interpretations to conform to approved political
ideology and announced that it would not issue any new
judicial interpretations unless the topic was specified
by the Party. With respect to the legal profession, the
Minister of Justice urged lawyers to ``unify their
thoughts'' and to accept the Party's complete
leadership over their work.
Authorities continued to criminally prosecute
human rights lawyers on charges such as ``subversion of
state power,'' viewing legal representation provided by
them as a threat to the Party's political security.
Authorities also restricted the speech and movement of
human rights lawyers, and in some cases stripped them
of their law licenses.
Citizens continued to use the petitioning
system as a channel to express their grievances, but
the system's opacity made the effectiveness of their
efforts difficult to determine. Some local governments
answered calls from central authorities to improve
data-sharing capability with anticorruption agencies to
better monitor conduct of local officials, suggesting a
new focus for the petitioning system.
The Ministry of Justice announced changes to
the legal aid system to standardize services, including
the prompt assignment of and compensation for legal aid
workers. Acting jointly with the Supreme People's
Court, the Ministry of Justice also expanded a legal
aid service pilot program for criminal cases to cover
more locations. These new developments do not appear to
expand the space for civil society groups to provide
public interest legal aid services, and authorities
banned a group formed to provide legal aid and
consultation.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Highlight and discuss with Chinese officials the
report in which the UN Working Group on Arbitrary
Detention found human rights lawyers Wang Quanzhang,
Jiang Tianyong, Li Yuhan, and Yu Wensheng to have been
arbitrarily detained. Urge the Chinese government to
unconditionally exonerate the above-named lawyers and
other similarly situated lawyers.
Highlight and discuss with Chinese officials cases of
human rights lawyers such as Sui Muqing, Tan Yongpei,
Liu Zhengqing, Xie Yanyi, and Chen Keyun, whose law
licenses were revoked or whose ability to practice law
was otherwise restricted because of their legal
representation and advocacy in cases that Chinese
authorities deem politically sensitive.
Urge the Chinese government to protect the
fundamental civil and professional rights of China's
lawyers, to investigate all allegations of abuse
against them, and to ensure that those responsible are
brought to justice. Urge the Chinese government to end
all forms of harassment or persecution against the
family members of human rights lawyers and advocates,
including surveillance and restrictions on their
freedom of movement.
Urge the Chinese government to stop all forms of
persecution or prosecution of petitioners who use the
petitioning system to peacefully seek redress for their
grievances.
Urge leaders of the Chinese Communist Party and
government to grant the judiciary true independence and
warn them of the negative impact on the rule of law
when the judiciary is involved in political campaigns.
Increase support for programs that promote dialogue
between U.S. and Chinese legal experts to determine how
China can structure and implement legal reforms.
Concomitantly increase support for collaboration
between U.S. and Chinese academic and non-governmental
entities to help develop programs that enhance the
capacity of the Chinese legal system to protect
citizens' rights.
Access to
Justice

Access to Justice
The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights
(ICCPR), which China signed and expressed its intention to
ratify,\1\ provides that all persons are equal before the
courts; it also obligates a State Party to ensure that people
have enforceable legal remedies for any violation of the rights
and freedoms recognized in the convention, even if the
violation has been committed by an official.\2\
Although Supreme People's Court President Zhou Qiang
reported improvements in different aspects of the judicial
system,\3\ the examples of political interference with the
judiciary, control over the legal profession, and persecution
of human rights lawyers that the Commission observed during the
2019 reporting year are inconsistent with the relevant ICCPR
provisions.
Communist Party's Control Over the Judicial Process
COMMUNIST PARTY EXERTS CONTROL THROUGH POLITICAL-LEGAL COMMITTEES
The Chinese Communist Party Central Committee issued
Regulations on the Chinese Communist Party's Political-Legal
Work, effective in January 2019, to formalize its control over
a range of state functions, including the judiciary.\4\ Under
the regulations, Party-run political-legal committees at the
central and provincial levels are tasked with promoting
judicial transparency, as well as reporting instances of
judicial interference by cadres in leadership positions.\5\
According to an official interpretation of the new regulations,
political-legal committees are responsible for setting general
directions and policies but are not authorized to manage
substantive work in individual cases.\6\ In practice, however,
political-legal committees have a record of influencing
individual cases.\7\
In March 2018, Central Party authorities expanded the scope
of the Central Political-Legal Committee's \8\ jurisdiction to
domestic public security concerns,\9\ including integrated
``social order management,'' ``social stability maintenance,''
and prevention and handling of ``cult'' issues,\10\ which have
been the bases for prosecuting citizens in connection to their
legitimate and peaceful exercise of internationally recognized
human rights.\11\ [For more information on Chinese authorities'
use of criminal provisions to suppress religion and human
rights activities, see Section II--Criminal Justice and Freedom
of Religion.]
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Judicial Interference and Party-Led Investigation
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In January 2019, the Central Political-Legal Committee led an
investigation into a case involving allegations of judicial
interference, including those involving the Supreme People's Court
(SPC) President Zhou Qiang. According to Radio Free Asia, some lawyers
pointed out that the Central Political-Legal Committee lacks
constitutional authority to investigate the Supreme People's Court
since such authority lies with the National People's Congress.\12\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Judicial Interference and Party-Led Investigation--Continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The subject of the investigation was a case that commenced in 2006,
when entrepreneur Zhao Faqi's company sued a state-owned enterprise
over a contract dispute concerning mining rights in Shaanxi
province.\13\ Despite initial success, Zhao's company lost on appeal,
and the case twice came before the SPC.\14\ In November 2016, Zhao Faqi
published an open letter in which he alleged that several high-ranking
officials in Shaanxi had intervened in the judicial process and thereby
affected the disposition of the case.\15\
Beginning in December 2018, Wang Linqing, a former SPC judge who
handled the case, released several pre-recorded video clips and
confirmed unofficial information \16\ that the case file had gone
missing since 2016.\17\ Wang further recounted that an SPC leader--whom
another source identified as SPC President Zhou Qiang--gave him two
sets of instructions through another court official, initially to
remand the case, and later to dismiss the appeal, which would have had
the effect of reversing the collegial panel's decision \18\ to rule in
favor of Zhao's company.\19\ In February 2019, official media outlet
China Central Television broadcasted a recording showing Wang admitting
to stealing the file himself ostensibly in order to prevent the case
from being transferred away, given the amount of time he had spent
working on it.\20\
The Party-led investigation team found that the SPC's case file
security measures were defective and that the adjudication process was
delayed beyond the statutory timeframe.\21\ The team, however, did not
make a finding specific to the alleged involvement of Zhou Qiang.\22\
Zhou promptly expressed support for the investigation results, as
reported in an editorial in the People's Court Daily entitled
``Upholding the Party's Absolute Leadership over the Work of People's
Courts.'' \23\ Observers questioned the voluntariness of Wang Linqing's
recorded confession and the credibility of the investigation.\24\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
FIVE-YEAR PLAN TO CONFORM JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS TO PARTY VALUES
Following a Chinese Communist Party directive,\25\ the
Supreme People's Court (SPC) in September 2018 issued a five-
year plan requiring that the selection, drafting, and amendment
of judicial interpretations must conform to ``socialist core
values'' \26\ as guided by the political ideology of Party
General Secretary and President Xi Jinping.\27\ While the full
text of the plan was not publicly available,\28\ the head of
the SPC Research Office explained that the SPC planned to
revisit existing judicial interpretations and amend portions
that were in conflict with socialist core values, with an
intention to incorporate the ideological aims of socialist core
values into judicial adjudication standards.\29\ He also said
that the SPC in principle would not issue new judicial
interpretations in the next five years unless the topic was
specifically listed in the five-year plan.\30\
CONTROL OF THE LEGAL PROFESSION
In September 2018, the Ministry of Justice convened a
meeting about Party-building in the legal profession
nationwide,\31\ echoing a provision in the Measures on Managing
Law Firms that requires law firms to engage in Party-
building.\32\ ``Party-building'' encompasses a range of
activities such as improving the Party's organizational
structure, as well as Party members' discipline and their
ideological commitment.\33\ At the meeting, Minister of Justice
Fu Zhenghua urged attendees to further ``unify [their]
thoughts'' and to ``unabashedly support the Party's complete
leadership over lawyers' work.'' \34\ The meeting specified
that Party-building work must be a priority within the entire
legal profession by 2020.\35\ In May 2019, three non-
governmental organizations submitted a joint analysis to the UN
Special Rapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers,
in which they observed that recent administrative measures
imposed on lawyers and law firms facilitated political
interference by granting authorities ``the power to deny,
temporarily or indefinitely, the right to practice to lawyers
without reasonable and effective avenues for appeal.'' \36\
Persecution of Human Rights Lawyers
Chinese authorities continued to persecute human rights
lawyers, including Wang Quanzhang, Jiang Tianyong, Li Yuhan,
and Yu Wensheng, whom the UN Working Group on Arbitrary
Detention (Working Group) found to have been detained for their
rights defense work, in contravention of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights.\37\ The Working Group requested
that the Chinese government immediately release the
lawyers.\38\ Chinese authorities, however, continued to subject
them to criminal prosecution and penalty.
In January 2019, the Tianjin No. 2 Intermediate People's
Court sentenced Wang Quanzhang to four years and six months in
prison for ``subversion of state power.'' \39\ In June 2019,
authorities permitted Wang's wife Li Wenzu to visit him for the
first time in nearly four years.\40\ Li reported that Wang had
lost a significant amount of weight, exhibited robotic
reactions and hazy memory, and was reading from a piece of
paper when he asked her not to visit him anymore.\41\ In
February 2019, authorities extralegally detained Jiang Tianyong
upon completion of his two-year prison term for ``inciting
subversion of state power.'' \42\ Authorities eventually
permitted Jiang to return home but continued to subject him to
strict surveillance,\43\ a measure not provided for in the PRC
Criminal Procedure Law.\44\ Jiang's wife reported that
authorities tortured Jiang and that he suffered from depression
and significant memory loss.\45\ In April 2019, Li Yuhan's
lawyers reported that Li's health had deteriorated further at a
detention center in Shenyang municipality, Liaoning province,
and that the court had postponed a scheduled trial without
giving them notice.\46\
As of March 2019, authorities continued to hold Yu Wensheng
in pretrial detention for over a year and deny him legal
representation by lawyers hired by his family.\47\ Yu's wife Xu
Yan reported that in March over 10 public security officials
and residential committee personnel were stationed outside her
residence and prevented her from leaving.\48\ Xu previously
filed an administrative review and an administrative appeal
over the public security bureau's rejection of clothing that
she had sent to her husband in detention.\49\
Besides criminal prosecution, Chinese authorities used
other methods to persecute human rights lawyers, including
revoking their law licenses,\50\ placing obstacles in the
license renewal process,\51\ and restricting their freedom of
speech \52\ and movement.\53\ In one example, police physically
assaulted a lawyer when she was performing her duties as a
criminal defense lawyer: \54\
Sun Shihua. In September 2018, lawyer Sun, the
wife of human rights lawyer Sui Muqing,\55\ went to a
police station in Guangzhou municipality, Guangdong
province, in connection with her client's criminal
case.\56\ An officer surnamed Chen reportedly declined
to discuss Sun's client's case with her and accused Sun
of attacking him.\57\ A group of officers then gathered
and beat Sun, during which time Officer Chen choked her
and rendered her unconscious.\58\ Officers then ordered
Sun to take off her clothes and provide a urine
sample.\59\ During Sun's six-hour long detention,
officers also reportedly ordered her client to strip
naked.\60\ The Guangzhou Public Security Bureau said it
investigated the incident and concluded that the
officers ``had a rigid attitude and acted uncivilly,''
but it denied physical assault or insult having taken
place.\61\ While at the police station, Sun overheard
two officers saying to each other that someone had
asked the police station to ``handle her case.'' \62\
Citizen Petitioning
The petitioning system (xinfang), also known as the
``letters and visits system,'' has been a popular mechanism
outside of the formal legal system for citizens to present
their grievances to authorities, either in writing or in
person.\63\ The petitioning system reportedly has been
ineffective in addressing citizens' grievances due to factors
such as the large number of petitions,\64\ staff shortages,\65\
officials' fraudulent use of data,\66\ and corruption.\67\
Although the director of the National Public Complaints and
Proposals Administration said that the petitioning system was
highly efficient and had a public satisfaction rate of over 95
percent,\68\ such claims remained unverifiable due to a lack of
transparency. A group of 57 petitioners from Shanghai
municipality previously asked the government to release
information to verify a similar claim made in 2016.\69\ The
Shanghai government called the information ``state secrets''
and refused to disclose it.\70\ The petitioners then sought
administrative review with the State Council, which had not
provided them with a response as of October 2018,\71\ far
exceeding the statutory 90-day case processing time limit.\72\
This past year, some local governments focused their
efforts on enhancing the petitioning system's capability to
collect data for anticorruption agencies.\73\ For example, an
official news outlet reported that officials in Beijing
municipality created a system by which they would make
appointments with petitioners to individually hear complaints
concerning significant misconduct.\74\ In Guizhou province,
officials developed a system to sort through this type of
complaint and set case completion time limits.\75\
During this reporting year, petitioners continued to face
official repression. Authorities detained petitioners, alleging
criminal or administrative offenses including ``disrupting
order in a public place,'' \76\ ``picking quarrels and
provoking trouble,'' \77\ and ``obstructing official
business.'' \78\ In addition, authorities reportedly detained
petitioners in the period leading up to and during the annual
meetings of the National People's Congress and Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference in March 2019.\79\
Legal Aid
The legal aid system remained a state-controlled
institution. State Council regulations require that justice
bureaus of local governments appoint legal aid organizations
and administer legal aid programs through them.\80\ Legal aid
organizations may assign eligible applicants to in-house
lawyers or make referrals to law firms, grassroots legal
services, or other social organizations.\81\ Lawyers are
legally obligated to provide legal aid services and may be
disciplined or fined for refusing to do so.\82\
This past year, authorities expanded and standardized legal
aid services across China. In January 2019, the Supreme
People's Court and the Ministry of Justice expanded a legal aid
pilot program from 8 locations to 31.\83\ The pilot program
required authorities to advise unrepresented criminal
defendants of their right to legal counsel; it also required
better coordination between courts, procuratorates, public
security bureaus, justice bureaus, and legal aid offices to
improve allocation of legal aid resources.\84\
Following this, the Ministry of Justice in February 2019
issued a document to standardize legal aid services in criminal
cases, covering different stages of a criminal case, from
pretrial investigation to appellate work.\85\ Around the same
time, the Ministry of Justice and Ministry of Finance issued a
guiding opinion delineating specific standards for setting the
amount of compensation for legal aid workers and lawyers in
administrative, civil, and criminal cases.\86\
These documents, however, do not contain provisions for
legal aid services provided by civil society groups operating
outside the officially sanctioned framework. In at least one
instance, authorities banned one such group and effectively
shut down its operations.\87\ In September 2018, several rights
lawyers who lost their law licenses after a crackdown in 2015
formed a public interest group based in Nanning municipality,
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, to provide legal aid and
consultation services.\88\ In January 2019, authorities in
Nanning banned the group, alleging that it operated in
violation of the Regulations on the Registration and Management
of Social Organizations.\89\
Other Developments in the Judicial System
Parallel to the repressive campaign against rights lawyers
and advocates, Chinese authorities continued to carry out ``the
most systematic and structural legal reform, unprecedented
since Chinese reform started 40 years ago,'' as observed by a
Hong Kong-based scholar.\90\
Supreme People's Court President Zhou Qiang
reported an increase in the number of successfully
resolved enforcement cases in the past three years,\91\
thereby accomplishing a goal set at the Fourth Plenum
of the 18th Chinese Communist Party Central Committee
held in November 2014.\92\ In January 2019, however,
the U.S. Department of State cautioned that Chinese
authorities could prohibit U.S. citizens from leaving
China in order to compel them to resolve civil disputes
in favor of Chinese parties.\93\
Court officials used technology to make it
more convenient for citizens to access the court
system, such as developing online case opening systems
and promoting mobile courts housed in vehicles.\94\
In October 2018, the National People's
Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) revised the PRC
Organic Law of People's Courts, which codified certain
judicial reforms in the past 40 years, including the
establishment of specialized courts, a judicial
responsibility system, and a judge quota system.\95\
In April 2019, the NPCSC revised the PRC
Judges Law to codify the selection and review process
for judges.\96\ The revised law also added the
requirement to support the Party's leadership and the
socialist system.\97\

Xinjiang
Xinjiang
IV. Xinjiang
Findings
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year,
authorities in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region
(XUAR) expanded a system of extrajudicial mass
internment camps in which they continued to arbitrarily
detain Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui, and others.
Security personnel at the camps subjected detainees to
torture, including beatings; electric shocks;
waterboarding; medical neglect; forced ingestion of
medication; sleep deprivation; extended solitary
confinement; and handcuffing or shackling for prolonged
periods, as well as restricted access to toilet
facilities; punishment for behavior deemed religious;
forced labor; overcrowding; deprivation of food; and
political indoctrination. Some detainees reportedly
died in camps due to poor conditions, medical neglect,
or other reasons.
Authorities forced some mass internment camp
detainees to engage in labor and forced former
detainees to engage in labor following their release
from camps. According to research published by German
researcher Adrian Zenz in July 2019, authorities began
establishing forced labor programs for camp detainees
and ``graduates'' in the second half of 2018, in
addition to extensive forced labor programs for XUAR
residents not detained in camps.
Scholars and rights groups provided a strong
argument, based on available evidence, that the
``crimes against humanity'' framework may apply to the
case of mass internment camps in the XUAR. Article 7 of
the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court
provides a list of 11 acts that may constitute ``crimes
against humanity'' ``when committed as part of a
widespread or systematic attack directed against any
civilian population, with knowledge of the attack.''
Official Chinese media portrayed revised
regional regulations on extremism as justification for
mass internment camps, but the camps remained illegal
under both Chinese and international law. In October
2018, the XUAR People's Congress revised the region's
first anti-extremism regulations, which were adopted in
March 2017, and official media described the revisions
as a legal basis for ``vocational training centers''
combating ``extremism'' in the XUAR--an apparent
reference to mass internment camps. International legal
scholars and rights advocates stressed that, despite
Chinese officials' attempt to use the revised
regulations to justify mass internment camps, the
revised local legislation did not provide a legal basis
for the camps, particularly because the PRC Law on
Legislation only allows deprivation of personal liberty
under statutes passed by the National People's Congress
or its Standing Committee.
In November 2018, Adrian Zenz published the
findings of research he conducted into budgets for
security expenditures in the XUAR and other regions of
China which showed that ``political reeducation''
carried out in mass internment camps appeared to be
aimed at ``political indoctrination and
intimidation''--refuting Chinese officials' assertions
that the purpose of mass internment camps is to provide
vocational education and employment training. In
October 2018, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that,
based on its analysis of 1,500 publicly available
procurement documents from local governments in the
XUAR, authorities administered mass internment camps in
the same way as prisons. AFP reported that government
departments in charge of administering camps ordered
police uniforms, riot shields and helmets, electrified
batons, cattle prods, billy clubs, spears, handcuffs,
pepper spray, tear gas, tasers, net guns, stun guns,
and spiked clubs known as ``wolf's teeth'' to maintain
control over detainees.
Mass internment camp detainees reportedly
included permanent residents of the United States and
Australia. American officials stated in March 2019 that
Chinese authorities may have detained several American
residents. As of August 2019, Chinese authorities
reportedly detained ten or more Australian residents in
mass internment camps. In addition, at least five
Australian children were reportedly unable to leave the
XUAR due to restrictions on the freedom of movement of
their parents in the XUAR.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Call on the Chinese government to end the mass,
arbitrary detention of predominantly Muslim ethnic
minorities, including Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui,
and others in mass internment camps, and release those
currently detained. Call on Chinese officials to allow
U.S. officials, diplomatic representatives of other
countries, UN officials, humanitarian organizations,
and international journalists to visit the XUAR and
independently investigate reports of arbitrary
detention. Coordinate with other governments and
international non-governmental organizations to compile
relevant information regarding specific XUAR officials
responsible for the arbitrary mass detention and abuse
of individuals in mass internment camps in preparation
for possible sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human
Rights Accountability Act (Public Law No. 114-328).
Support the passage of the Uyghur Human Rights Policy
Act of 2019 (S. 178 and H.R. 649), requiring the
Director of National Intelligence and the State
Department to report on issues including the regional
security threats caused by Chinese government
repression of ethnic minorities in the XUAR, and on the
transfer or development of technologies to facilitate
mass internment and surveillance there; requiring the
Federal Bureau of Investigation to report on topics
such as its efforts to protect ethnic Uyghurs and
Chinese nationals in the U.S. from Chinese government
intimidation, and those whose families in China have
been threatened or detained because of their advocacy
for the Uyghurs; and establishing a position known as
the Special Coordinator for Xinjiang.
Urge U.S. companies selling products, providing
services, conducting business, or investing in
development initiatives in the XUAR to ensure that
their products, services, and investment funds do not
provide support for XUAR officials' arbitrary detention
of ethnic minority individuals or XUAR authorities' use
of technology to otherwise repress and control XUAR
residents, rather than for legitimate law enforcement
activities. Urge the Bureau of Industry and Security at
the U.S. Department of Commerce to track the sale of
equipment and technology used by Chinese security
agencies and U.S. companies' sale of surveillance and
crime control technology to XUAR officials, and
investigate the legality of such sales according to
existing U.S. Export Administration Regulations.
Urge American universities to provide support to
Uyghur, Kazakh, and Kyrgyz students at their
institutions who are Chinese nationals, to ensure they
are able to study in a safe environment free of threats
and intimidation from Chinese government officials; to
provide scholarships or other financial assistance to
students whose parents or guardians have been detained
in mass internment camps in the XUAR; to inquire about
the well-being of Turkic Muslims who have returned to
China after having studied or taught in their
institutions; to hold conferences and other programs to
raise awareness among students and the general public
about the mass, arbitrary detention of Turkic Muslims
in the XUAR; and to refrain from holding conferences or
establishing programs with Chinese government entities
that lend legitimacy to the mass surveillance and mass
arbitrary detention programs in place in the XUAR.
Urge Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) member
states to take coordinated action to pressure the
Chinese government to shut down mass internment camps
and end repressive security and surveillance measures
aimed at Muslim Chinese citizens, and to condemn mass
internment camps and human rights abuses of Muslim
Chinese citizens at OIC and other international forums.
In bilateral and multilateral consultations with the
governments of Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, raise
concerns regarding the detention of Kazakhs, Kyrgyz,
and Uyghurs in mass internment camps in the XUAR; work
with officials from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan to
pressure Chinese officials to release citizens and
residents of these two countries from mass internment
camps in the XUAR; and urge officials from Kazakhstan
and Kyrgyzstan not to deport ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, or
Uyghurs to China, where they are at risk of arbitrary
detention in mass internment camps and other types of
political persecution.

Intensified Repression in Mass Internment System
During the Commission's 2019 reporting year, authorities in
the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) expanded a system
of extrajudicial mass internment camps \1\ in which they
continued to arbitrarily detain predominantly Muslim ethnic
minorities, including Uyghurs, Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, Hui, and
others.\2\ Security personnel at the camps subjected detainees
to torture, including beatings; \3\ electric shocks; \4\
waterboarding; \5\ medical neglect; \6\ forced ingestion of
medication; \7\ sleep deprivation; \8\ extended solitary
confinement; \9\ and handcuffing or shackling for prolonged
periods,\10\ as well as restricted access to toilet facilities;
\11\ punishment for behavior deemed religious; \12\ forced
labor; \13\ overcrowding; \14\ deprivation of food; \15\ and
political indoctrination.\16\ Some detainees reportedly died in
camps due to poor conditions, medical neglect, or other
reasons.\17\ Deaths that occurred in mass internment camps or
shortly after release from camps included the following (this
list is illustrative of available reports and not exhaustive):
Forty-year-old Uyghur Mutellip Nurmehmet, who
earned two Master's degrees in the United States,
reportedly died nine days after authorities released
him from a camp.\18\
Renowned Uyghur writer Nurmuhemmet Tohti died
in May 2019 after being held in a mass internment camp
from November 2018 to March 2019.\19\ Tohti's Canada-
based relatives said the 70-year-old suffered from
diabetes and heart disease.\20\
Amine Qadir, a Uyghur in her early thirties,
died in a mass internment camp in early 2018. Qadir
reportedly had a heart condition that was not treated
by authorities at the camp where she was detained.\21\
Alimjan Emet, a 22-year-old Uyghur security
guard, reportedly died in a camp at an unknown date as
a result of being beaten during an interrogation.\22\
Aytursun Eli, a 35-year-old Uyghur woman who
had worked as the deputy head of a tourism company,
reportedly died during a police interrogation in June
2018. It was unclear whether Eli died in a mass
internment camp or at a police station.\23\
In March 2019, German researcher Adrian Zenz, speaking on a
panel co-hosted by the U.S. Government on the sidelines of the
UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, said he estimated that 1.5
million Uyghurs and other Muslims in the XUAR were or had been
detained in mass internment camps.\24\ According to this
estimate, nearly one in six adult Uyghurs are or have been
detained in the camps.\25\
Mass internment camps in the XUAR, though varied in size
and structure, included extremely large camps such as one
located in Dabancheng district, Urumqi municipality, XUAR.\26\
Using satellite imagery, analysts estimated the camp in
Dabancheng had the capacity to hold up to 130,000
detainees.\27\ Internment camps shared common features, such as
watchtowers,\28\ barracks,\29\ barbed wire,\30\ and reinforced
walls.\31\ Some camps were located in structures formerly used
as schools, hospitals, or other existing structures,\32\ and
some were newly constructed.\33\
MASS INTERNMENT CAMPS HAVE NO BASIS IN CHINESE LAW
Official Chinese media portrayed revised regional
regulations on extremism as justification for mass internment
camps, but the camps remained illegal under both Chinese and
international law. In October 2018, the XUAR People's Congress
revised the region's first anti-extremism regulations,\34\
which were adopted in March 2017,\35\ and official media
described the revisions as a legal basis for ``vocational
training centers'' combating ``extremism'' in the XUAR--an
apparent reference to mass internment camps.\36\ Prior to the
revisions,\37\ the regulations made no mention of ``vocational
training centers.'' \38\ International law also prohibits the
mass detention taking place in mass internment camps.\39\ For
example, as discussed by Lawfare contributor Hilary Hurd,
Article 1 of the International Convention on the Elimination of
All Forms of Racial Discrimination (ICERD) prohibits the forced
internment of Uyghurs ``on the basis of their religious, and
ethnic, identity.'' \40\ International legal scholars and
rights advocates stressed that, despite Chinese officials'
attempt to use the revised regulations to justify mass
internment camps, the revised local legislation did not provide
a legal basis for the camps, particularly because the PRC Law
on Legislation only allows deprivation of personal liberty
under statutes passed by the National People's Congress (NPC)
or its Standing Committee.\41\ At a June 2019 conference on
Uyghur human rights issues, George Washington University law
professor Donald Clarke emphasized that when a group of
American experts engaged in a bilateral legal dialogue asked
their Chinese counterparts to provide the legal basis for mass
internment camps, none of the counterparts were able to provide
a relevant legal basis.\42\
CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY AND MASS INTERNMENT
Scholars \43\ and rights groups \44\ provided a strong
argument, based on available evidence, that the ``crimes
against humanity'' framework may apply to the case of mass
internment camps in the XUAR. Article 7 of the Rome Statute of
the International Criminal Court provides a list of 11 acts
that may constitute ``crimes against humanity'' ``when
committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack directed
against any civilian population, with knowledge of the
attack.'' \45\ The following acts, listed in the Rome Statute,
may apply to the persecution of Turkic Muslims in the XUAR:

REASONS FOR DETENTION IN MASS INTERNMENT CAMPS
Security personnel continued to detain people in mass
internment camps for such reasons as engaging in ``religious
extremism'' or having foreign connections, such as previous
overseas travel or relatives living abroad.\54\ Chinese laws
define a wide range of peaceful religious customs as
``extremism,'' including the wearing of veils and having
``abnormal'' beards.\55\ In its March 2019 white paper, the
State Council Information Office said detainees in mass
internment camps, whom it referred to as ``trainees'' in
``education and training centers,'' included those ``who were
incited, coerced or induced into participating in terrorist or
extremist activities.'' \56\ According to the Xinjiang Victims
Database, a resource created by American researcher Gene Bunin
\57\ that contains information on political prisoners in the
XUAR,\58\ as of August 15, 2019, of the detainees for whom a
reason for detention had been provided, the top three reasons
were as follows: about 33 percent were detained for reasons
related to religion; about 20 percent were detained in relation
to having traveled abroad; and about 11 percent were detained
in connection with a relative or relatives.\59\
SHIFT IN OFFICIAL NARRATIVE FROM DENIAL TO DEFENSE
During this reporting year, Chinese authorities shifted the
official narrative regarding mass internment camps, moving from
denial of the camps' existence in early 2018 \60\ to a public
defense of the facilities.\61\ Rights advocates and scholars
noted that Chinese officials felt compelled to change their
narrative from denial to justification, in part following
criticism of the camps at an August 2018 review of China's
compliance with the ICERD by the UN Committee on the
Elimination of Racial Discrimination.\62\ In November 2018,
during China's Universal Periodic Review by the UN Human Rights
Council, Vice Foreign Minister Le Yucheng described the camps
as a measure that was effective in preventing people from
engaging in extremism and terrorism.\63\ In March 2019, XUAR
government chairperson Shohrat Zakir told NPC delegates that
the camps were ``like boarding schools where the students eat
and live for free,'' \64\ and that the camps had been
``effective in eliminating religious extremism.'' \65\ In a
March 2019 white paper, the State Council Information Office
said the camps ``fully respect and protect the customs and
habits of trainees of different ethnic groups,'' including by
``car[ing] for their mental health,'' and ``offer[ing]
psychological counseling services.'' \66\ In addition,
officials invited foreign journalists on escorted tours of mass
internment camps, during which they referred to the facilities
as voluntary educational institutions.\67\ During one such
trip, in April 2019, Bloomberg reporter Peter Martin noted that
there were bars on the windows of camp dormitories, and doors
that locked only from the outside.\68\
On July 30, 2019, Shohrat Zakir and XUAR government vice
chairperson Erkin Tuniyaz held a press conference to describe
what they referred to as the success of ``vocational education
and training centers,'' telling journalists that most people
had left the centers and obtained employment.\69\ Research
indicated authorities compelled many current and former camp
detainees to engage in forced labor, but reports did not
substantiate XUAR officials' claims that authorities had
released the majority of camp detainees.\70\ Observers,
including Uyghurs living abroad whose family members were
detained in camps, disputed the claims that most camp detainees
had been released.\71\ In August 2019, the New York Times
reported that the camp system continued to expand.\72\
While Chinese officials highlighted the occupational
benefits they said camp detainees obtained from vocational
education and training,\73\ official documents sometimes
referred to camps as ``transformation through education''
centers, a term that refers to ideological transformation.\74\
Chinese authorities have also used ``transformation through
education'' efforts to ``transform'' Falun Gong practitioners,
pressuring them to renounce their spiritual beliefs.\75\
Freedom House analyst Sarah Cook stated that Chinese Communist
Party and government officials who had influence on policies in
the XUAR ``appear[ed] to be following the anti-Falun Gong
playbook,'' and that some of these officials had previously
overseen the ``transformation'' of Falun Gong
practitioners.\76\
Documentation of Mass Internment Camps
Information on the scope, nature, and architecture of mass
internment camps, and on conditions for detainees in the camps,
primarily comes from the following sources:
ANALYSIS OF CHINESE GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS
Adrian Zenz's November 2018 publication on security
expenditures in the XUAR and other regions of China--research
based on openly accessible official Chinese documents--
illustrated that ``political reeducation'' carried out in mass
internment camps appeared to be aimed at ``political
indoctrination and intimidation.'' \77\ Zenz's research thus
refuted official Chinese claims that the purpose of mass
internment camps is to provide vocational education and
employment training.\78\ Specifically, Zenz analyzed
information posted online by the Chinese government, including
government procurement documents and construction bids for mass
internment camps in the XUAR.\79\ According to Zenz's research,
XUAR budgetary data showed that spending decreased on
vocational training between 2016 and 2017, while spending on
security-related facility construction, prisons, and detention
centers increased significantly.\80\
In October 2018, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that,
based on its analysis of 1,500 publicly available procurement
documents from local governments in the XUAR, authorities
administered mass internment camps in the same way as
prisons.\81\ AFP reported that government departments in charge
of administering camps ordered police uniforms, riot shields
and helmets, electrified batons, cattle prods, billy clubs,
spears, handcuffs, pepper spray, tear gas, tasers, net guns,
stun guns, and spiked clubs known as ``wolf's teeth'' to
maintain control over detainees.\82\ In addition, AFP
discovered orders for advanced surveillance systems,
surveillance cameras, razor wire, a telephone eavesdropping
system, and infrared monitoring equipment.\83\
TESTIMONIES FROM CAMP SURVIVORS AND FAMILY MEMBERS
In the past reporting year, Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and rights
advocates living outside of China have documented cases of
detention in XUAR mass internment camps, including by sharing
detention information online and speaking with international
media. In testimony presented at a U.S. Senate Foreign
Relations subcommittee hearing in April 2019, Uyghur-American
rights advocate Rushan Abbas said ``[a]lmost every Uyghur in
the U.S. has friends and family detained--sometimes dozens and
dozens of family members detained.'' \84\ Abbas said Chinese
authorities detained her sister and her aunt in China in
retaliation for her participation in a September 2018 panel on
repression in the XUAR that took place at a think tank in
Washington, DC.\85\ According to rights advocates, fear of
Chinese official retaliation against their family members or
friends prevented many Uyghurs and Kazakhs living outside of
China from publicizing the cases of camp detainees, but over
the past year, they have spoken out in increasing numbers.\86\
Radio Free Asia Uyghur Service journalists continued to
publicize the detention of their own family members in the
XUAR, which they viewed as retaliation for their reporting on
rights abuses.\87\
Online forums have provided overseas Uyghurs and Kazakhs
with opportunities to document the cases of internment camp
detainees. Many Uyghurs and Kazakhs began to publicize the
cases of their detained relatives and friends in February 2019,
after the Turkish Foreign Ministry criticized mass internment
camps and mourned the reported death of Uyghur musician
Abdurehim Heyit \88\ in one of the camps.\89\ The day after the
Turkish Foreign Ministry released its statement, an official
Chinese media organization released a video of Heyit, showing
that he was alive.\90\ The video's release prompted many
Uyghurs and Kazakhs living outside of China to post online
videos, pictures, and information about missing family members,
including some posts that linked to a social media campaign
using the hashtag ``#MeTooUyghur,'' in which they asked Chinese
authorities to release video of their detained relatives in
order to prove they were still alive.\91\ Uyghurs, Kazakhs, and
rights advocates have also compiled information on thousands of
political prisoners in mass internment camps and other
facilities in the online Xinjiang Victims Database, which
represents a small proportion of the total number of camp
detainees in the XUAR.\92\
INTERNATIONAL MEDIA REPORTS
International media documented the size of mass internment
camps, as well as the security features in place in and around
the camps, by traveling to camp sites throughout the XUAR.
Journalists from Reuters,\93\ BBC,\94\ and the Globe and Mail
\95\ independently traveled to camps throughout the XUAR to
document their existence. Journalists from international media
also interviewed former internment camp detainees and their
family members to document their experiences.\96\ For example,
a Washington Post contributor interviewed the wife of ethnic
Kazakh Chinese national Zharqynbek Otan, who returned to
Kazakhstan after authorities detained him in a camp and other
detention facilities in the XUAR for nearly two years.\97\
After his release, Otan, 31 years old, reportedly had problems
with his memory and difficulty recognizing his family
members.\98\
DETENTIONS OF FOREIGN RESIDENTS
Mass internment camp detainees reportedly included
permanent residents of the United States and Australia.
American officials stated in March 2019 that Chinese
authorities may have detained several American residents,
including the father of a man living in California.\99\ As of
August 2019, Chinese authorities reportedly detained ten or
more Australian residents in mass internment camps.\100\ In
addition, at least five Australian children were reportedly
unable to leave the XUAR due to restrictions on the freedom of
movement of their parents in the XUAR.\101\
ANALYSIS OF SATELLITE IMAGES
In November 2018, the International Cyber Policy Centre of
the Australian Strategic Policy Institute released a report
with research based on analysis of satellite imagery, as well
as existing scholarly research, news reports, and other
sources, which documented the recent expansion of both
individual mass internment camps and the camp system as a
whole.\102\ According to the Centre's report, which contained
analysis of 28 camp locations in the XUAR, these camps
increased in size by 465 percent from early 2016 to the quarter
ending in September 2018.\103\ The report determined that the
facilities being constructed ``appear intended for permanent
use.'' \104\
Additional satellite imagery analysis showed rapid growth
in the size and scope of camp facilities. In November 2018,
Reuters published a report based on analysis of satellite
images it conducted together with Earthrise Media, finding that
the size of 39 camps they chose to analyze had nearly tripled
between April 2017 and August 2018.\105\ In October 2018, BBC
published the findings of satellite imagery analysis it
conducted with aerospace company GMV, concluding that the
recent trend in camp construction was towards building larger
facilities.\106\
Forced Labor in Mass Internment Camps
According to international media reports, authorities
forced some mass internment camp detainees to engage in labor,
and forced former detainees to engage in labor following their
release from camps. According to research published by Adrian
Zenz in July 2019, authorities began establishing forced labor
programs for camp detainees and ``graduates'' in the second
half of 2018.\107\ At the same time, according to Zenz's
research, officials implemented extensive forced labor programs
that involved sending rural residents not detained in camps to
centralized training and employment, as well as programs in
``satellite factories'' located in villages in which rural,
mainly female, residents, were forced to work.\108\ Government
authorities provided subsidies to companies for each current or
former camp worker they trained and employed.\109\ Companies
from provinces and municipalities in eastern China also
employed forced labor in the XUAR, including in mass internment
camps, through a continuing ``pairing assistance''
program.\110\ Zenz wrote that, since camp detainees have been
forced to labor alongside others that have not been detained in
camps, ``it will soon become impossible to clearly determine
whether a labor-intensive manufacturing product in Xinjiang
will be made with labor from former detainees or not.'' \111\
U.S. Customs and Border Protection officials investigated
reports of forced labor products manufactured in a mass
internment camp being sold in the United States after the
Associated Press reported that an American sportswear company
had imported such products.\112\ Authorities in Ili (Yili)
Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture reportedly sent some former camp
detainees back to an internment camp after they refused the
terms of their forced labor in a factory.\113\ [For more
information on forced labor in the XUAR, see Section II--Human
Trafficking and Section II--Business and Human Rights.]
Transfer of Camp Detainees to Facilities Outside of the XUAR
Reports emerged that authorities transferred some detainees
from mass internment camps in the XUAR to detention facilities
in other parts of China, due to factors including overcrowding
in camps within the XUAR and authorities' desire to conceal
information on camp detainees.\114\ Authorities reportedly
carried out transfers in strict secrecy, including through
using ``sealed railway carriages,'' covering the windows of
vehicles transporting detainees, and blocking off roads used to
transport detainees.\115\ Radio Free Asia reported that
authorities transferred detainees to prisons in Heilongjiang
province; \116\ Gansu province; \117\ Shaanxi province; \118\
Sichuan province; \119\ Shandong province; \120\ and the Inner
Mongolia Autonomous Region.\121\ Authorities also reportedly
transferred camp detainees to other locations within the XUAR
due to concerns over existing relationships of camp employees
to detainees.\122\ On September 26, 2018, state media reported
that ticket sales for the regional rail system would be
suspended for trains departing on October 22 and later.\123\
Australian scholar James Leibold speculated that authorities
were transferring camp detainees in part in order to prevent
human rights monitors from being able to track what had
happened to them.\124\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detentions of Leading Turkic Cultural and Intellectual Figures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
As in the previous reporting year,\125\ officials continued to detain
leading Turkic intellectuals and cultural figures, including Uyghur,
Kazakh, and Kyrgyz scholars, musicians, writers, and journalists, in
mass internment camps and other facilities.\126\ According to an
American scholar and rights advocate, Chinese officials have attempted
to ``undermine Uyghur scholarly achievement and leadership through
indoctrination and terrorization of intellectuals.'' \127\
In May 2019, the U.S.-based organization Uyghur Human Rights Project
(UHRP) reported the detention or disappearance of at least 435
intellectuals since early 2017 in the XUAR, stating that the cases it
had documented were ``likely a small portion of those persecuted,''
given the lack of transparency in the region and the severe
consequences to individuals providing information about such
cases.\128\ UHRP cited University of Washington anthropologist Darren
Byler, who said Chinese authorities had focused on public figures
``working in speech or text-oriented mediums,'' in part because ``the
reeducation campaign specifically targets public figures who have
significant influence.'' \129\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detentions of Leading Turkic Cultural and Intellectual Figures--
Continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The detentions of Tashpolat Teyip \130\ and Sanubar Tursun \131\ are
illustrative of Chinese authorities' targeting of leading cultural
figures in the XUAR. According to reports published during this
reporting year, an unidentified court reportedly sentenced Teyip, the
president of Xinjiang University, to death with a two-year reprieve
sometime after he disappeared in March 2017.\132\ Authorities
reportedly accused Teyip, who received an honorary doctoral degree from
the Ecole Pratique des Hautes Etudes in Paris in 2008, of being a
``separatist'' and ``two-faced.'' \133\ In the case of Uyghur musician
Sanubar Tursun, an international artistic expression advocacy
organization reported in February 2019 that authorities may have
detained her in a mass internment camp in the XUAR, and cited
unconfirmed information that authorities may have sentenced her to five
years in prison.\134\ In November 2018, organizers canceled concerts
she had been scheduled to perform in France in February 2019, after her
international contacts could no longer reach her.\135\
Additional representative cases of detained Uyghur cultural and
intellectual figures are as follows: Uyghur medical scholar Halmurat
Ghopur; \136\ Uyghur comedian Adil Mijit; \137\ Uyghur singer Zahirshah
Ablimit; \138\ Uyghur journal editor Qurban Mamut; \139\ Uyghur
education official Satar Sawut; \140\ Uyghur editor and writer Yalqun
Rozi; \141\ and retired Uyghur professor Mutellip Sidiq Qahiri.\142\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Detentions of Kazakhs and Kyrgyz; Documentation in Kazakhstan and
Kyrgyzstan of XUAR Mass Internment Camps
XUAR authorities continued to detain ethnic Kazakhs in mass
internment camps, including some who held permanent residency
status in Kazakhstan, sometimes after officials requested that
they return to the XUAR from Kazakhstan.\143\ XUAR authorities
detained at least one Kazakh citizen who was born in
Kazakhstan, Gulbahar Jelilova, in a mass internment camp.\144\
Authorities detained Jelilova, an ethnic Uyghur businesswoman,
in May 2017, in Urumqi municipality, and held her in custody
for one year and three months after confiscating her Kazakh
passport and issuing her a Chinese identification
document.\145\ In December 2018, Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry
reported that Chinese officials had agreed to allow 2,500
ethnic Kazakhs in China to forfeit their Chinese citizenship
and go to Kazakhstan, but details of the move were
unclear.\146\ In March 2019, Kazakhstan's Foreign Ministry said
Chinese authorities had released 20 Kazakh citizens out of a
total of 33 held in mass internment camps.\147\ Nevertheless,
this past year, Kazakhstan authorities repeatedly denied asylum
to Chinese citizen Sayragul Sauytbay, an ethnic Kazakh, who
fled China in April 2018 after Chinese authorities compelled
her to work in a mass internment camp.\148\ In June 2019,
Sauytbay, her husband, and her children flew to Sweden on an
alien's passport issued by Swedish authorities.\149\
Kazakhs in Kazakhstan with family members detained in camps
in the XUAR increasingly publicized their cases, through social
media and online videos, often in cooperation with the Almaty-
based organization Atajurt Kazakh Human Rights
(``Atajurt'').\150\ In March 2019, Kazakhstan authorities
detained Atajurt head Serikzhan Bilash on charges of ``inciting
ethnic hatred'' and raided Atajurt's offices, removing
equipment used to videotape detention testimonies.\151\ In
August 2019, a court in Almaty, Kazakhstan, freed Bilash from
detention according to the terms of a plea agreement that
reportedly required him to curtail his rights advocacy
activities.\152\
Rights advocates in Kyrgyzstan also began documenting the
cases of detained ethnic Kyrgyz, including university students
whom Chinese authorities detained when the students returned to
China after studying in Kyrgyzstan.\153\
Forcible Displacement of the Children of Camp Detainees
Authorities have reportedly placed the children of mass
internment camp detainees in the XUAR in orphanages, welfare
centers, and boarding schools, often despite the willingness of
other relatives to care for the children, raising concerns of
forcible assimilation.\154\ In 2017, authorities developed a
strategy to invest billions of yuan in childcare and boarding
school facilities in the XUAR, and the creation of these
facilities largely coincided with the establishment of the mass
internment camp system in the region.\155\ Orphanages, boarding
schools, and other full- and part-time childcare facilities in
the XUAR house children with one or both parents in internment
or another form of detention or forced labor, and provide care
for children as young as several months old.\156\ Reports
suggested the number of displaced children is high: between
January 2017 and September 2018, the XUAR government reportedly
invested over US$30 million in 45 new orphanages.\157\ In 2017,
a county in Kashgar prefecture built 18 new orphanages,\158\
and authorities oversaw the regionwide building and renovation
of 4,300 ``bilingual'' kindergartens, some of which board
students.\159\ In 2018, Uyghurs in Turkey,\160\
Kazakhstan,\161\ and the U.S.\162\ began reporting the possible
disappearance and institutionalization of child relatives,
including several non-Chinese citizens. A human rights
organization expressed concern that authorities' displacement
of minority children from family homes into state-run
institutions, where orphans have long been raised according to
Han Chinese cultural norms,\163\ represented an attempt by the
government to forcibly assimilate Uyghurs.\164\
Intrusive Homestay Programs
Authorities continued to assign cadres and government
workers, usually of Han ethnicity, to live with ethnic minority
families in their homes for certain periods of time to gather
information that was used, in some cases, to send their hosts
to mass internment camps.\165\ According to official media, as
of September 2018, regional officials and other government
employees had made more than 49 million visits to ethnic
minority residents since the ``pairing relatives'' (jiedui
renqin) or ``pairing and assistance'' (jiedui bangfu or jiedui
fubang) program began in the fall of 2016.\166\ Government
workers are reportedly eligible for promotions if they
volunteer to take part in a homestay program to monitor ethnic
minority families and teach them about Communist Party
policies.\167\ According to an in-depth report by Darren Byler,
government workers who refused to take part in homestay
programs could lose their jobs.\168\ Under such programs,
workers, referred to as ``big brothers'' and ``big sisters,''
watch their host families for signs that their practice of
Islam is too ``extreme.'' Signs of a host family's
``extremism'' might include possession of the Quran; having an
acquaintance who lives abroad; and an unwillingness to drink
alcohol.\169\ Visiting cadres were authorized to ask children
in the family for information if they felt other family members
were evading their questions.\170\ The cadres then used the
information they compiled to decide whether to recommend that
authorities should send members of their host families to a
mass internment camp.\171\
Repressive Surveillance Technology and Security Measures
During this reporting year, XUAR government authorities
continued to use surveillance technology and other measures to
tighten state control over ethnic minority groups in the
region, and to identify individuals to detain in mass
internment camps.\172\ A report published by Human Rights Watch
in May 2019 documented authorities' continued use of a
centralized system known as the ``Integrated Joint Operations
Platform'' (IJOP) to compile and analyze information collected
through mass surveillance mechanisms in the XUAR and to detect
``abnormal'' behaviors, targeting individuals for detention in
camps or other types of restriction on movement.\173\ In
February 2019, Dutch cybersecurity researcher Victor Gevers
discovered an online database run by the Chinese facial
recognition company SenseNets that compiled real-time
information on the movements of more than 2.5 million
individuals in the XUAR, recording more than 6.7 million
coordinates in a 24-hour period.\174\ Gevers consequently
asserted that the database was used to surveil Uyghur
Muslims.\175\ According to international media reports,
SenseTime, which set up SenseNets together with Chinese firm
NetPosa Technologies in 2015, helped establish a ``smart
policing'' venture in the XUAR, and counted American and other
companies among its investors.\176\ [For more information on
surveillance measures and foreign commercial investment in
repressive security technology in the XUAR, see Section II--
Business and Human Rights.]
Freedom of Religion
During the reporting year, the head of the Chinese
Communist Party's United Front Work Department, You Quan, and
XUAR Party Secretary Chen Quanguo both emphasized the need to
``sinicize'' religion and resist ``religious extremism'' in the
XUAR under the direction of the Party.\177\ Chinese officials
justified measures to repress Islamic religious faith and
Muslim cultural identity, often by invoking ``sinicization''
and ``anti-extremism'' arguments.\178\ These measures included:
Restrictions on religious ceremonies,
including funerals and burial practices; \179\
The confiscation and destruction of religious
books and prayer mats; \180\
The policing of commonly used religiously
inflected phrases such as ``assalamu alaykum''; \181\
Cracking down on halal products and their
designation; \182\ and
Forcing some Muslims to drink alcohol and eat
pork, in violation of their religious beliefs.\183\
Throughout the XUAR, government and Party officials also
enforced the physical destruction and closure of mosques, as
well as policies restricting and deterring mosque
attendance.\184\ In May 2019, the Guardian newspaper released
the findings of research it had conducted with the journalism
site Bellingcat, using satellite imagery analysis, reporting
that 15 mosques and Islamic shrines out of 91 sites analyzed
had been destroyed or nearly destroyed between 2016 and
2018.\185\ Of the sites analyzed, the Guardian and Bellingcat
also found that 31 mosques and 2 major shrines, including the
prominent Keriya Heytgah Mosque in Hotan prefecture, XUAR, had
suffered significant structural damage.\186\ Scholars and
journalists reported that mosques throughout the XUAR were
empty of worshipers and featured security cameras, razor wire,
and security guards at entrances who were responsible for
checking visitors' identity documents.\187\
Officials throughout the XUAR detained Turkic Muslims in
mass internment camps for religious reasons. Examples of such
individuals whose detentions were reported in the past year
included an 80-year-old man detained in a camp for one year
reportedly in part because ``he was a Muslim who had a beard'';
\188\ an 87-year-old man detained in a camp because he could
read the Quran; \189\ a woman detained in a camp and a prison
for studying Islam at an Egyptian university; \190\ and a man
in his twenties whom authorities detained in a camp and then
sentenced to 15 years in prison for posting information and
photos about Islam on the messaging service WeChat.\191\
Authorities reportedly sentenced well-known Uyghur businessman
Abdughappar Abdurusul to death, possibly for making an
unsanctioned Islamic pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia.\192\
As in previous reporting years,\193\ XUAR officials
reportedly imposed controls on Muslims' observance of Ramadan.
Turkic Muslim residents of the XUAR faced restrictions on
fasting,\194\ mosque attendance,\195\ and the exchange of
Islamic greetings.\196\ Authorities reportedly forced some
Muslim civil servants and students to eat lunch during Ramadan
\197\ and forced some Uyghur Muslims to eat pork in spite of
their Muslim faith.\198\

Findings
There has been no formal dialogue between the
Dalai Lama's representatives and Chinese Communist
Party and government officials since the ninth round of
dialogue was held in January 2010. The Chinese
government continues to regard the Dalai Lama as a
``separatist'' and to reject his Middle Way approach of
genuine Tibetan autonomy within China.
The Chinese government and Communist Party
have significantly tightened restrictions on access to
the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan
areas in China for international journalists, non-
governmental organizations (NGOs), foreign officials,
scholars, and members of the Tibetan diaspora. Chinese
authorities require all foreign visitors to the TAR to
apply for a special permit. Tourists must be
accompanied by government-designated tour guides and
are only allowed to see controlled sites. International
journalists have stated that the isolation of the TAR
is worse than North Korea, allowing the Chinese
government to conceal human rights abuses and
environmentally damaging large-scale projects, such as
river damming and mining, and to promote the claim that
Tibetans benefit from and support the Party and its
actions.
The government and Party used increasingly
advanced technology to intensify security and
surveillance in the TAR and other Tibetan autonomous
areas, and continued to use measures included in a
nationwide ``anti-crime and vice'' campaign to crack
down on Tibetans suspected of organizing or
participating in activities that authorities deemed to
be threatening to maintaining control or ``social
stability.''
Authorities continued to restrict religious
freedom in the name of ``sinicization,'' using policies
that force religious believers to promote the Party's
agenda. Actions taken included mandatory political
education for religious leaders, large-scale evictions
from influential Tibetan Buddhist monasteries, and
replacing visibly displayed images of Tibetan
Buddhists' spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, with past
and current Party leaders Mao Zedong and Xi Jinping.
The Chinese government continued to pursue
large-scale infrastructure and investment projects in
the TAR and other Tibetan areas, including hydropower
dams, mines, and the resettlement of Tibetan nomads,
with no apparent representative input from the Tibetan
population, independent environmental NGOs, or rights
groups. These actions violate the social, economic, and
cultural rights of Tibetans, such as their rights to
housing and livelihood, and raised concern among
environmental scientists and advocates about the
regional and global impact of these projects.
April 25, 2019, marked the 30th birthday of
the Panchen Lama, Gedun Choekyi Nyima, whom the Dalai
Lama recognized in 1995. He and his parents remain
incommunicado since authorities took them into custody
in May 1995. Moreover, in violation of the religious
freedom of Tibetan Buddhists, the government continued
to promote public appearances by its chosen Panchen
Lama, Gyaltsen Norbu, including his first trip abroad
to Thailand, and to a sacred Tibetan Buddhist site,
adding to speculation that Chinese officials will
eventually attempt to use him in efforts to select the
next Dalai Lama.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Call on the Chinese government and Communist Party to
respect--as a matter of the right to religious freedom
recognized under Chinese and international law--that
the decision regarding the Dalai Lama's succession or
reincarnation must be reserved for the current Dalai
Lama, Tibetan Buddhist leaders, and the Tibetan people.
Urge the Chinese government to recognize the role of
restrictive Party policies and government measures, and
the increasing securitization of Tibetan autonomous
areas of China, in Tibetan self-immolations and
protests. Urge the Chinese government to cease treating
the Dalai Lama as a security threat, and stress to the
government the importance of respecting and protecting
Tibetan culture and language--policy changes that would
promote and protect social stability in Tibetan areas.
Encourage the Chinese government to respect the right
of Tibetans to travel domestically as well as
internationally, and to allow unrestricted access to
Tibetan autonomous areas of China to international
journalists, representatives of the United Nations and
NGOs, U.S. Government officials, and members of the
Tibetan diaspora living around the world.
Call on the Chinese government to remove all
restrictions on foreigners' access to the TAR. The
Administration should use existing laws to hold
accountable Chinese government officials and others
complicit in restricting access to the TAR, including
by using the sanctions available in the Reciprocal
Access to Tibet Act (Public Law No. 115-330). Encourage
the Chinese government to invite independent observers
with relevant expertise to assess and publicly report
on the damage incurred by the February 2018 fire at the
1,300-year-old Jokhang temple in Lhasa municipality,
TAR.
Urge the Chinese government to withdraw the charges
against Tibetan language rights advocate Tashi Wangchug
and stress that peacefully advocating for genuine
bilingual education--a right recognized under Chinese
and international law--is not a crime.
In interactions with Chinese officials, call for the
release of Tibetan political prisoners currently
detained or imprisoned for the peaceful exercise of
their human rights. The records of detained Tibetans in
the Commission's Political Prisoner Database--albeit an
incomplete picture of the extent of Tibetan detentions
and disappearances--provide a useful resource for such
interactions with Chinese officials. Urge the Chinese
government and its security forces to cease using
arbitrary detention, disappearance, beatings, torture,
and intimidation to suppress and punish Tibetans'
peaceful exercise of their rights.
Urge the Chinese government to take into full account
the views and preferences of Tibetans when planning
infrastructure, natural resource development,
settlement or resettlement projects, and tourist
attractions in Tibetan areas of China.
Continue to request that the Chinese government
invite an independent representative of an
international organization to meet with Gedun Choekyi
Nyima, the 11th Panchen Lama, whom the Dalai Lama
recognized in 1995, and who has been held incommunicado
since May 17, 1995.

Introduction
During the November 2018 session of the UN Human Rights
Council Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of China's human rights
record, the Chinese government promised to ``actively
participate in international cooperation in human rights,'' \1\
pledged its support for the work of UN human rights
mechanisms,\2\ and touted its legal and other actions aimed at
the protection of human rights.\3\ In contradiction to these
statements, several foreign governments and international, non-
governmental rights groups reported at the UPR and elsewhere
that the human rights situation for Tibetans in the Tibet
Autonomous Region (TAR) and other Tibetan areas of China had
worsened in 2018.\4\ Various stakeholders at the UPR stated
that Chinese authorities had continued to violate the rights of
Tibetans to freedom of religion,\5\ movement,\6\ association
and assembly,\7\ and expression,\8\ as well as their cultural
\9\ and economic rights.\10\ Rights groups documented Chinese
authorities' continued oppression of Tibetans through the use
of such measures as arbitrary detention,\11\ enforced
disappearances,\12\ torture,\13\ intrusive and increasingly
sophisticated surveillance and data collection,\14\ and the
forcible resettlement of nomads.\15\ During the Commission's
2019 reporting year, Chinese authorities used many of these
measures as part of a nationwide anti-crime campaign launched
in early 2018 that included the TAR and Tibetan autonomous
areas.\16\
Status of Negotiations Between the Chinese Government and the Dalai
Lama or His Representatives
There has been no formal dialogue between the Dalai Lama or
his representatives and the Chinese government since the ninth
round of dialogue in January 2010.\17\ The Chinese government
continues to regard the Dalai Lama as a ``separatist'' \18\ and
to reject his Middle Way approach of genuine Tibetan autonomy
within China.\19\ Reports published this past year, including
one by the Tibetan government-in-exile, rejected the Chinese
government's narrative of its historical control over the TAR
and other Tibetan areas.\20\ The Central Tibetan Administration
asserted that ``[t]oday's continued occupation of Tibet by
China . . . violates international law and the fundamental
rights of the Tibetan people.'' \21\ Based on this assertion,
the Tibetan government-in-exile continues to call for a
peaceful, negotiated resolution to the Sino-Tibetan
conflict.\22\
Government and Party Policy
ANTI-CRIME AND VICE CAMPAIGN IN THE TAR AND TIBETAN AREAS OF CHINA
During this reporting year, Chinese authorities continued
the anti-crime and vice campaign launched in early 2018 aimed
at those who allegedly threaten ``political security'' and
``social stability.'' \23\ The Tibetan Centre for Human Rights
and Democracy (TCHRD) reported that Chinese authorities had
intensified control and repression in Tibetan areas of China,
including the criminalization of ordinary social welfare
activities,\24\ and turned ``Tibet into a human rights black
hole.'' \25\
The following are examples in which authorities used the
anti-crime and vice campaign to further crack down in Tibetan
areas of China this past year:
According to Voice of Tibet, Chinese
authorities detained ``a large number'' of Tibetans in
Lhasa municipality, capital of the TAR.\26\ Authorities
in the TAR and other Tibetan areas reportedly posted
notices asking people to inform on others suspected of
involvement in such activities as ``extremism,''
``splittism,'' ``connections with the Dalai clique,''
advocating ``freedom to use one's language,''
``resisting land grabs, demolitions, infrastructure
projects, and . . . related development projects,'' and
``espousing causes like economic freedom, right to
livelihood, environmental protection, [and] cultural
freedom,'' offering cash rewards to informants in at
least one county.\27\
According to TCHRD and Radio Free Asia, in
July 2018, public security authorities detained Tibetan
villagers Gedun Zoepa, Choesang, Bende Dorje, Tashi
Tsering, Sonam Gyal, Dargye, Shawo Tsering, Khajam
Gyal, and Drugbum Tsering, all of whom are from Horgyal
(Huorijia) village, Rongbo (Longwu) town, Rebgong
(Tongren) county, Malho (Huangnan) Tibetan Autonomous
Prefecture (TAP), Qinghai province, after they wrote a
petition to reclaim village property expropriated by
local government authorities.\28\ In April 2019, the
Tongren County People's Court sentenced them to between
three and seven years in prison on the charges of
founding an ``evil organization'' and ``disturb[ing]
social order by mobilizing support from the public.''
\29\
INTENSIFYING SECURITY AND SURVEILLANCE
This reporting year, Chinese authorities reportedly
continued to use ``pervasive surveillance apparatus,'' \30\
including security cameras, big data centers,\31\ artificial
intelligence,\32\ and ``grid'' surveillance.\33\ Authorities
also reportedly confiscated and secretly installed surveillance
apps on Tibetans' mobile phones.\34\
The following examples illustrate Chinese authorities'
efforts to tighten control in Tibetan areas of China:
In July 2018, authorities displaced over 200
monks under the age of 18 from at least two monasteries
in Kardze (Ganzi) county, Kardze (Ganzi) TAP, Sichuan
province, and forced them instead to attend government-
run schools.\35\
In September 2018, Tibet University and Wise-
web Technology Company jointly launched a big data
center to track the real-time activities of
tourists.\36\ The Party-run Global Times, citing a
professor at Minzu University in Beijing municipality,
noted that ``developing tourism in Tibet is also an
important move to safeguard regional stability, promote
national unity, and guard against separatist forces.''
\37\
In October 2018, Party officials opened a new
``political education camp'' in Shigatse (Rikaze)
municipality, TAR, to provide training in Party
ideology and policies for officials throughout the
municipality, with a particular focus on work related
to ``grassroots Party building'' and ``anti-
separatism.'' \38\
Prior to the 60th anniversary of the 1959
Tibetan uprising on March 10, 2019, Chinese authorities
closed the TAR to foreign visitors for two months,\39\
restricted inter-regional travel by Tibetans,\40\ and
added facial recognition, big data analysis, and
upgraded GPS tracking devices in taxi cabs to monitor
drivers.\41\
Following the passage of the Reciprocal Access
to Tibet Act (RATA) by the U.S. Government in December
2018,\42\ TAR authorities announced plans to speed up
the process for obtaining the special permit required
of foreigners to visit the TAR.\43\ In March 2019, the
State Department reported that the Chinese government
``systematically impeded travel'' by U.S. diplomats,
officials, journalists, and tourists to Tibetan areas
in 2018.\44\
In April 2019, Radio Free Asia reported that
authorities closed enrollment at Larung Gar Buddhist
Institute in Serthar (Seda) county, Kardze (Ganzi) TAP,
Sichuan, after having recently built walls and
checkpoints to prevent entry, while keeping monks and
nuns under strict surveillance.\45\ In summer 2016,
authorities began demolishing homes and forcibly
expelling monks and nuns from Larung Gar, in an effort
to reduce their numbers from around 10,000 to
5,000.\46\
From May to July 2019, authorities forcibly
evicted an estimated 3,500 monks and nuns from Yachen
Gar, a major Tibetan Buddhist institute in Palyul
(Baiyu) county, Kardze (Ganzi) TAP, Sichuan.\47\ In
July, authorities demolished at least 100 dwellings of
recently evicted nuns, despite appeals by senior monks
to authorities.\48\
Religious Freedom for Tibetan Buddhists
REINCARNATION AND THE SELECTION OF THE 15TH DALAI LAMA
As the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, turned 84 years old
on July 6, 2019,\49\ his advancing age continued to fuel
discussion about his succession.\50\ The Chinese government
continued to claim the authority to manage the selection and
education of his successor through the state-controlled
Buddhist Association of China,\51\ stating that ``reincarnation
of living Buddhas including the Dalai Lama must comply with
Chinese laws and regulations and follow religious rituals and
historical conventions.'' \52\ In July 2019, a Party official
in the TAR said that the Dalai Lama's reincarnation ``must be
recognized by the central government,'' and that the
reincarnation would not be ``decided by his personal wish or by
some group of people living in other countries.'' \53\ The
government's position violates international standards of
religious freedom, which guarantee the right of religious
communities ``to train, appoint, elect or designate by
succession appropriate leaders.'' \54\ The Dalai Lama has
stated that the Chinese Communist Party, which rejects belief
in reincarnation, has no authority or role in the recognition
of reincarnated Lamas.\55\ Furthermore, he said that anyone
chosen by the Party would not be accepted by Tibetan
Buddhists,\56\ reiterating this position in a March 2019
interview with international media outlet Reuters.\57\
April 25, 2019, marked the 30th birthday of Gedun Choekyi
Nyima, whom the Dalai Lama recognized as the Panchen Lama in
1995.\58\ He and his family remain incommunicado since
authorities abducted them in May 1995.\59\ The Chinese
government's chosen Panchen Lama, Gyaltsen Norbu, continued to
appear in public, including at the sacred Buddhist site Lhamo
Latso lake in Lhokha (Shannan) municipality, Tibet Autonomous
Region (TAR), in August 2018,\60\ and made his first trip
abroad to Thailand in May 2019, where he reportedly praised the
``greatness'' of the Chinese Communist Party.\61\
``SINICIZATION'' OF TIBETAN BUDDHISM
During this reporting year, Chinese authorities issued
directives that curtailed previously tolerated religious
practices under the national ``Sinicization of Religion''
policy promoted by President Xi Jinping beginning in April
2016.\62\ Such directives contravene the freedom of religious
belief guaranteed in China's Constitution \63\ and violate the
right to freedom of religion defined in international human
rights instruments, such as the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights.\64\
The Commission observed the following violations of Tibetan
Buddhists' right to religious freedom in this reporting year:
Promotion of the Sinicization of Tibetan
Buddhism. Authorities held a seminar in Sichuan
province in October 2018 to discuss the ``adaptation of
Tibetan Buddhism to socialist society.'' \65\ At a
symposium in Qinghai province that same day, one of the
major topics of discussion for monks and scholars was
``how Buddhism could better serve China's Belt and Road
Initiative.'' \66\
Cancellation of a major prayer festival at
Larung Gar. In October 2018, authorities canceled the
weeklong Dechen Shingdrup festival at Larung Gar
Buddhist Institute, in Serthar (Seda) county, Kardze
(Ganzi) Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture (TAP), Sichuan
province, for the third consecutive year.\67\
Forced removal of photos of the 14th Dalai
Lama from temples and homes. In December 2018,
authorities in Dzoege Toema (Zuogeduoma) township, Tsoe
(Hezuo) city, Kanlho (Gannan) TAP, Gansu province,
reportedly announced a ``Specialized Cleanup of the
14th Dalai Lama's Portraits,'' requiring locals to
replace pictures of the Dalai Lama with portraits of
former Party Chairman Mao Zedong and current Party
General Secretary Xi Jinping.\68\ Following the Dalai
Lama's birthday in July 2019, police in Palyul (Baiyu)
county, Kardze (Ganzi) TAP, Sichuan, reportedly beat
Tibetan residents in two subsidized resettlement
communities for displaying photos of the Dalai Lama in
their homes.\69\ Public security officials also
reportedly detained several individuals who had burnt
incense and offered prayers on his birthday.\70\
Mandatory political education for monks and
nuns. In December 2018, the TAR Party Committee
announced that all religious personnel and officials
must attend a three- to five-year political education
workshop.\71\ In March 2019, Chinese official sources
reported that authorities required 30,000 monks to take
exams on Chinese laws and regulations, including the
PRC Anti-Terrorism Law and the PRC Counterespionage
Law.'' \72\
Restrictions on religious education. In
December 2018, authorities in Nangchen (Nangqian)
county, Yulshul (Yushu) TAP, Qinghai province, banned
classes offered by monks, proscribing them as
``ideological infiltration among the young,''
``dangerous,'' and ``harmful.'' \73\
Forced acts of worship of Chinese leaders. In
January 2019, authorities in Serthar (Seda) county,
Kardze (Ganzi) TAP, Sichuan, reportedly forced Tibetans
to prostrate and make offerings before pictures of
Chinese Communist Party leaders, including Xi
Jinping.\74\ A January report disclosed that in May
2018, authorities also had ordered Lhasa municipality
residents, some of whom are dependent on state
assistance due to previous government land seizures, to
stop worshiping the Buddha or risk losing their
subsidies.\75\
Self-Immolation
At least two self-immolations as a form of protest occurred
in Tibetan autonomous areas of China this past year.\76\
According to Tibetan advocacy groups, Chinese government
suppression of Tibetans' freedoms of expression and religion
have led some Tibetans to turn to self-immolation as
protest.\77\ According to the International Campaign for Tibet
and the Central Tibetan Administration (the Tibetan government-
in-exile located in Dharamsala, India), more than 150 Tibetans
have self-immolated since 2009, with many calling for the long
life of the Dalai Lama, his return from exile, and freedom for
Tibet.\78\
The Commission observed the following cases of Tibetans who
self-immolated as a form of protest:
On November 4, 2018, a 23-year-old man named
Dopo (or Dorbe) reportedly died after self-immolating
in Ngaba (Aba) county, Ngaba (Aba) Tibetan and Qiang
Autonomous Prefecture (T&QAP), Sichuan province, while
shouting wishes to see the Dalai Lama and for his long
life.\79\ Radio Free Asia also reported that
authorities quickly controlled the scene and refused to
provide further information.\80\
On December 8, 2018, a former monk in his
twenties named Drugkho, previously known as Choekyi
Gyaltsen,\81\ from Soruma (Suorima) village, Choejema
(Qiujima) township, Ngaba county, reportedly self-
immolated in Ngaba county while shouting for the Dalai
Lama's long life and freedom for Tibet.\82\ According
to one Tibetan advocacy organization, Drugkho
reportedly survived.\83\
Following these two self-immolations, authorities increased
security measures in the area, including reportedly blocking
internet communications.\84\
Status of Tibetan Culture and Language
The Chinese government's National Human Rights Action Plan
(2016-2020) provides both that ``the cultural rights of ethnic
minorities shall be guaranteed'' and that ``[t]he right of
ethnic minorities to learn, use and develop their own spoken
and written languages shall be respected and guaranteed,''
echoing provisions of China's Constitution, the PRC Regional
Ethnic Autonomy Law, and the PRC Education Law.\85\ In March
2019, the State Council Information Office released the white
paper, ``Democratic Reform in Tibet--Sixty Years On,'' which
featured two aims regarding Tibetan language: ``While
protecting and developing the Tibetan language, the state is
promoting . . . standard Chinese across the country, including
[in] Tibet . . ..'' \86\ In contradiction to the stated aim to
protect and develop the Tibetan language, authorities continued
to restrict access to Tibetan language education and suppress
Tibetan language education advocacy this past year:
According to Radio Free Asia, in December
2018, Chinese authorities restricted Tibetan language
classes for children at monasteries in Nangchen
(Nangqian) county, Yulshul (Yushu) TAP, Qinghai
province.\87\
In January 2019, authorities at Dongchuan
Prison in Xining municipality, Qinghai, reportedly
barred a lawyer from meeting with Tibetan language
education advocate Tashi Wangchug (Tashi Wangchuk),
whom the Yushu TAP Intermediate People's Court in
Yushu, Qinghai, sentenced to five years in prison in
May 2018 on the charge of ``inciting separatism.'' \88\
By blocking this meeting, authorities effectively
denied him his right to proceed with a criminal
petition (shensu).\89\ In August 2019, prison
authorities again barred lawyers from meeting with him,
despite their submission of required documents.\90\
Freedom of Expression
The U.S. State Department and the international non-
governmental organization Human Rights Watch reported in 2019
that the Chinese government continued to restrict freedom of
speech and assembly in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) and
Tibetan areas of China.\91\ According to the State Department,
``The Chinese government harassed or detained Tibetans as
punishment for speaking to foreigners, attempting to provide
information to persons abroad, or communicating information
regarding protests . . ..'' \92\ The State Department also
reported that authorities had restricted internet service ``for
weeks or months at a time'' during times deemed to be
politically sensitive or times of unrest, and threatened
Tibetans with prison sentences for sharing videos or
information about self-immolations.\93\ A Tibetan researcher
reported that Chinese authorities had ``crack[ed] down hard on
[social media platform] WeChat users who demonstrate sympathy
and support for the Tibetan cause,'' including the use of
``restrictions and fines.'' \94\
Representative examples of violations of Tibetans' right to
free expression this past year include:
In September 2018, authorities in Kyangche
(Jiangqian) township, Gade (Gande) county, Golog
(Guoluo) TAP, Qinghai, reportedly beat and detained
Sengdra, a Tibetan advocate known for his campaign
against corruption, on suspicion of ``picking quarrels
and provoking trouble.'' \95\
In September 2018, authorities in Ngaba (Aba)
county, Ngaba (Aba) Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous
Prefecture, Sichuan province, reportedly detained
Tenzin Geleg, an 18-year-old monk from Ngaba's Kirti
Monastery, after he conducted a solo protest calling
for freedom for Tibet.\96\ In the same month,
authorities also reportedly detained 23-year-old monk
Dorje Rabten and another unidentified monk, both also
from Kirti, after they staged solo protests.\97\
On December 10, 2018, authorities in Ngaba reportedly
severely beat and detained Sanggye Gyatso, a 16- or 17-year-old
monk also from Kirti Monastery, as he staged a solo protest
calling for ``Freedom for Tibet.'' \98\
On April 29, 2019, public security officials
in Sershul (Shiqu) county, Kardze (Ganzi) TAP, Sichuan,
detained four Tibetan men in connection with one of
them, Wangchen, praying and reportedly shouting slogans
calling for the release of the 11th Panchen Lama,
despite warnings from other monks of possible arrest by
police.\99\ In May, a court sentenced Wangchen to four
years and six months in prison for leading an illegal
public protest.\100\ On May 2, authorities detained his
aunt Drolkar, and later that month sentenced her to one
year and three months' imprisonment for sharing
information about the protest.\101\
During this reporting year, the Commission did
not observe further news about the large February 2018
fire at the Jokhang temple in Lhasa municipality, TAR,
one of Tibetan Buddhism's holiest sites and a UNESCO
World Heritage site.\102\ An international advocacy
organization used satellite imagery analysis to show
that the fire did more damage than the government
reported, and cited commentators who criticized the
government's failure to report the severity of the
damage.\103\ Authorities also reportedly censored the
online sharing of information about the fire.\104\
Neither Chinese media reports on activities at the
Jokhang in April 2019 nor an international media report
on U.S. Ambassador to China Terry Branstad's visit to
the temple in May 2019 mentioned the fire, resulting
damage, or repair efforts.\105\
In April 2019, authorities reportedly detained
Tibetan graduate student Sonam Lhundrub at Northwest
Minzu University in Lanzhou municipality, Gansu
province, after he posted an essay on social media
criticizing the decline in opportunities to obtain
government jobs for Tibetans in Tibetan areas.\106\
Freedom of Movement
The Chinese government continued to restrict Tibetans'
freedom of movement in violation of the International Covenant
on Civil and Political Rights, which articulates the rights of
every person to ``liberty of movement and freedom to choose his
residence''; ``freedom to leave any country, including his
own''; and ``the right to enter his own country.'' \107\
Authorities tightened borders in Tibetan regions and restricted
Tibetans' ability to travel abroad.\108\
The Commission observed the following restrictions on
Tibetans' movement and travel this past year:
According to TCHRD's 2018 annual report,
authorities required Tibetan visitors to Lhasa from
Tibetan areas outside the TAR to surrender their ID
cards and obtain special permits to enter the city, and
to undergo close searches and frisking at checkpoints
in order to visit the Jokhang temple.\109\
Tibetans wishing to travel abroad, especially
for pilgrimage to India for the Dalai Lama's annual
teachings at Bodh Gaya, India in December 2018, faced
barriers in obtaining passports.\110\ Authorities
reportedly subjected Tibetan travelers to a ``two-
track'' passport system,\111\ long interrogations, and
cancellation of passports or denial of permission to
travel at airports without refunds.\112\ Authorities
had also reportedly confiscated and destroyed the
passports of returning Tibetan pilgrims after the 2018
annual teachings.\113\
The U.S. State Department reported that the
``People's Armed Police (PAP) and local public security
bureaus (PSB) set up roadblocks and checkpoints in
Tibetan areas . . . especially around sensitive dates''
\114\ and that authorities required monks and nuns to
undergo ``extra scrutiny . . . at roadside checkpoints
and at airports.'' \115\
According to TCHRD, in 2018, Chinese
authorities in Rebgong (Tongren) county, Malho
(Huangnan) TAP, Qinghai, informed a Tibetan refugee
visiting from India that, as of January 2018, Tibetans
returning to China were not allowed to permanently
reside in their hometowns.\116\ TCHRD found no evidence
that the statement was connected to any formal
policy.\117\
Economy, Environment, and Development Concerns
Economy. According to the Office of the UN
High Commissioner for Human Rights summary of rights
groups' submissions in advance of the November 2018
session of the UN Human Rights Council's Universal
Periodic Review (UPR) of China, the Chinese
government's ``large-scale infrastructure and
investment projects in Tibet . . . often resulted in
violations of Tibetan's [sic] economic, social, and
cultural rights, such as their rights to livelihood and
to adequate housing.'' \118\
Environment. The Chinese government has
designated large areas in the TAR and Qinghai province
as national parks, and has relocated Tibetans for the
stated purposes of protecting ecosystems and improving
the livelihoods of local residents.\119\ Tibetan groups
state, however, that government claims about the need
to protect the environment are also used as a pretext
to forcibly resettle Tibetans from traditional grazing
lands.\120\ Scientists and Tibetan groups note that
many government actions on the Tibetan Plateau
exacerbate climate change, resulting in glacial
melting, permafrost degradation, and desertification of
grasslands.\121\
Water rights. Many of Asia's major rivers
originate on the Tibetan Plateau, known as the ``Third
Pole'' and ``water tower of Asia.'' \122\ A Tibet
researcher argued that the government's dams and water
diversion projects on many of Asia's rivers violate the
water rights of Tibetans and over 1.3 billion people in
downstream countries who are dependent on these rivers
for drinking water and agriculture.\123\
Development. The Chinese government continued
to forcibly resettle Tibetans throughout the TAR and
other Tibetan areas of China for the stated purposes of
development and poverty alleviation.\124\ Between
January and May 2019, Radio Free Asia reported the
following:
Authorities forced Tibetan nomadic families
in Chamdo (Changdu) municipality, TAR, to move
into towns and pay nearly 8,000 yuan (US$1,165)
for their new homes.\125\
Authorities removed 12 families from Gonjo
(Gongjue) county, Chamdo, and relocated them to
Nyingchi (Linzhi) municipality, TAR.\126\
Nomadic families who were forcibly resettled
several years ago to an area east of Chengguan
district, Lhasa municipality, TAR, were
suffering financial and other hardships due to
the loss of their livelihoods and the failure
of authorities to provide promised
assistance.\127\
Authorities resettled around 40 Tibetan
families from their village in Qinghai for
airport construction.\128\
Some attempts by Tibetans to oppose development projects
have led to violence against or detention of protesters.
Observers reported the following:
On September 11, 2018, authorities detained
five monks at Gomang Monastery in Ngaba (Aba) county,
Ngaba (Aba) Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture,
Sichuan province, for protesting a residential
construction project near the monastery.\129\
On October 11, 2018, Han Chinese workers
reportedly attacked Tibetans who were protesting their
work installing solar panels on grazing land in Chabcha
(Gonghe) county, Tsolho (Hainan) Tibetan Autonomous
Prefecture, Qinghai.\130\

Findings
The Commission observed a further erosion of
Hong Kong's autonomy and fundamental freedoms under the
``one country, two systems'' framework. The Hong Kong
government sought to advance changes to the territory's
extradition ordinance to allow the surrender of
individuals to mainland China and to empower the Chief
Executive to make decisions on fugitive arrangements on
a case-by-case basis without a vetting process in the
Legislative Council (LegCo). If passed, the bill would
expose local and foreign citizens transiting, visiting,
or residing in Hong Kong to the risk of being
extradited to mainland China.
A series of large-scale anti-extradition bill
and pro-democracy demonstrations took place in Hong
Kong beginning in late March 2019. Protests continued
despite the Hong Kong government's decision to
suspend--but not withdraw--consideration of the
extradition bill. Protesters demanded that the
government withdraw the extradition bill, retract the
characterization of protests on June 12 as a ``riot,''
drop charges against all arrested protesters, establish
an independent commission of inquiry on police conduct,
and enact democratic reforms toward universal suffrage
in Hong Kong's Chief Executive and LegCo elections.
International and Hong Kong human rights
groups, journalists, and crowd-control experts noted
that the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) used excessive
force and inappropriately operated crowd-control
equipment in instances during the 2019 protests. The
HKPF fired projectiles including rubber bullets, bean
bag rounds, and pepper balls at close range; launched
tear gas canisters into crowded and enclosed areas and
from high buildings, did not give warning before firing
tear gas, and struck individuals with tear gas
canisters; and misused batons against protesters,
causing blunt force trauma. The HKPF's use of force
contravened international standards enumerated in the
United Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement
Officials and the Basic Principles on the Use of Force
and Firearms for Law Enforcement Officials, both of
which require officials to avoid using force, or where
necessary, use the minimum extent of force at a
proportionate level.
The Chinese central government employed
propaganda, disinformation, and censorship in an
apparent attempt to shape reporting on the Hong Kong
protests, attributing the protests to influence by
``foreign forces,'' and signaling threats to protesters
in Hong Kong. Central government authorities issued
directives to delete or promote certain content on all
websites and news media platforms and detained and
harassed citizens in mainland China who showed support
for the Hong Kong protests on their social media
accounts. The Chinese government's restrictions on
expression violate Article 19 of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guaranteeing the
right to freedom of expression.
Over the past year, the Hong Kong government
continued to reject the candidacy of LegCo and local
election nominees such as Lau Siu-lai and Eddie Chu
Hoi-dick based on their political beliefs and
associations, violating Article 21 of the Hong Kong
Bill of Rights Ordinance guaranteeing the right to
``vote and be elected at genuine periodic elections.''
The Hong Kong government continued to pursue
criminal charges against leaders and participants of
public demonstrations, including the 2014 pro-democracy
protests (``Umbrella Movement''). In April 2019, a Hong
Kong court found nine leaders of the Umbrella Movement
guilty of charges related to ``public nuisance'' and
sentenced Benny Tai Yiu-ting and Chan Kin-man to one
year and four months in prison and Raphael Wong Ho-ming
and Shiu Ka-chun to eight months in prison.
The Commission did not observe progress in
Macau toward universal suffrage in the 2019 Chief
Executive (CE) election. Former Macau Legislative
Assembly president Ho Iat Seng--running as the only
candidate--won the CE election on August 25, 2019. Ho
received 392 out of 400 possible votes from the CE
Election Committee, many of whose members are
considered to be supporters of the central government.
Recommendations
Members of the U.S. Congress and Administration officials
are encouraged to:
Reassess whether Hong Kong authorities are ``legally
competent,'' in accordance with the U.S.-Hong Kong
Policy Act of 1992, to enforce the U.S.-Hong Kong
Extradition Treaty and other obligations in the act,
including support for U.S. businesses and the
protection of human rights.
Enact the Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act
(S. 417/H.R. 3856, 115th Cong., 1st Sess.) to monitor
the state of Hong Kong's autonomy from mainland China,
punish human rights violators, and reaffirm U.S.
government support for democracy in Hong Kong.
Continue to advocate for Hong Kong pro-democracy
advocates who are serving prison sentences for their
role in peaceful demonstrations, such as Chan Kin-man.
Ask Chinese authorities about the whereabouts and
condition of Hong Kong bookseller Gui Minhai, a Swedish
citizen whom Chinese authorities are holding in
arbitrary detention in mainland China.
Emphasize in meetings with Chinese and Hong Kong
officials that the continued erosion of Hong Kong's
autonomy, which is guaranteed in both the 1984 Sino-
British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law under the
``one country, two systems'' policy, threatens the
underpinnings of U.S. policy toward Hong Kong,
particularly Hong Kong's separate treatment under U.S.
law.
Urge the Chinese and Hong Kong governments to restart
the electoral reform process and work toward
implementing Chief Executive and Legislative Council
elections by universal suffrage, in accordance with
Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law and Article 25 of
the International Covenant on Civil and Political
Rights (ICCPR).
Call on the Chinese and Macau governments to set a
timeline for implementing elections in Macau for Chief
Executive and the Legislative Assembly by universal
suffrage, as required under Article 25 of the ICCPR.

Introduction: Hong Kong's Autonomy
Hong Kong's autonomy from the central government of the
People's Republic of China (PRC) under the ``one country, two
systems'' policy is defined by the 1984 Sino-British Joint
Declaration (Declaration) and the Basic Law of the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (Basic Law). In the Declaration,
the governments of the PRC and the United Kingdom agreed that
the Hong Kong government, under the ``one country, two
systems'' framework,\1\ ``will enjoy a high degree of autonomy,
except in foreign and defence affairs'' and be ``vested with
executive, legislative and independent judicial power . . ..''
\2\ The Basic Law, the constitutional document of Hong Kong,
details the implementation of social \3\ and economic \4\
systems, the protection of fundamental rights and freedoms,\5\
and the executive,\6\ legislative,\7\ and judicial systems in
Hong Kong.'' \8\ The Basic Law enshrines the provisions of the
International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR)
and the International Covenant on Economic, Social, and
Cultural Rights, and international labor conventions as they
apply to Hong Kong.\9\ The United States-Hong Kong Policy Act
of 1992 commits the United States to treating Hong Kong as a
separate customs territory from the rest of China, so long as
Hong Kong remains ``sufficiently autonomous.'' \10\ According
to the act, ``[s]upport for democratization'' is fundamental to
U.S. policy in Hong Kong \11\ and human rights ``are directly
relevant to United States interests in Hong Kong'' and ``serve
as a basis for Hong Kong's continued economic prosperity.''
\12\
Erosion of Political Autonomy in Hong Kong
During its 2019 reporting year, the Commission observed a
further erosion of Hong Kong's autonomy and fundamental
freedoms under the ``one country, two systems'' framework.\13\
Chinese government influence over the territory, and Hong Kong
officials' willingness to comply with the interests of the
Chinese government, continued an accelerated trend of decreased
autonomy observed in recent years.\14\
CHIEF EXECUTIVE ADVANCES CENTRAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES
The Chief Executive (CE) of Hong Kong pursued policies that
aligned with the interests of the Chinese central government.
There were no signs within the past year of electoral reform to
grant universal suffrage to Hong Kong people in electing the
CE.\15\ Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor was elected CE in 2017 by a
1,194-member Election Committee consisting of many members who
are widely considered to be supporters of the central
government.\16\ Lam's government promoted and implemented
policies consistent with the central government's policy
objectives this past year, especially greater economic
integration with mainland China through the new Guangzhou-
Shenzhen-Hong Kong High Speed Rail (opened in September
2018),\17\ a new Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau bridge (opened in
October 2018),\18\ and the Greater Bay Area (GBA) project
(official plan released in February 2019).\19\ The GBA project
is a central government plan to create an innovation hub for
science and technology by integrating the economic activities
of cities in Guangdong province, Macau, and Hong Kong--three
jurisdictions with separate customs, legal, and monetary
systems.\20\ One Hong Kong-based observer expressed concern
that the GBA project may negatively impact Hong Kong's
autonomy, turning it into ``just another Chinese city'' that
may not warrant special economic treatment by the United
States.\21\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
National Anthem Bill
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
After passing the PRC National Anthem Law in mainland China in
September 2017,\22\ the National People's Congress Standing Committee
(NPCSC) added the PRC National Anthem Law to Annex III of the Basic Law
of Hong Kong and Macau in November 2017,\23\ requiring the Hong Kong
and Macau governments to prepare local national anthem legislation in
accordance with the central government's law.\24\ Chinese laws do not
apply to Hong Kong except for those listed in Annex III.\25\ In January
2019, the Hong Kong government introduced the National Anthem Bill to
the Legislative Council amid concerns that the bill would stifle
freedom of expression in Hong Kong.\26\ According to the bill, those
who ``misuse'' or ``insult'' the Chinese national anthem could face a
fine of up to HK$50,000 (approximately US$6,370), imprisonment for
three years, or both.\27\ Observers said that the move by the central
government to use Annex III to insert a law unrelated to defense and
foreign affairs was ``unprecedented'' \28\ and warned that more laws
passed by the NPCSC may become applicable to Hong Kong in the
future.\29\ In June 2019, the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs
Bureau decided not to send the National Anthem Bill to its second
reading in the LegCo before the end of the legislative calendar year,
which ended in July 2019.\30\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
RESTRICTIONS ON PRO-DEMOCRACY CANDIDATES IN ELECTIONS
The Hong Kong government continued to reject the candidacy
of Legislative Council (LegCo) and local election nominees
based on their political beliefs and association. In October
2018, the Hong Kong government denied Lau Siu-lai, one of the
six elected lawmakers who lost their seats in 2016 and 2017,
from running in the November 2018 LegCo by-election for Kowloon
West, the district in which she had previously won her
seat.\31\ The election officer Franco Kwok Wai-fun cited the
High Court ruling of July 2017 that disqualified Lau from
LegCo, stating that she could not sincerely take her oath of
office.\32\ Kwok also cited Lau's past support for ``self-
determination'' in Hong Kong as a ground for
disqualification.\33\ Similarly, in December 2018, the Hong
Kong government rejected pro-democracy lawmaker Eddie Chu Hoi-
dick's nomination to run as a candidate in the village
representative election for Yuen Kong San Tsuen in Yuen Long
district, based on his past promotion of ``democratic self-
determination'' for Hong Kong.\34\ Enoch Yuen, the election
officer who invalidated Chu's nomination, said that Chu's
political stance and remarks cast doubt on whether he
``acknowledged PRC's sovereignty over [Hong Kong] and hence
whether he genuinely upheld the [Basic Law].'' \35\ The
government's rejection of certain candidates from running in
elections violates Article 21 of the Hong Kong Bill of Rights
Ordinance and Article 25 of the ICCPR guaranteeing the right
``to vote and to be elected at genuine periodic elections.''
\36\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2019 Anti-Extradition Bill and Pro-Democracy Demonstrations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Extradition Bill. The Hong Kong government formally introduced an
extradition bill in the Legislative Council (LegCo) on April 3,
2019.\37\ The proposed changes to the Fugitive Offenders Ordinance and
the Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Ordinance would allow
case-based arrangements for the extradition of suspects to
jurisdictions with which it has no extradition agreements, including
mainland China.\38\ Civil society groups,\39\ businesses,\40\
lawyers,\41\ and international human rights organizations \42\
expressed concern that the amendments would compromise the rule of law
in Hong Kong and subject the people of Hong Kong to the opaque criminal
justice system in mainland China where they could face unfair trials,
torture, and other serious human rights violations.
Widespread Protests. A series of large-scale anti-extradition bill and
pro-democracy demonstrations took place in Hong Kong beginning in late
March 2019.\43\ On June 9, an estimated 1.03 million Hong Kong people
according to organizers (240,000 according to the Hong Kong police),
participated in demonstrations against the extradition bill.\44\ On
June 12, the scheduled date of the second reading of the bill in
LegCo,\45\ tens of thousands of demonstrators surrounded government
offices in the Admiralty district of Hong Kong demanding that the
government withdraw the extradition bill from consideration.\46\ Police
officers deployed rubber bullets, tear gas, pepper spray, and a water
cannon against protesters amid clashes \47\ and Hong Kong Police
Commissioner Stephen Lo declared the protest a ``riot.'' \48\ LegCo
canceled the scheduled meeting.\49\ On June 16, a day after the
government suspended the bill from consideration,\50\ an estimated two
million people (338,000 according to the Hong Kong police) participated
in a demonstration \51\ and made five demands of the government: 1)
withdraw the extradition bill; 2) investigate police violence; 3) drop
charges against all arrested protesters; 4) retract the
characterization of the June 12 protests as a ``riot''; and 5) compel
the resignation of Chief Executive Carrie Lam.\52\ Over the following
months, anti-extradition bill protesters and groups such as
lawyers,\53\ civil servants,\54\ financial workers,\55\ airport
staff,\56\ medical professionals,\57\ teachers,\58\ and students \59\
separately organized peaceful marches,\60\ rallies,\61\ strikes,\62\
fundraising campaigns \63\ and other forms of demonstrations \64\ in
different districts in Hong Kong. Protesters expanded demands to
include the establishment of an independent commission of inquiry on
police conduct \65\ and democratic reforms toward universal suffrage in
Hong Kong's Chief Executive and LegCo elections.\66\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2019 Anti-Extradition Bill and Pro-Democracy Demonstrations--Continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Excessive Use of Force by Hong Kong Police Force. International and
Hong Kong human rights groups,\67\ journalists, and crowd-control
experts \68\ noted that the Hong Kong Police Force (HKPF) used
excessive force and inappropriately operated crowd-control equipment in
some instances during the 2019 protests. The HKPF fired projectiles
including rubber bullets, beanbag rounds, and pepper balls at close
range; \69\ launched tear gas canisters into crowded and enclosed areas
and from high buildings, did not give warning before firing tear gas,
and struck individuals with tear gas canisters; \70\ and misused batons
against protesters, causing blunt force trauma.\71\
International and local journalist associations expressed concerns
about the HKPF's treatment of journalists during protests, including
firing tear gas at reporters, physically and verbally assaulting
journalists, and conducting unjustified searches.\72\ The HKPF's use of
force contravened international standards enumerated in the United
Nations Code of Conduct for Law Enforcement Officials \73\ and the
Basic Principles on the Use of Force and Firearms for Law Enforcement
Officials,\74\ both of which require officials to avoid using force, or
where necessary, use the minimum extent of force at a proportionate
level. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights
``reviewed credible evidence of law enforcement officials employing
less-lethal weapons in ways that are prohibited by international norms
and standards,'' and urged the Hong Kong government to not only
``investigate these incidents immediately'' but also to ``act with
restraint.'' \75\
Gang Attacks and Violence. Groups of men, some confirmed to be members
of criminal syndicates with suspected links to the Chinese Communist
Party,\76\ attacked Hong Kong residents and protesters on various
occasions.\77\ Notably, on July 21, a mob armed with wooden poles,
rattan sticks, and metal pipes indiscriminately attacked residents at
the Yuen Long MTR subway station, resulting in 45 people being
hospitalized.\78\ Police officers did not arrive on scene and respond
until around 45 minutes after the attack, which prompted accusations
from observers of police apathy and collusion with the attackers.\79\
Ten days prior to the attack, an official from the Liaison Office of
the Central People's Government in Hong Kong had urged local community
leaders to ``prevent protesters from causing trouble in Yuen Long.''
\80\ Some anti-extradition bill protesters engaged in radical actions
during demonstrations, such as vandalizing government buildings,\81\
violently clashing with HKPF officers,\82\ and assaulting two
individuals identified as a public security official from mainland
China and a reporter for Global Times, a Party-run news outlet.\83\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------------------------------
2019 Anti-Extradition Bill and Pro-Democracy Demonstrations--Continued
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Selective Arrests and Prosecution. By September 1, the HKPF had
reportedly arrested more than 1,100 participants, activists, and pro-
democracy LegCo members in connection with the protests.\84\ Charges
included ``rioting,'' \85\ ``unlawful assembly,'' \86\ ``assaulting a
police officer,'' \87\ ``possessing offensive weapons,'' \88\ and other
offenses.\89\ Prosecutors, lawyers, and protesters expressed concern
that arrests and prosecution of anti-extradition bill demonstrators
were selective and politically driven.\90\ For example, in contrast to
the 23 people linked to criminal syndicates arrested in connection with
the July 21 Yuen Long attack who were charged with ``unlawful
assembly,'' hundreds of arrested demonstrators were charged with
``rioting,'' a charge carrying a punishment of up to ten years.\91\
Central Government Manipulation of the Media. The central government
employed propaganda, disinformation, and censorship in an apparent
attempt to shape reporting on the Hong Kong protests,\92\ attributing
the protests to influence by ``foreign forces,'' \93\ and signaling
threats to protesters in Hong Kong.\94\ Central government authorities
reportedly issued directives to delete or promote certain content on
all websites and news media platforms \95\ and detained and harassed
citizens in mainland China who showed support for the Hong Kong
protests on their social media accounts.\96\ The Chinese government's
restrictions on expression violate Article 19 of the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guaranteeing the right to
freedom of expression.\97\
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Government Prosecution in Hong Kong Courts
The Hong Kong government continued to pursue prosecutions
against leaders and participants of public demonstrations,
including the 2014 pro-democracy protests, also known as the
``Umbrella Movement,'' this past year.\98\
UMBRELLA MOVEMENT PROSECUTIONS
Since the end of the Umbrella Movement in 2014, the Hong
Kong government has filed 48 legal cases against 33 pro-
democracy leaders.\99\ Of these cases, 23 were brought against
16 LegCo members.\100\ From November to December 2018, nine
leaders of the Umbrella Movement (``the Umbrella Nine''), Benny
Tai Yiu-ting, Chu Yiu-ming, Chan Kin-man, Lee Wing-tat, Shiu
Ka-chun, Tanya Chan, Raphael Wong Ho-ming, Tommy Cheung Sau-
yin, and Eason Chung Yiu-wah, were tried on public nuisance-
related charges under common law, which carry up to seven years
in prison, a much heavier penalty compared to a maximum of
three months in prison under statutory law.\101\ In April 2019,
the Hong Kong District Court found all nine guilty \102\ and
sentenced Tai and Chan to one year and four months'
imprisonment \103\ and Shiu and Wong to eight months'
imprisonment.\104\ On August 15, Tai was released on bail
pending appeal.\105\
International human rights organizations and observers
warned that the charges and verdicts against the Umbrella Nine
not only infringed on the rights of Hong Kong people to the
freedom of assembly and expression,\106\ but also serve as
precedent to prosecute other Umbrella Movement participants and
pro-democracy protesters.\107\ Sophie Richardson, China
Director at Human Rights Watch, said that prosecutions against
pro-democracy leaders ``raise further questions about Hong Kong
authorities' moves to politicize the courts.'' \108\ The Hong
Kong-based Progressive Lawyers Group assessed in a report that,
``the resort to criminal proceedings to criminalize the pro-
democracy movement to an unprecedented extent in Hong Kong has
given rise to serious concerns of political persecution through
prosecution.'' \109\
PROSECUTIONS AGAINST PARTICIPANTS IN THE NOVEMBER 2016 PROTESTS
The Hong Kong government continued prosecuting nine leaders
of the November 2016 demonstrations against the central
government's National People's Congress Standing Committee
(NPCSC) interpretation of the Basic Law,\110\ which requires
public officials to take their oaths ``sincerely'' and
``solemnly.'' \111\ The central government issued the
interpretation while a Hong Kong court was considering the Hong
Kong government's case against legislators-elect Sixtus
``Baggio'' Leung and Yau Wai-ching, who altered their oaths
during an oath-taking ceremony in October 2016.\112\ Nine
leaders and participants in the demonstrations, including Avery
Ng Man-yuen, Dickson Chau Ka Fat, Sammy Yip Chi Hin, Chan Man
Wai, Lo Tak Cheong, Cheng Pui Lun, Chow Shu Wing, Derek Lam,
and Ivan Lam, were tried on a variety of charges such as
``inciting unlawful assembly,'' ``unlawful assembly,''
``obstructing police,'' and ``assaulting police'' from July to
November 2018.\113\ In May 2019, a court found six out of nine
guilty in connection with their roles in the protests.\114\
Fundamental Freedoms
The Hong Kong government continued to violate fundamental
freedoms enshrined in the Basic Law this past year. The central
government's interference in Hong Kong's political affairs, and
the Hong Kong government's limitations on the freedoms of
expression, association, and assembly, raised alarms among
foreign governments,\115\ local groups,\116\ and international
human rights organizations.\117\
Hong Kong Designated as ``Partly Free.''
Freedom House's 2019 Freedom in the World report,
citing the lack of universal suffrage in the electoral
process and limitations to civil and political rights,
rated Hong Kong as ``partly free'' with a score of 59
out of 100 in its aggregate freedom score (100 being
``most free'').\118\ In the 2019 World Press Freedom
Index by Reporters Without Borders, Hong Kong's press
freedom ranking fell three places to 73 out of 180
territories assessed.\119\ The Hong Kong Journalists
Association's surveys on press freedom in 2018 found
that public perception of press freedom in Hong Kong
was at an all-time low, while journalists perceived the
central government's interference in Hong Kong to be
the major contributing factor in the erosion of press
freedom.\120\
Government Ban of Hong Kong National Party. On
September 24, 2018, the Hong Kong Secretary for
Security officially banned the Hong Kong National Party
(HKNP), a small pro-independence political party,\121\
by applying a provision in the Societies Ordinance
\122\--a British colonial-era law intended to prohibit
organizations like the Chinese Communist Party and the
Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) \123\--that allows the
prohibition of a group on grounds related to ``national
security'' and ``public safety.'' \124\ According to
U.K.-based human rights organization Hong Kong Watch,
the Societies Ordinance places ``excessive restrictions
on freedom of expression and association'' against the
government's political opposition and should be revised
to better define what constitutes a ``national security
threat.'' \125\
Government Denial of Victor Mallet's Visa
Renewal. In October 2018, Hong Kong authorities denied
the visa renewal request of Financial Times Asia editor
Victor Mallet,\126\ sparking an international outcry
regarding the increasingly restrictive press
environment in Hong Kong and the negative implications
for foreign journalists working in the city.\127\
Reports tied the rejection to Mallet's role as the vice
president of the Foreign Correspondent's Club of Hong
Kong (FCCHK) in hosting an event months earlier, which
featured Andy Chan, pro-independence advocate, founder
of the HKNP, and critic of the central government in
mainland China.\128\ Human rights organizations
condemned the Hong Kong government's treatment of
Mallet as retaliation for facilitating the FCCHK
event.\129\
Increased Pressure on Artists, Writers, and
Singers. Freedom of expression in Hong Kong's
entertainment and creative arts sectors came under
pressure in the past year. In November 2018, organizers
Hong Kong Free Press, Amnesty International, and
Reporters Without Borders canceled a show in Hong Kong
featuring dissident artist Badiucao, an Australian
cartoonist of Chinese descent, over ``safety concerns''
after authorities from the central government
reportedly made threats against the artist.\130\ In the
same month, the Tai Kwun Center for Heritage and Arts
in Hong Kong reportedly canceled two events featuring
Chinese dissident novelist Ma Jian, but later reversed
the decision and hosted Ma as originally
scheduled.\131\ Reports in April 2019 revealed that
Apple Music's mainland China services removed a song by
pop star Jacky Cheung with references to the 1989
Tiananmen protests and songs by Hong Kong singers
Denise Ho and Anthony Wong, who were supporters of the
2014 pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong.\132\
Macau
Macau's Basic Law does not provide for elections by
``universal suffrage,'' \133\ although its provisions ensure
the applicability of the International Covenant on Civil and
Political Rights (ICCPR) in Macau \134\ and guarantee Macau a
``high degree of autonomy'' within China.\135\ During its 2019
reporting year, the Commission did not observe progress in
Macau toward universal suffrage in the 2019 Chief Executive
(CE) election.\136\ Former Macau Legislative Assembly president
Ho Iat Seng--running as the only candidate--won the CE election
on August 25, 2019.\137\ Ho received 392 out of 400 possible
votes from the CE Election Committee, many of whose members are
considered to be supporters of the central government.\138\
This past year, the Macau government continued to
``securitize'' the city against pro-democracy forces that might
challenge the central government's rule. In September 2018, the
government established a new National Defense Commission to
``[safeguard] national security'' and assess the city's broader
``social stability'' out of concerns regarding pro-independence
advocacy in Hong Kong.\139\ In October 2018, the Macau
Legislative Assembly (AL) approved the government's plans for a
Cybersecurity Bill, which critics said would undermine freedom
of expression in the city and allow the Macau government to
``monitor, sensor, block and delete online speech.'' \140\ In
June 2019, the AL passed the Cybersecurity Bill into law,\141\
effective December 2019.\142\
In January 2019, the AL passed an amendment to the Macau
Special Administrative Region's 1999 National Anthem Law
(effective June 2019), making acts disrespectful of the Chinese
national anthem punishable by up to three years in prison.\143\
Three pro-democracy legislators voted against the bill, in
particular citing their opposition to the provision that some
interpret as requiring local media outlets to assist the
government in carrying out ``promotion'' (xuanchuan) campaigns
for the national anthem.\144\ The Macau Journalists Association
also opposed the same provision, declaring that the media is
not ``the propaganda machine of the regime, and it has no
obligation to cooperate.'' \145\
