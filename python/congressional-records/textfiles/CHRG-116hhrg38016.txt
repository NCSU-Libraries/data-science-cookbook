OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. ABIGAIL DAVIS SPANBERGER, A
REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM VIRGINIA
The Chair. This hearing of the Subcommittee on Conservation
and Forestry entitled, The National Forest System: Restoring
our Forest Infrastructure, will come to order.
Good morning. I would like to welcome everyone to this
hearing of the Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee on the
National Forest System: restoring our forest infrastructure, a
critically important topic. I would also like to thank Ranking
Member LaMalfa, who will be arriving shortly, for his
engagement on this issue, as well as each Subcommittee Member
for taking part in this hearing today.
The roads, trails, bridges, dams, and other facilities that
make up our National Forest infrastructure help ensure safe and
reliable access to natural resources and serve as an essential
backbone for our economic activity.
More than 140 million Americans visit National Forest lands
every year to camp, hike, fish, hunt, ski, and more. Recreation
on and around Forest Service land contributes more than $10
billion to the U.S. economy every year and supports more than
143,000 full-time and part-time American jobs.
In addition to recreation, 66 million Americans in over
3,000 communities depend on Forest Service infrastructure for
drinking water and wastewater services and many communities
rely on Forest Service roads to drive their children to school;
shop in neighborhood stores; and visit their doctors.
However, as a consequence of deferring maintenance across
the agency's infrastructure portfolio, our forest
infrastructure is in disrepair, and no longer meets the needs
of forest users, local communities, and emergency responders.
As is the case with all Federal land management agencies,
appropriated funds have so far been insufficient.
With the deferred maintenance backlog of $5.2 billion, the
ability of the American public to safely access and benefit
from National Forests is greatly diminished. As many of our
Subcommittee Members know all too well, one contributing factor
to this acute backlog has been soaring fire suppression costs.
The increasing frequency and intensity of wildfires has forced
the agency to make some tough decisions, often pulling funds
from non-fire accounts to address wildfires, and leaving fewer
and fewer resources to support other aspects of the agency's
work, like deferred maintenance. We hope that the fire fix that
goes into effect in Fiscal Year 2020 helps address this part of
the deferred maintenance challenge.
Despite the challenges of aging infrastructure, the
dedicated public servants at the Forest Service have
continually worked to do more with less, and to deliver upon
their mission: to sustain the health, diversity, and
productivity of the nation's forests and grasslands to meet the
needs of present and future generations.
Proper maintenance of our National Forests is a matter of
safety and economic well-being. I hope this hearing will help
us better understand the severity of the deferred maintenance
backlog, its impact on regional economies, and the agency's
future plans for capital improvement.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Spanberger follows:]
Prepared Statement of Hon. Abigail Davis Spanberger, a Representative
in Congress from Virginia
Good morning, I would like to welcome everyone to this hearing of
the Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee on The National Forest
System: Restoring Our Forest Infrastructure, a critically important
topic. I would also like to thank Ranking Member LaMalfa for his
engagement on this issue, as well as each Subcommittee Member for
taking part in this hearing today.
National Forest infrastructure is the physical link to the
outdoors. Its network of roads, trails, bridges, dams, and facilities
helps ensure access to natural resources and secure the economic well-
being of neighboring communities.
Over 140 million Americans visit National Forest lands year-round
to camp, hike, fish, hunt, ski and snowboard, and take part in a wide
range of other recreation. Recreation on and around Forest Service land
contributes more than $10 billion to the U.S. economy every year and
supports more than 143,000 full and part-time jobs.
66 million Americans in over 3,000 communities depend on Forest
Service infrastructure for drinking water and wastewater services.
Similarly, many communities rely on Forest Service roads to drive their
children to school; shop in neighborhood stores; or visit their doctor,
among other routine travel needs. Over the last 2 decades alone,
community development along the Wildland-Urban Interface has expanded
by more than 46 million acres, an area larger than the State of
Washington.
However, as a consequence of deferring maintenance in the agency's
infrastructure portfolio, the state of our forest infrastructure has
fallen far behind what is necessary to meet the needs of forest users,
local communities, and emergency responders. As is the case with all
Federal land management agencies, appropriated funds have been
insufficient to adequately maintain roads, trails, bridges, dams, and
other important structures.
Over the last few decades, fire suppression costs have increased as
the frequency and intensity of wildfires have also increased. These
escalating costs have forced the agency to make some tough decisions,
often pulling funds from non-fire accounts to address wildfires and
leaving fewer and fewer resources to support other aspects of the
agency's work, like deferred maintenance. We hope that the fire budget
fix that goes into effect in FY20 solves that component of this issue.
With a deferred maintenance backlog of $5.2 billion, the ability of the
American public to safely access and benefit from National Forests is
greatly diminished.
Despite the challenges of aging infrastructure, the Forest Service
has continually worked to do more with less and has charged itself to
develop a long-term plan to deliver upon its mission to ``sustain the
health, diversity, and productivity of the nation's forests and
grasslands to meet the needs of present and future generations.''
Proper maintenance of our National Forests is a matter of safety
and economic well-being. I hope this hearing will help us better
understand the severity of the deferred maintenance backlog, its impact
on regional economies, and the agency's future plans for capital
improvement.
This is the important subject of our hearing today, to better
understand the level of deferred maintenance; its impact on economic
opportunity and public use; and to examine agency plans for capital
improvement.
The Chair. With that, I will recognize the Ranking Member
once he has arrived. But in consultation with the Ranking
Member and pursuant to Rule XI(e), I want to make Members of
the Subcommittee aware that other Members of the full Committee
may join us today.
The chair would request that other Members submit their
opening statements for the record so the witness may begin her
testimony, and to ensure there is ample time for questions
today.
I would like to welcome our witness, Ms. Lenise Lago,
Associate Chief for the U.S. Forest Service. In coordination
with the Chief, Ms. Lago helps lead a workforce of more than
28,000 year-round employees, and an additional 12,000 seasonal
employees, and is a steward to 193 million acres of National
Forests and Grasslands.
Ms. Lago worked briefly in the forest products industry
before joining the Forest Service in 1989. She has worked in a
variety of planning, budget, and resource management jobs,
splitting time between Washington, D.C., and the western United
States, including Montana, Washington, and Oregon.
Associate Chief Lago is a native of Athens, Georgia, and a
graduate of the University of Georgia's Warnell School of
Forest Resources.
Ms. Lago, you will have 5 minutes to present your
testimony. The light will turn yellow, signaling when you have
1 minute left to complete your testimony. Please begin when you
are ready.
STATEMENT OF LENISE LAGO, ASSOCIATE CHIEF, U.S. FOREST SERVICE,
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE,
WASHINGTON, D.C.
Ms. Lago. Thank you, Madam Chair, Ranking Member LaMalfa,
and Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting me to
share the Administration's views on infrastructure within
USDA's Forest Service. I want to thank and acknowledge how
important this opportunity is to testify on this important
topic. I would also like to thank you for the support you have
given us to carry out our programs.
Infrastructure is the physical link between Americans and
their public lands, and Forest Service infrastructure is vital
to rural and urban communities alike. It includes roads,
trails, bridges, visitor centers used by the public, as well as
offices, air tanker bases, employee housing, water and
wastewater systems which we use to manage and protect all of
the other resources. People depend on a safe Forest Service
road network to get to schools, to hospitals, homes, stores.
The road system is also critical to carrying out active
management to improve forest conditions.
Infrastructure drives the economic benefits communities
derive from National Forests. The Forest Service provides the
most diverse recreation opportunities in the nation, across
world-class landscapes that attract, as you mentioned, Madam
Chair, over 140 million visitors annually, contributes $10
billion to the U.S. economy each year, and supports over
140,000 jobs, mostly in gateway and rural communities. Outdoor
recreation and tourism are the single greatest source of jobs
for local economies in the National Forest System.
Perhaps most critically, forest infrastructure provides
fire protection for communities. Firefighters and emergency
responders use forest infrastructure to access forest lands for
firefighting operations, to protect communities, to evacuate
families from areas at risk, and to rescue individuals from
danger.
Of specific interest here today is deferred maintenance,
and my written testimony includes tables listing various assets
the Forest Service owns and maintains, and the deferred
maintenance by asset category. I am not going to cite all that
here, but just to roughly identify the portfolio that we are
talking about, the Forest Service maintains over 370,000 miles
of roads. That includes over 6,000 bridges. We have 158,000
miles of trail, including over 7,000 trail bridges. We have
almost 40,000 buildings of all types, including administrative
buildings, research buildings, employee housing, and recreation
sites.
I think you know; deferred maintenance is scheduled
maintenance that doesn't get done. It has a dollar value, and
the dollar value accumulates over time. As a result of deferred
maintenance, the state of the Forest Service infrastructure has
fallen far behind what is necessary to meet the needs of our
forests and our forest users.
Today, the Forest Service has a deferred maintenance
backlog of more than $5.2 billion. Our capital improvement
budget has not kept up with needed maintenance. The President's
budget request for Fiscal Year 2020 includes a public land
infrastructure fund, which allocates monies for deferred
maintenance in the National Forest System.
Another funding source for Forest Service infrastructure
comes from the Federal Highway Administration Federal Lands
Transportation Program. Interestingly, while the Forest Service
has more miles of publicly accessible road and many times more
bridges than other Federal land management agencies, the Forest
Service receives only about five percent of the funding from
this program.
In addition to funding, the agency is doing its part to
reduce deferred maintenance. We are taking bold steps to
streamline our environmental review process and speed up
important work that could protect communities, livelihoods, and
resources. We are using tools provided by Congress as well. We
have continued to use conveyance authority, which allows us to
sell facilities that are no longer needed, and keep the
proceeds to address other infrastructure needs. We just
proposed a rulemaking for the Powerline Utility Corridor
Authority from the 2018 appropriations bill, and the
Communication Sites Authority from the 2018 Farm Bill, in
addition to the Leasing Authority, which was included in the
2018 Farm Bill.
FLREA, the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act, has
enabled us to keep up with needed maintenance at heavily-used
developed recreation sites across the country.
So, with funding, innovation, efficiency, and partnerships,
those are the keys to taking care of these important assets.
Managing a healthy infrastructure is an important part of our
job, and it supports our ability to carry out our mission.
Again, I am deeply grateful to the Committee for this
opportunity to talk about our infrastructure, to share ideas
about how to improve our backlog of deferred maintenance, and
we appreciate your support. I am happy to answer any questions.
Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Lenise Lago, Associate Chief, U.S. Forest
Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D.C.
Regarding Infrastructure on National Forest System Lands
Madam Chair and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting
me to share the Administration's position on deferred maintenance
within the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Forest Service.
On the National Forest System, infrastructure is the physical link
between Americans and their public lands. It strengthens communities by
giving them safe access to the many ecological, economic, and social
amenities these lands provide. For instance, people use infrastructure
on the National Forest System for ranching, farming, logging, outdoor
recreation, tourism, and municipal water services, all of which support
thriving small businesses, particularly in local communities. People
depend on the Forest Service road network to get to schools, stores,
hospitals, and homes. Perhaps most critically, forest infrastructure
provides fire protection for communities. Firefighters and emergency
responders use forest infrastructure to access forest lands for
firefighting operations to protect communities, evacuate families from
areas at risk, and rescue individuals from danger.
The infrastructure on the National Forest System includes over
370,000 miles of road, 13,400 bridges and trail bridges (see table 1),
158,000 miles of trail, nearly 500 Forest Service owned dams, over
1,100 privately owned dams overseen by the Forest Service, and
facilities for both administration and wildland fire management. The
roads, bridges, facilities, and other infrastructure affect every
aspect of the Forest Service mission and are critical to the effective
management of National Forests and Grasslands on behalf of the American
public.
However, as a consequence of deferring maintenance in our extensive
infrastructure portfolio, the state of the Forest Service's
infrastructure has fallen far behind what is necessary to meet the
needs of our forests and forest users. Today, the Forest Service has a
deferred maintenance \1\ backlog of more than $5.2 billion (table 3--
Deferred Maintenance Backlog; data is also available by state).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ ``Deferred maintenance'' is the continual delay of maintenance
of Forest Service infrastructure assets. Deferred maintenance prevents
buildings, roads, bridges, and other assets from reaching their
expected useful lifespans. The total dollar value of deferred
maintenance is determined by totaling all of the work items of
components and systems that need to be repaired or replaced. It does
not include unforeseen failures such as a boiler leak, or a wash out of
a road or bridge by a storm, etc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The President's Budget for Fiscal Year 2020 includes a Public Lands
Infrastructure Fund allocating monies for deferred maintenance on the
National Forest System. USDA welcomes the opportunity for further
discussion with the Subcommittee regarding the proposed fund to meet
the Forest Service's deferred maintenance needs.
Our infrastructure needs are pressing, and neglecting to meet them
only makes the problem worse. Neglecting routine maintenance turns
minor repairs into major-overhaul work. Ultimately, if left unchecked,
it can turn critical infrastructure unusable to the point of requiring
full replacement. Every delay expands deferred maintenance beyond the
Forest Service's ability to maintain our infrastructure and keep up
with vital services such as fire suppression, timber production, and
outdoor recreation.
Infrastructure on the National Forests and Grasslands also supports
a rising demand for outdoor recreation. The Forest Service provides
recreation opportunities in the nation across landscapes that attract
over 149 million visitors annually. According to the National Visitor
Use Monitoring (NVUM) program, through both direct and ripple effects,
National Forest visitor spending contributes over $10 billion to the
U.S. economy each year while supporting about 143,000 jobs, mostly in
gateway and rural communities. Outdoor recreation and tourism are the
single greatest source of jobs on the National Forest System.
Forest roads and bridges are critical for sustaining landscapes
across the 193 million acres of National Forest System lands for the
benefit of visitors and communities; wildland fire management also
requires an extensive system of forest roads and bridges in good
condition. However, the backlog of deferred maintenance for forest
roads and bridges is $3.4 billion--needed maintenance and repairs
delayed until some future time.
One example of deferred maintenance impacts to Forest Service
assets is the Longhouse Scenic Drive road system on the Allegh[e]ny
National Forest in Pennsylvania. Wear and tear on the road is exceeding
the ability for most passenger cars to reasonably travel over it.
Without needed repairs, the road system cannot bring visitors from
across the country to enjoy the National Forest and sustain local
businesses through their spending. Each year, users of the road system
spend about $1.5 million at local businesses.

The Forest Service supports outdoor recreation at more than 29,000
recreation sites ranging from highly developed campgrounds, target
ranges, and boating areas to minimally developed trailheads and fishing
areas. Many of these sites, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps,
are more than 75 years old and remain in use far beyond their expected
lifespans. The deterioration of this recreation infrastructure has a
direct impact on all forest users including outfitters and guides who
create jobs in forest communities and utilize recreation infrastructure
for activities such as fishing and river rafting in National Forests.
Unless the Forest Service invests in recreation infrastructure, the
quality of visitor experience will suffer and local businesses who
depend on forest visitors for their livelihoods might fail.
The Forest Service manages over 158,000 miles of trails--the
largest managed system of trails in the country. These trails provide
motorized and nonmotorized access and high-quality recreation
opportunities across the National Forest System, benefiting economies
and human health in communities nationwide while also fostering
extensive volunteerism and citizen stewardship. Only about 25 percent
of these trails meet agency standards for safety and quality. Total
maintenance across the trail system is estimated at over $600 million,
$300 million in deferred maintenance and $300 million in annual
operational maintenance.
The Forest Service uses 40,510 USDA-owned buildings for
administrative and other purposes (table 2). The buildings include
facilities for research and wildland fire management as well as visitor
centers, bathrooms, communications towers, living quarters, and
warehouses. The Forest Service's deferred maintenance backlog for
facilities totals $1.2 billion, about 65 percent of which is for
buildings older than 50 years. Due to both age and deferred
maintenance, only 57 percent of the buildings used by the Forest
Service are up to standard.
The agency is taking a number of actions to help reduce deferred
maintenance. For example, the Forest Service approach to travel
management helps forests plan a road system that best meets community
needs and transfers ownership to local communities, counties, or states
where appropriate. In West Virginia, Monongahela National Forest, Red
Creek Bridge at Laneville accesses 100 structures, including camps,
cabins, permanent residences, mail route, etc. This bridge also
accesses the Dolly Sods Wilderness, an eastern recreation destination
and economic generator. The Red Creek bridge structure has been
identified for much needed, significant, repairs for the past 10 years.

The agency is doing its part to reduce deferred maintenance. We are
taking bold steps to streamline our environmental review processes and
speed up important work that could help protect communities,
livelihoods and resources. The proposed updates would not only give the
Forest Service the tools and flexibility to manage the land and tackle
critical challenges like wildfire, insects, and disease but also
improve service to the American people. Revising the rules will improve
forest conditions and make it simpler for people to use and enjoy their
National Forests and Grasslands at lower cost to the taxpayer. The
revised rules will also make it easier to maintain and repair the
infrastructure people need to use and enjoy their public lands--the
roads, trails, campgrounds, and other facilities.
The updates will help reduce our maintenance backlog by
implementing a new suite of ``categorical exclusions,'' a
classification under NEPA excluding certain routine activities from
more extensive, time-consuming environmental impact analyses. The
proposed categorical exclusions would be for restoration projects,
roads and trails management, recreation and facility management, as
well as special use authorizations that issue permits for outfitters
and guides, community organizations, civic groups and others who seek
to recreate on our National Forests and Grasslands. The new categorical
exclusions are based on intensive analysis of hundreds of environmental
assessments and related data and, when fully implemented, will reduce
process delays for routine activities by months or years. We are also
streamlining our business practices and implementing new programmatic
agreements for consultation with other agencies.
For example, this agency is specifically streamlining business
practices to reduce deferred maintenance by strategically prioritizing
capital improvement projects. For road projects, the agency uses the
following criteria in order: (a) projects vital for near-term forest-
based economic activity (that is, restoration within the next 5 years);
(b) projects needed for safety; (c) projects that improve access to
recreation sites and trails; and (d) projects that improve wildlife
connectivity, aquatic organism passage, and flood resiliency. Projects
are evaluated based on how they can provide support and infrastructure
necessary to accomplish national Forest Service goals and mission
areas. The goals are better community service and better access to
public lands for emergency response, outdoor recreation, and active
resource management. Projects are also evaluated on how they use
partnerships to achieve mutual conservation goals through combined
efforts.
Primary funding for Forest Service infrastructure comes from both
Forest Service appropriations and from the Federal Highway
Administration's Federal Lands Transportation Program (FLTP). Adjusted
for inflation, appropriated resources have been decreasing over the
past 2 decades, notwithstanding a spike in funding for roads in 2010
under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The Fixing America's
Surface Transportation Act of 2015 authorized a total of $85 million in
FLTP program funding for the agency for Fiscal Years 2016-2020. This
amount derives from the Highway Trust Fund.
With more than $5.2 billion in deferred maintenance, the Forest
Service cannot keep much of its infrastructure on the National Forest
System from deteriorating. A deteriorating infrastructure keeps us from
properly managing the National Forest System. With roads in poor
condition, for example, emergency vehicles have trouble getting to
wildfires, undermining our firefighting and rescue capabilities.
Conversely, by reducing deferred maintenance and improving
infrastructure, the Forest Service would be better able to protect
communities from wildfire, in part through projects to reduce hazardous
fuels through prescribed fire and mechanical treatments. In addition,
visitors would get better access to recreational activities and the
Forest Service would become a better neighbor by offering more
opportunities for jobs and economic activity in rural areas.
The Forest Service is eager to work with the Committee to meet our
infrastructure needs and reduce our deferred maintenance backlog. We
are deeply committed to accomplishing our multiple-use goals for
National Forest System lands, goals enshrined in our mission and in the
laws of the United States, in accordance with the needs and desires of
the people we serve.

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DOUG LaMALFA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM CALIFORNIA
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you, Madam Chair, and I have no excuse
for my tardiness, but I did bring a forest green pen today, if
there is any redeeming value to that.
So, thank you, and thank you for joining with us, Associate
Chief Lago.
As we know, the National Forest System created more than
100 years ago, designed--and this is an important key point--
for multiple uses for the surrounding communities. And so, it
is a vast network, 193 million acres of public land, and much
of the infrastructure, like we hear with our National Park
System, is aging and requires regular upkeep, which hasn't been
quite regular. We have budget challenges, such as fire
borrowing, loss of revenue due to declining timber harvests,
all contributing to the backlog we are talking about.
A significant portion of the backlog, nearly 75 percent, is
maintenance of the 370,000 mile road system within our forests,
a lot of that in California, my home state. Of course, the
maintenance of these forest roads cannot be understated, and
they provide access to the public for access to their lands,
recreation, resources. They connect our communities and are
very important for our firefighters, of which we suffer a lot
of fire in the West lately.
Congress has worked to provide several solutions to address
the deferred maintenance, such as providing the fire funding
fix in the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018 to prevent
fire borrowing, something we are all happy about, from other
accounts, including those accounts used for National Forest
roads. The 2018 Farm Bill provided more tools for the Forest
Service, with management of forest lands, and allows more
partners to assist them in these activities. The House-passed
version of the farm bill also contained several provisions that
would have strengthened these goals, including several
categorical exclusions that would have addressed bureaucratic
red tape that has hindered the Forest Service from addressing
many of the maintenance issues we will be talking about today.
Unfortunately, that version did not make it through the
Senate last year. Earlier this year, though, the Forest Service
announced they were working on streamlining environmental
analyses. I believe it is common sense that current facilities
should be able to be improved without wasting significant time
and money due to unnecessary hurdles.
The Forest Service has recently completed a comprehensive
capital improvement plan also that we hope can be a strategy to
help address this maintenance backlog, and get back to a
healthy and sustainable functioning forest system.
Again, Associate Chief Lago, we appreciate your being here
today, and look forward to the dialogue and Q&A.
So, thank you, and I appreciate it, Madam Chair. I yield
back.
The Chair. Members will be recognized for questioning in
order of seniority for Members who were here at the start of
the hearing. After that, Members will be recognized in the
order of their arrival.
I first recognize myself for 5 minutes.
Associate Chief Lago, in your written testimony, you
mention the Forest Service currently has a deferred maintenance
backlog of more than $5.2 billion. Can you speak to the
backlog's impact on local economies, including recreational
outfitters and other small businesses that serve locals and
visitors alike? Additionally, please discuss the impact on
local small businesses that would complete some of the
infrastructure work on projects such as building and
maintaining roads?
Ms. Lago. Certainly. Thank you, Madam Chair.
The condition of deteriorated infrastructure means we can't
provide a full season of use to many users of National Forest
lands. You mentioned outfitter guides, campground operators.
Just to bring it down to the operator level, an outfitter and
guide needs road access, typically some parking lots, uses
campgrounds sometimes, boat launches. When we can't keep those
open or when we have to restrict the season of use, that means
that outfitter and guide has to reduce their season days. It
has a direct economic effect on that outfitter and guide.
It is the same with a campground. A campground operator is
charging a fee, and we can't maintain the water system so we
have to shut the water off to that campground. They can still
have campers, but they have to provide their own water. It
degrades the experience for campers, and they are less likely
to go to that campground. Again, a direct economic hit to a
service provider.
How increasing our maintenance affects local economies is
for the most part, that deferred maintenance is carried out by
contractors, partners, service providers in those local
communities.
The Chair. Thank you, and I do have a second question with
a little bit of a personal bit to it.
I have been a Girl Scout leader for the past 5 years, and I
have seen the importance of scouting and the role that the
outdoors play in the lives of young women and in boys who
participate in Boy Scouts. And events like the upcoming Hike-a-
palooza in George Washington National Forest not only provides
young women with the opportunity to explore the outdoors, but
also promotes environmental stewardship and provides exposure
to careers in conservation.
The Forest Service's ability to maintain its infrastructure
is central to ensuring that the future generations are invested
in conservation and have the opportunity to enjoy our country's
stunning public lands.
On the topic of environmental stewardship, I understand the
Forest Service relies on partnerships and volunteers, in
addition to Federal funding. Can you tell us about some of
these cooperative agreements, and how they help maintain safe,
accessible trails in places like the George Washington National
Forest?
Ms. Lago. Sure. Thank you for that.
Just generally speaking, the total value of our
partnerships and agreements is over $1 billion annually, and
more than half of that is contributed by the partner.
Within the volunteer service hours that we rack up, trails
work represents the majority of that work. We have people
volunteering to do trail maintenance that is more than 1.5
billion hours annually. That is more than 800 full-time
equivalents, and they help us maintain over 30,000 miles of
trail a year.
And in your local forest, the G.W. Jeff, we have more than
50 cooperators on trails projects. I think last year they
helped us maintain almost 5,000 miles of trail. We have
partnerships with student conservation organizations, back
country horsemen, lots of partnerships interested in helping us
maintain that infrastructure.
The Chair. Thank you very much. I appreciate your answering
my questions, and I would now recognize Ranking Member LaMalfa
for his questions.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you again, Assistant Chief.
We are talking about--and you mentioned in your comments a
$5.2 billion maintenance backlog, and that has been a number
that seems to be frozen for quite a few years, going back as
far as 2012. Which if you look at inflation costs alone, but
then obviously we have had some big events there in many of our
forests with large fires, runoff, record levels of snow pack,
and flooding, et cetera. And we know, we hear about it from our
forest people out there about considerable damage to the roads,
trails, et cetera, culverts.
But the dollar figure has stayed the same since 2012, so it
makes me wonder, is there really some type of system as to how
the Forest Service is monitoring, cataloging the damage to the
various pieces of infrastructure in the forests to see that we
are actually keeping up with the real number on the maintenance
backlog that we are talking about.
Again, we know that there is a huge number for our National
Parks, and I am wondering is there a system in place that we
could be improving or one that you are working on to get what
probably needs to be a more accurate number?
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir. So it is, first of all, a big number,
and as I described, our totality of infrastructure is big,
diverse, spread out, and inaccessible.
The way we arrive at that number is we do sampling on an
annual basis. We sample a portion of the roads, and then
calculate an estimate. We sample buildings and dams on a 5 year
cycle, dams on a 2 year cycle.
But in addition, events like fires and floods can take out
bridges. Sometimes we don't replace them, so that removes the
asset and it removes the deferred maintenance along with it.
We are doing lands transactions every year, and we may
convey an asset with a deferred maintenance, and thus reduce
it.
Mr. LaMalfa. So, with the loss of a bridge in a situation
like that, you can take it off the books because it doesn't
exist anymore.
Now on my farm, if one of my tractors catches fire, I don't
get just to write of the asset. I still need that amount of
tractor power to be able to get over the acres I do in a year.
How is this going to be serving the people in the area,
whether it is for firefighters, access, logging, whatever it
is? How can we just write that asset off?
Ms. Lago. It depends on the local area, and a lot of these
assets are legacies from many, many years ago. It might be in a
portion of the forest where access has been terminated or is
seasonally closed, and we may decide not to replace that bridge
in-kind, but do some sort of lower scale, more like a trail
bridge or something like that.
Mr. LaMalfa. Is it done in conjunction with local needs,
with local--whether it is safety officials or logging or
access, or is that decision made in D.C.? Is it made by the
local forester? I mean, that is kind of disturbing to me that
we can just write this off and maybe not have the input. How is
that done?
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir. It is a local decision. It is done with
public input, environmental analysis, and disclosure.
Mr. LaMalfa. Okay. So timber receipts have been down. Back
years ago, we are looking at 1991, we could see that there is
$680 million in timber receipts, of which ten percent goes
directly towards forest roads, and it is also very important,
those receipts, for local schools and roads under what is the
Secure Rural Schools Fund. And so, now you want $680 million in
receipts, and more recently, it is down to $21 million. It
would seem to me we could be going farther if we had the timber
receipts for the road maintenance for that ten percent.
Would you comment upon that?
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir. In recent years, we have been
increasing our timber sales. Those receipts are increasing as a
result of that, and so----
Mr. LaMalfa. Do you know that number now compared to the
$680 million not-inflation-adjusted 1991 number?
Ms. Lago. I don't know the total revenue, but I believe our
timber receipts--I will have to get back to you. No, I don't.
Mr. LaMalfa. Okay, please do.
With them down significantly, and since recreation is a
primary driver of road use; how much is being done to boost
what is coming in on recreation fees, not by just raising the
fees, but actually having more access in order to keep from
losing more roads to deterioration?
Ms. Lago. Our annual recreation fee collection is about
$100 million. Eighty-five percent of that goes back to the site
where it was generated, and the decision about fees for
recreation use is on a site-by-site basis.
Mr. LaMalfa. I mean, as far as boosting the amount of
recreation happening, is that a part of the strategy?
Ms. Lago. On an individual site basis, the local management
can and does suggest a fee increase, or to add an additional
site into the fee revenue program.
Mr. LaMalfa. Yes. I am not angling for fee increases, but
just more access where it is possible.
So, I am over time. I will yield back, Madam Chair.
The Chair. I now recognize the gentlewoman from Ohio, for 5
minutes.
Ms. Fudge. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you, Chief
Lago, for being here this morning.
I want to change the subject a bit to Job Corps, if we
could just talk about that for a bit. The Job Corps Civilian
Conservation Centers in particular.
We know that last year almost 2,000 Job Corps students from
under-served communities contributed more than 100,000 hours to
infrastructure improvements and to maintenance projects. Tell
me what you see as the opportunity to grow that program?
Ms. Lago. Yes, ma'am. Thank you.
Just this week, Secretary of Agriculture Perdue traveled to
Denver, national Job Corps headquarters, and met with our Job
Corps leadership, several center directors, and laid out a plan
for a more formal program between National Forests and the Job
Corps centers where they reside to have more students doing
restoration and maintenance work on Forest Service facilities,
more conservation-related trades at Job Corps centers, and
ultimately, more hiring of Job Corps graduates into Forest
Service jobs.
Ms. Fudge. If I understand you correctly then, USDA is
supportive of the program, wants to keep the program, and is
going to try to broaden the program?
Ms. Lago. Yes, ma'am.
Ms. Fudge. Good.
Let me also ask, do the students who participate in this
program have any path toward becoming employed with the Forest
Service or some other land management agency?
Ms. Lago. Yes, ma'am. We currently have an authority called
Public Land Corps Authority, which Job Corps students qualify
for by doing certain number of hours of restoration work on
public land. They are still required to compete for jobs in an
open merit application.
What we would like to do is work with OPM on a direct hire
authority for Job Corps graduates.
Ms. Fudge. Can you tell me just for maybe some of my
colleagues' benefit who are not familiar with the program, how
has this program helped the agency?
Ms. Lago. Well, you said it yourself. More than 2,000
students and 100,000 hours on projects doing restoration work
in National Forests.
In addition to those numbers, we have upwards of 300,000
students annually supporting firefighting, either doing things
like mobile cooking camps, or actually being on the fire line.
About, ten of our 24 centers have conservation trades. You
know, the typical trade at Job Corps is carpentry, masonry,
plumbing, painting, auto mechanics. We have ten centers where
we have forestry-related trades, and we would like to expand
the conservation trades to all of our centers.
Ms. Fudge. Well, I just appreciate the fact that the
program is going to continue. It is an outstanding program. It
gets young people involved at a level that we could never do in
any other way.
I thank you, Assistant Chief, and I yield back, Madam
Chair.
The Chair. Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman from
Mississippi, for 5 minutes.
Mr. Kelly. Thank you, Madam Chair.
I guess, what is the primary purpose of the National
Forests?
Ms. Lago. To have enduring natural resources for the
nation.
Mr. Kelly. And specifically for recreation or for people--I
know there is some money-making, but sometimes we forget the
main thing has got to be the main thing, and it is to provide
opportunities for people who may not have forests of their own
to go enjoy that, the recreation, and also, there is some
financial benefits to the United States as a whole. But it is
to provide those opportunities, recreational and hunting and
other things, for our people.
I just ask that you remember, the main thing has always got
to be the main thing. And so, I ask that we do all that we can
to keep that open and accessible to all those hunters and
recreationers and campers and bikers and cross-country runners
and trail hikers, that we do everything we can. Because that is
the purpose of these National Forests, what it was originally,
is to keep that open.
That being said, the House farm bill last time contained
several categorical exclusions that would have streamlined NEPA
for reconstructing or rehabilitating National Forest
infrastructure, from roads to dams and bridges, even bathroom
and shower facilities at recreational sites. How would these
CEs have been helpful to saving time and money, while
addressing the backlog of deferred maintenance programs?
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir. Thank you, Congressman.
The CEs that did not get included in the farm bill are very
similar to the CEs we have just proposed in our rulemaking for
NEPA for infrastructure for roads, bridges, and facilities. And
we have existing CEs for routine maintenance. But, most of our
facilities need something beyond routine maintenance, major
reconstruction, decommissioning, and so, these CEs in the
footprint of an existing structure allow us to be consistent
with state law, Federal law, documenting a decision, do that
work without going through a longer environmental analysis.
Mr. Kelly. And I just want you to understand, this has
major impacts. I received several calls last year when we
closed some National Forest roads, trails--that cars could go
on--to my squirrel hunters and folks who use those National
Forests to do that. There are significant impacts that maybe
you guys don't always see, but I can assure you, when you start
getting calls at the Congressional office because my squirrel
hunters can't get to where they want to go.
What have we done to do public-private partnerships? Are
you forbidden to do that? You know, because a lot of these
folks would go on and improve those trails, which would also
make them accessible to fight fires. Or are we co-oping with 70
percent of the engineers in the entire United States Army or in
the Guard and Reserves? Camp Shelby is a National Forest which
you have engineers, and they just did a new running trail down
there in the old rail bed system. What opportunities do we use
to use those to help us with the maintenance under the
supervision of the Forest Service?
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir. Thank you.
In a minute and 47 seconds, I won't be able to tell you all
the partnerships that we have, but for example, we have
partnerships with user groups--and I mentioned before Student
Conservation Association, Ducks Unlimited. We also have
partnerships with counties in particular that help us maintain
roads. The Army National Guard has an authority--because they
are largely engineers--they can do major construction,
reconstruction, demolition work on our sites and our
facilities.
The pathway to those things is the instrument that
documents the agreement and what each side needs to do. We can
be bureaucratic about that. We need to instill all of our
workforce with the curiosity and the innovation to use those
partnerships.
Mr. Kelly. What can we in Congress and on this Committee do
to make that process easier?
Ms. Lago. Sir, the attention in this hearing is a
tremendous, tremendous value. I will confer with my staff about
what is limiting in those partnerships and be happy to visit
with your staff.
Mr. Kelly. Please let me know. As an Army engineer who
still serves, I am interested in whatever we can do to make
this easier for you all so that we can serve the main thing,
the public that we are trying to give opportunities, offer
recreation to.
And with that, I yield back, Madam Chair.
The Chair. Thank you. I now recognize the gentlewoman from
Maine, for 5 minutes.
Ms. Pingree. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and thank
you to the Chair and Ranking Member for holding this hearing,
and to Associate Chief Lago, thank you very much for being here
today and for your long career and service in the Forest
Service. That is so important to all of us.
I am also on the House Appropriations Committee, the
Interior Subcommittee, so we had a very interesting and
instructive hearing earlier this year with Chief Christiansen.
We appreciated that very much, and also have spent a lot of
time trying to understand the funding of the Forest Service and
the unique challenges you have been dealing with because of the
wildfires and the challenges out West.
I am going to take a little bit different tact because I am
a Representative from Maine, and in Maine, we know the
importance of our forests. Eighty-six percent of Maine is
forested land. Only six percent of that is public, so very
different from the issues we deal with in the West. I think
that is the highest percentage of any state in the nation. We
have almost 17 million acres of forests, 16 million of which
are privately-owned, and that supports about 30,000 good paying
jobs.
One imminent concern that we feel our forests can help us
with is the issue of climate change, but it also presents a
challenge. Forests are facing rising temperatures, increased
and prolonged drought, extreme weather events, invasive
species, all contributing in many ways to widespread declines
in the forest health.
But on the other hand, forests can be a positive force for
change in the climate debate because of their role as carbon
sinks. Just last week, there was an article in the Portland
Press Herald in Maine that highlights the carbon store capacity
of our Maine forests, and without objection, Madam Chair, I
would like to submit that for the record.
The Chair. Without objection.
[The article referred to is located on p. 68.]
Ms. Pingree. Thank you.
By promoting the value of working forests in the United
States and recognizing the continual cycle of growth,
harvesting, and replanting, our working forests provide a
carbon solution.
Can you tell me a little bit about some of the efforts by
the Forest Service that promote healthy working forests, and
the carbon benefits associated with growing trees and the wood
products they produce?
Ms. Lago. Yes, Congresswoman, thank you.
We have a branch of the Forest Service called State and
Private Forestry. We have authorities under State and Private
Forestry that enable us--and first of all, recognizes there is
800 million acres of forest and land in this country owned by
states and private entities, and it is just as important for
conservation on those lands as on Federal lands. Our State and
Private Forestry authorities allow us to work with State
Foresters, private land owners, industrial corporations on
conservation efforts.
Just this morning, talking about innovation and
partnerships, one of my colleagues sent me an announcement from
the National Forest Foundation, U.S. Endowment for Forests and
Communities, and the Forest Service Partnership Office,
announcing grants for public-private partnerships for forest
stewardship and forest conservation. There is a lot of growing
interest in the importance and the benefits to all of us from a
health standpoint, from a climate change standpoint of keeping
forests healthy.
Finally, in the Southeast and in the Northeast, we have
programs called Keeping Forests Forests. They are big
partnerships between us, state forests, and industrial land
owners.
Ms. Pingree. Just to tack on one of the earlier questions,
I know the Forest Service is trying to streamline the NEPA
review to make it easier for people to manage forests without
significant environmental review. But what will you do if those
management practices aren't actually storing carbon? Are they
considering carbon sequestration in their efforts to streamline
NEPA reviews, or is that not part of the consideration?
Ms. Lago. No, ma'am, I don't see carbon sequestration as a
calculus in those environmental reviews.
Ms. Pingree. Okay. Well, I will follow up on that later.
One other quick thing. I am very familiar with the USDA's
regional climate hubs and have asked other USDA agencies about
their hubs in previous hearings. Based on budget documents that
I have received from USDA, I understand the Forest Service
spent $3.3 million on the climate hubs in 2016, which I think
is great, but the 2019 estimate is $400,000. Given the
challenges that we are dealing with, why is there such a big
drop, and do you see those as a valuable part of what you are
doing?
Ms. Lago. Yes. Our investment and our continued commitment
to climate hubs is significant. I don't have the dollar values
at hand. I can research that with staff and get back to you or
submit it for the record.
Ms. Pingree. Great. Well, I do have great concerns about
that number going down, and I appreciate your talking about the
value of them.
And I am basically out of time, so again, thank you very
much for your answers to the questions.
Ms. Lago. Thank you.
The Chair. I want to recognize the Chair of the full
Committee has joined us. Thank you for being here, Chairman
Peterson, and I now recognize the gentleman from Georgia, for 5
minutes.
Mr. Allen. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thank you for being
with us today.
In your written testimony, you mentioned that perhaps most
critically, forest infrastructure provides fire protection for
communities, especially by providing access to forest lands and
roads for firefighters and emergency responders during rescue
operations.
Due to the deferred maintenance backlog, how many miles of
Forest Service system roads have been decommissioned over the
past 10 years?
Ms. Lago. I don't have 10 year figures. On an average
basis, I think we decommission somewhere between 300 and 400
miles of road a year. It is not strictly related to deferred
maintenance. There might be restoration management objective
tied, but in any event, I will get you 10 year figures.
Mr. Allen. Okay. All right, and during wildfire
suppression, what percentage of decommissioned roads from
within the fire perimeter are reopened and used for suppression
activities? Do you have any idea?
Ms. Lago. I don't know on a percentage basis.
Mr. Allen. Okay.
Ms. Lago. I know we do do that. The fire line officer has
the call on it.
Mr. Allen. Right, okay.
And then to that, can you further elaborate on the
potential threat the deferred maintenance poses on being able
to respond to wildfires, and as a result, additional damage to
forest infrastructure?
Ms. Lago. I can't quantitatively summarize it, but the
deferred maintenance accumulates not just on roads, but also
our fire guard stations, our air tanker bases, our bunkhouses
where our firefighters are housed over the summer. So, the
accumulated effect of that is our capacity is diminished where
it wouldn't otherwise be.
Mr. Allen. And why is your capacity diminished? I mean, why
would you do that?
Ms. Lago. Well, we are not able to house people in
bunkhouses because of the deteriorating condition.
Mr. Allen. I got you.
Well, then that gets to my next question. The U.S. Forest
Service recently completed its comprehensive Capital
Improvement Plan. Can you further detail how you plan to
implement this strategy, going forward, as far as dealing with
these issues?
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir. Thank you.
Our plan has been released in the last couple of weeks.
What it primarily does is identifies criteria for submitting
projects for the national prioritization, and those criteria
include access to active forest management, access to
recreation facilities, access for fire operations, research and
development, and revenue generating destinations. Those
criteria are applied to the submitted project. It runs through
a model. The model prioritizes projects, and so we have funding
set aside and cut off the funding at the level that----
Mr. Allen. Outside of that, what is your biggest challenge?
Ms. Lago. The level of funding.
Mr. Allen. The level of funding?
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir.
Mr. Allen. You are looking at Members of this Committee who
are Members of the United States Congress, and you need more
funding?
Ms. Lago. That is correct.
Mr. Allen. Okay. All right. Thank you, and I yield back.
The Chair. Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman from
Arizona.
Mr. O'Halleran. Thank you, Madam Chair.
My district contains all or parts of six National Forests,
and the Grand Canyon, and 22 other National Parks and
monuments. I fully understand the conditions that you are
under, because I live in Forest Service country. I also--my
house is located--I take Forest Service roads back to the
house. That road hasn't been touched by a blade in about 20
years, and we even offered at one time to pay for part of it--
well, half of it, and they still didn't--because they only have
one grader for the entire Coconino National Forest. And that
grader has to be borrowed by the Kaibab sometimes in order to
get some roads done over there. And so, this whole concept of--
how many personnel has the Forest Service lost or percentage in
the last decade because of funding?
Ms. Lago. I have heard the figure \1/3\, 33 percent in non-
fire professions. I would have to double check is that the last
10 years or some other time period, but that is the figure that
I am familiar with.
Mr. O'Halleran. And how much more personnel are you going
to be able to hire now that you have been able to get the fire
funding off your books?
Ms. Lago. That is a good question. It is not easy to
answer.
In my own career, we have changed significantly from using
Forest Service employees and equipment doing projects, road
projects, for example, to funding partners or counties or
contract workers. So, the increase in funding may not
necessarily turn around more, let's say, road crews. What we do
need is senior experienced engineers and specialists who can
plan and design the work, and then do contract oversight.
Mr. O'Halleran. Well, let's put it another way. The fire
funding has been taken out. How much has been restored to your
budget in order to meet your other obligations and needs?
Ms. Lago. Okay, I can do that one.
It goes into effect in 2020, and if we had to request the
10 year average for fire suppression, it would--which we don't,
because the fire funding fix froze it at 2015 level, we would
have to increase the request for fire suppression by $270
million.
What that means is we get to add $270 million back to
programs, as long as our cap stays the same.
Mr. O'Halleran. Now, it is also, at least out in the West
and in my district, a lot of the forests were put in place
because of watershed protection. What impact has the lack of
funding had on the ability of us to protect our watersheds, our
wildlife that the hunters love, and our fish that they--and the
streams that impact the quality of our tourists and our
recreational activities in the forest?
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir. The two most important things that
affect water quality and water coming off National Forests is
healthy forest condition and maintaining the road system.
A former long-time Member of the House, Norm Dicks, used to
say, ``You don't fix the roads, you're going to drink the
roads.'' Our inability to maintain the road system contributes
to degraded water. Overcrowded, over-dense forests that
stagnate, lead to insect infestation, wildfire, that
contributes to poor water quality. We need to take care of
those two things.
Mr. O'Halleran. Well, I want to thank the Forest Service
for helping start the 4FRI projects in Arizona. It has been
very important. We are on another step now, and hopefully we
will move forward again.
But the management process that you just talked about is
critical to watershed protection and wildlife and the whole
ecosystem that is there. And I just look at Arizona as an
example. We have millions and millions of acres that are not
managed or haven't been able to be managed, I should say, that
are just going up in fire all the time, and that is throughout
the West. I would kind of like to know the plan of attack,
other than a 4FRI for the other National Forests.
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir.
You might recall, we announced an initiative earlier this
year that we called Shared Stewardship, and we have ten states
now under an agreement where we are partnering with states to
agree on the areas of highest priority treatment, and then we
are working on those areas together. And I think that is a
commitment that is going to build both support for the work
that we need to do, and additional capacity for doing it.
Mr. O'Halleran. Thank you, and I yield back.
The Chair. Thank you. Before moving to recognize Members of
the full Committee, I am going to recognize, for 5 minutes, the
gentlewoman from Iowa, who stepped out. Excuse me. I apologize.
I will now recognize, for 5 minutes, the gentleman from South
Dakota, Mr. Johnson.
Mr. Johnson. Thank you very much, Madam Chair.
I know in your line of work you get a fair amount of
criticism, but I just want to start by saying thank you on a
personal basis, ma'am. The Black Hills National Forest is a
ways, we have a very large Congressional district. I suppose I
am probably 4 hours from the National Forest, but I can't tell
you how many hundreds of memories my family has made in that
great national asset that you, throughout your career, and your
people have helped to maintain.
And it is wonderful. I mean, some of the most beautiful,
quiet moments in our lives have been nestled among those Black
Hills ponderosa pine. Some of our most active moments of our
life have been in that forest. And so, thank you for what you
are doing.
Of course, it is not just the Johnson family that enjoys
that resource. Every year, there are millions of South Dakotans
and folks from all over the world who recreate there. I get the
sense that our deferred maintenance backlog is perhaps smaller
there than in many of the forests we have discussed. Perhaps,
because it is such an actively managed, well-maintained forest.
We have some of the highest timber sales of National Forests in
the country. And so, if you are willing to, ma'am, could you
elaborate on the connection, if any, that exists between a
well-maintained, actively managed forest and the impact that
that can have on lower deferred maintenance?
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir. Thank you for the opportunity, and
thank you very much for the compliment. The Black Hills is a
very special place, I agree.
All our forests are similar in the way that people love
them and rely on them. And that said, they are still unique in
their own way. And where a forest is well-maintained, able to
reduce deferred maintenance, my guess is that is a forest with
a lot of thriving partnerships. We don't have the same ability
to partner everywhere. It depends on opportunity and economic
capacity. But it also depends on commitment to partnering.
And so, I would put my finger on partnerships where the
Black Hills are concerned.
Mr. Johnson. Well, I think that is exquisitely well said,
and I do think thriving partnerships are a key part of that
story of a lower deferred maintenance backlog, and higher use
of the forest. Thank you for calling out the importance of
having a USDA commitment to that, and to the extent that that
commitment can even grow in the Black Hills National Forest and
elsewhere, I would certainly love to see more efforts in that
regard.
I hate to bring up such a terrible subject of the mountain
pine beetle, because I know that little fellow has done a lot
of damage in a lot of places. In the Black Hills, we had less
damage from the pine beetle than was feared at the onset of
this round of the epidemic, and frankly, less damage than many
National Forests.
I have attributed that to a more actively managed forest. I
want to give you an opportunity to correct my misconception, if
I have one, and offer any other thoughts you have.
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir.
Definitely, well-maintained forests are in a more vigorous
condition, and a more vigorous condition allows forests to
repel bark beetle attacks. It is a native pest. They have been
around a long time. What has changed is the vitality of forests
and their ability to just naturally withstand them.
I think definitely better maintained forests, active
management such as what we have in the Black Hills, is key to
preventing further spread by that insect.
Mr. Johnson. Well, Madam Chair, I would just close by
trying to highlight some of these great phrases. This
conversation has pulled out the importance of active
management, being well-maintained, and having thriving
partnerships. Those are wonderful phrases, Associate Chief.
Thanks for the work you do, and thanks for your presence here
today.
Ms. Lago. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Johnson. And I yield back.
The Chair. I now recognize Mr. Thompson from Pennsylvania,
for 5 minutes.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Madam Chair. Thanks for hosting
this, and Ranking Member, for this hearing.
Assistant Chief, good to see you. Thank you for your
service and your record of service to the nation through the
Forest Service, I greatly appreciate it. Also, special thanks
when you were testifying on the other side of the Capitol in
the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. You used
Longhouse Drive in the Allegheny National Forest as an example
of the threat of lack of maintenance and roadways
deteriorating. And as you really nicely point out in your
testimony, the users of that road contribute about $1.5 million
a year to the local businesses, local economy. That just speaks
to the importance--the economic importance of this.
You have talked a lot about partnership. I am going to
start out by really--I think one of our best partners--and we
have many great partners, obviously, with the Forest Service--
but one of the best partners are those from the forest products
industry, the timber industry, that bid on contracts, help us
so that we can maintain a healthy forest. We make it so that
they are the largest carbon sinks in the world. Also, as my
friend across the aisle talked about making sure that those
healthy forests are--making sure that we have a great
filtration system for those watersheds that start in our
National Forests.
And so, I am concerned right now. The first thing I have
for you is not really looking for a response on, just a request
to take back. And I am going to follow up in writing; but, the
situation with the tariffs, and specifically the hardwoods
industry, we have a lot of folks, good people that bid and
obtain contracts. Specifically, I am going to speak about
hardwoods, because I have the Allegheny National Forest.
Unfortunately, with the trade wars that are going on, the
bottom just completely dropped out of the price. They bid at a
certain price. They are mandated contracted to pursue that, but
they have lost their market for the time being.
I will say talking with them, they are all behind the
President and they are supportive, and you know, they want to
see fair and free trade, which is what the President wants.
But in the meantime, just two things that we could look at
that and will be sent along in a written request. You know, any
type of trade relief for hardwoods. They were not included in
that package. And I get it. It is different for--it might be
because a part of this is administered--that part of trade is
administered through commerce. I don't know why. Trees are a
crop. It is agriculture. But they need--we are hoping,
actually, just to get resolution to trade agreements. But if
this goes on for any amount of time, those hardwood folks need
this. Because if we lose those industries, then we will not
have that valuable partner to keep our forests healthy. And in
the long run, that would be a deterioration of tremendous
proportions of our National Forests.
The other thing is a request to take back is we need
extension on current contracts, and I would say up to a period
of 2 years at this point, because there is not a business plan
given what the contracts are at and where the pricing has
fallen. That may be a little more difficult, I understand, but
those are just--not really looking for a response on that. If
you could take that back and I will be following back up with
certainly the Secretary and the President on those.
The most pressing maintenance issue that we currently have
in the Allegheny National Forest is the Mayburg Bridge located
in Forest County. There are 128 permanent and seasonal
dwellings in Mayburg and the bridge, which is owned by the
Forest Service, and it is the only really practical year-round
route in and out of that village. Thankfully, we don't have any
kids right now living in that area, so there are no school
buses, because that bridge would not handle a school bus. And I
would be concerned if there is a fire, because an emergency
vehicle is not going to be handled as well.
Unfortunately, that bridge has fallen into disrepair and is
in need of critical repairs. The Forest Service has indicated
that the funding will be coming for the bridge, but there is
still a lot of uncertainty about the future.
Now, currently maintenance for infrastructure like this
must be a priority, yet it is not being completed. So, it is a
simple question. How is the Forest Service prioritizing this
kind of maintenance, especially when it comes down to access
for local residents and public safety?
Ms. Lago. Thank you, Congressman.
I thought we had the funding for that bridge and completed
the environmental analysis, and I thought it was moving
forward. I will double check on that.
Funding for maintenance is part of regional allocations,
and the priorities for maintenance is decided at the local
level. When it exceeds routine maintenance and becomes a
capital investment, then it is going to be subject to that
capital investment strategy and those criteria for
prioritization that I mentioned.
Mr. Thompson. I appreciate it. I also appreciate your
engagement with the community, because it was apparent in the
beginning--I am not sure the Forest Service or whoever was
involved even locally recognized that there was a permanent
village, basically. People live there year-round, and quite
frankly, it was the only way in and out. But, because of how
you all did conduct yourselves, engaging in the community, that
all came to light, and I really appreciate it. And I appreciate
the support with the Mayburg bridge.
Ms. Lago. Thank you.
The Chair. I now recognize the gentlewoman from Washington,
for 5 minutes.
Ms. Schrier. Thank you, Madam Chair, and Ms. Lago, thank
you for coming today and joining us. It is great to have a
witness with experience in Washington forests, and I would love
to host you back at home, along with the Forest Service Chief,
in the district--which by the way, includes Mount Rainier, the
Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest----
Ms. Lago. Beautiful area.
Ms. Schrier. To raise some of these various issues on
deferred maintenance, and in addition to the deferred
maintenance projects the Forest Service Legacy Roads and Trails
Remediation Program is a critical program that leverages
dollars outside of the Forest Service to address water quality
issues, and I have an appropriations letter for the record that
I would like to submit, outlining the importance of that
program, and the need for it to have a dedicated line item.
The Chair. So noted.
[The letter referred to is located on p. 72.]
Ms. Schrier. The program was created in 2008, because the
general Forest Service road maintenance budget was unable to
address the sheer volume of blocked culverts, landslides, and
washouts, which were impacting water quality and access for
threatened and endangered species. And in Washington State and
other parts of the country, the program is critical to address
water quality issues and habitat, particularly for Chinook
salmon, bull trout, and steelhead. These fish are an important
part of the Northwest culture, heritage, ecosystem, and they
have suffered heavily, as you know. A recent New York Times
report stated that the Chinook salmon may be extinct in 20
years. I will also add that Chinook salmon are the key food
source for the endangered southern resident Orcas, and old
weather-damaged roads and broken culverts are key culprits in
this demise.
Washington State has invested millions, multiple millions
of dollars to address downstream barriers and culverts,
including dams and whatnot, while the Chinook salmon spawning
grounds are located upstream in the National Forest headwaters.
And on page 4 of your testimony, you outline the criteria
for road projects, listing priorities. And unfortunately, the
projects that improve wildlife and aquatic passage are last.
And so, I was just wondering if you could expand on this and
help me understand how projects affecting water quality can be
addressed in a timely manner when the Forest Service is facing
a $5+ billion backlog?
Ms. Lago. Yes, thank you, Congresswoman.
When I was still in the Pacific Northwest, we hosted a
chiefs review, and the theme of the entire review was Save our
Salmon. I really understand the integral role of salmon in the
economy and lifestyle, and that ecosystem.
In addition to the criteria, which includes benefits--the
ability to be an economic driver in water and recreation, there
is an intangible benefit criteria. You know, salmon is a lot
more--and water quality is a lot more than an intangible
benefit certainly, and local managers--also there is a layer
where they put a personal priority on their projects, based on
their knowledge of local issues and what is important to the
local economy, people, community.
So, there is more than just the criteria that I named in my
testimony. It is fair to really think about how we are valuing
water, the economic value of water, as well as the fact that we
all rely on it. I will go back and discuss that.
Ms. Schrier. Thank you, and the way I interpreted economic
was really related to timber; but, if you think about the
recreational economy and salmon and habitat and our Tribes,
that those do weave in economics.
Yes. I appreciate your going back. I think that is it, and
I would just like to reiterate my invitation, and thank you for
paying attention to this issue.
I yield back the rest of my time.
The Chair. Thank you. I now recognize the gentleman from
California, for 5 minutes, Mr. Panetta.
Mr. Panetta. Thank you, Madam Chair. I appreciate you
allowing me to sit in on this very important hearing,
especially when it comes to my district on the Central Coast.
Ranking Member LaMalfa, good morning, and good morning,
Chief. Thank you for being here. I appreciate your testimony
and appreciate your service.
I represent the Central Coast of California, Big Sur Los
Padres National Forest, and in 2016, I am sure you know well,
we had a pretty extensive fire there called the Soberanes fire,
which encompassed about 206\2\ miles being burned, and the cost
at the time was the most expensive in our nation's history at
the time, until recently, a cost of about $260 million.
The reason that fire started was because of an illegal
campfire, unfortunately, and we are seeing a lot of that,
especially in Los Padres Forest, in the sense that you have a
number of people out there, despite the numerous signs
everywhere, saying don't do something as stupid as that. But
people continue to conduct themselves in that manner,
unfortunately. Obviously, it would be nice to have staff there,
Forest Service officers there, who actually are on the grounds
and enforcing those types of laws. But unfortunately, we had to
resort to certain volunteers. I say unfortunately because that
shouldn't be their job. They are not armed. They don't have the
right law and the legal background to enforce those types of
laws. But that is what we have had to resort to in order to
ensure that people are out there, making sure that people don't
do these acts that could threaten--the forest could threaten
people.
Obviously staffing is a big issue, and you know that. And
so, I was wondering if you could elaborate on any sort of plans
that you have to address the chronic staffing issues, obviously
not just in Los Padres National Forest, but in other National
Forests across our country?
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir. Thank you.
As I mentioned, and I am not sure if you were in the room
at the time.
Mr. Panetta. And I apologize if I was not. I just came in
late. Thank you.
Ms. Lago. No problem. The result of the fire funding fix is
we have room, if our cap stays the same, to request funding for
other programs that would have had to go to the 10 year average
for fire suppression. And so, we are deeply aware of the
shortages in many programs. Law enforcement and fire prevention
are two of the areas forest protection officers--which is a
designation for people in all kinds of resources--but in
addition to their resource job, they patrol. So, having more
people on the ground is something that we are acutely aware of.
We did get direct hire authority recently for firefighting
jobs, which allows us to more efficiently hire people to be on
the ground. It will last for 1 year while OPM sees how we use
it. There is not unlimited money. We all know that. Being more
efficient with the money that we have and prioritizing these
on-the-ground activities is how we can address those issues.
Mr. Panetta. Got you. Thank you. Thank you. I appreciate
that.
Now, obviously, and I know you have talked about deferred
maintenance, and in Los Padres, our deferred maintenance
exceeds $24 million.
First of all, my question is where does that lie relative
to other National Forests and deferred maintenance?
Ms. Lago. I believe I submitted for the record a deferred
maintenance breakdown by state. I don't have one by forest, but
I am sure it exists and I would be happy to supply it.
Mr. Panetta. Understood.
Obviously, as we approach the start of the new fiscal year,
as the wildfire fix funding becomes available, can you give me
a little bit of light on the priorities, little bit of light on
your priorities, specifically whether you will be prioritizing
deferred maintenance backlog? I would like to hear about Los
Padres, but I would be more than willing to hear about
California.
Ms. Lago. Okay, thank you.
A lot of people will eventually weigh in on what the
priorities are.
Mr. Panetta. Sure.
Ms. Lago. We have had a continuing emphasis on active
management and reducing fuels. I don't see that changing. This
hearing helps us highlight the issue of maintenance and
deferred maintenance for our facilities. It is felt throughout
the Forest Service and throughout the communities that we
serve. I am happy to work with you and your staff and this
Committee's staff on how to prioritize, going forward.
Mr. Panetta. Outstanding. I look forward to that.
I yield back my time. Thank you, Madam Chair.
The Chair. Thank you. With the first round of questions
completed and without objection, we will begin a second round
of questions. Members will be recognized for 3 minutes in order
of seniority.
All right. I will begin by recognizing myself for 3
minutes.
Associate Chief Lago, thank you for all of your answers
today, and I would also offer for the hearing record a copy of
the Department of Commerce's news release on outdoor recreation
economy.
[The news release referred to is located on p. 29.]
The Chair. The report released just last week shows that
the outdoor recreation economy accounted for 2.2 percent of GDP
and supported 5.2 million jobs in 2017. This not only includes
conventional activities like camping, hiking, boating, but also
value-added activities such as construction and travel. For the
first time, the report included information on the recreation
industry's contributions by state.
Is data from reports like this considered as the Forest
Service prioritizes maintenance, and does the Forest Service
use data like this to leverage assistance from states and other
partners?
Ms. Lago. Yes, thank you, Madam Chair.
First of all with regard to that report, it is interesting
that the statistic of 2.2 percent might sound small, but it is
interesting to note that it is growing almost 50 percent faster
than general GDP. And I can tell you from the communities that
I have lived in, the ones that I hear from that depend on a
recreation economy, it is far more impactful to their economies
than 2.2 percent.
We recognize that 15 states across the country now have
recreation officers, so showing that states recognize the
importance of this recreation economy. It is not right for
every state, but definitely the recognition of the Commerce
Department, our own within USDA, not just our agency, but Rural
Development has an expanding recreation economy interest. So,
it helps us bring partners to the table. It helps us bring
investors to the table.
So, to answer your question in a word, yes.
The Chair. Thank you so much, and coming from the
Commonwealth of Virginia where we have seen recreation continue
to be a strong use of our natural resources and a major
economic driver here, I thank you for your comments.
I now recognize Mr. LaMalfa, for 3 minutes.
Mr. LaMalfa. Thank you again. I appreciate, again,
Assistant Chief Lago, for your being here.
I wanted to delve a little bit more into, again with the
road maintenance and the issues there where access has been
more difficult over the years. We have wrestled in northern
California with what is being put in travel management plans,
and it seems like it just means less and less access. We are
finding more and more closed gates and less ability for people
during the snow season for snowmobiling or off-road activity,
hunting, anybody to take vehicles in, or without vehicles. We
are finding more and more closed gates.
Does this tie in partly towards a changing view of the
multi-purpose, multi-use forest policy, or is it more about the
backlog we have of maintenance? You are talking about bridges
being removed and no longer counting them as an asset, but you
know, a great amount of frustration by my constituents, and
neighboring districts as well, is that whether you call it the
travel management plan or the maintenance backlog, it is just
meaning less access.
The travel management plan efforts, are they moving in that
direction because of the lack of maintenance, or is it some
other philosophical shift?
Ms. Lago. Thank you, Ranking Member.
We are not walking away from the multiple-use sustained
yield mandate from Congress. It is more the observation that we
want people to have access to their public lands. They don't
need public lands if they don't have access to them. But we
need to maintain the resource in a healthy condition, but we
also need to maintain those roads in a safe condition for
people to use them, roads and trails.
Our effort at travel management is aimed at looking at the
resource from the standpoint of what can we safely provide?
Mr. LaMalfa. Okay. Well, even as Mr. Panetta mentioned
here, he had a six-digit fire in number of acres in his
district. We have multiple six-digit fires in the more northern
part and other western states, and an important component of
being able to do the pre-fire work is this access, and as well
when it does come to fire suppression time, having these roads
available and intact bridges and all that, and not closed gates
and all that.
Can you please comment on the fire aspect of that and how
important it is we step back up on this?
Ms. Lago. Well, yes, sir. Roads are an essential way that
we stop fires before they get large, get people out of harm's
way when there are fires, and we absolutely need a safe,
accessible road system to be able to fulfill that part of our
mission.
Mr. LaMalfa. The multi-use? Okay, thank you. I yield back.
The Chair. I now recognize Mr. Thompson, for 3 minutes.
Mr. Thompson. Madam Chair, thank you.
Chief, I just want to check in. I know in the Forest
Service we use a concessionaire style approach, and
concessionaires play a very important role, obviously. They
help us where we need, it helps supplement the staffing and in
keeping areas open and access. My understanding, it's the
Granger-Thye Act which basically defines a landlord-tenant
relationship where the Forest Service is the landlord
responsible for all behind-the-wall fixes, including the
maintenance, capital improvements. And the tenant, the
concessionaire, just keeps everything clean and operating.
My question for you is would you like to have the authority
actually that has been granted to the Department of Defense and
to the Army Corps of Engineers which allows, basically, where
30 year leases are an option--not mandated, but an option, and
in that 30 years, that longevity, what would be that the
concessionaires are able to take on the responsibility for some
of the capital improvements.
Today, that doesn't occur in the Forest Service with a
concessionaire system. I don't know the timeline on when the
Department of Defense and the Army Corps made that transition.
Just a simple question. Was that something Forest Service would
want to consider getting the authority to do? Obviously, we
would have to provide that through the bill or whatever.
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir. I am not sure what the Army Corps of
Engineers authority is, but in fact, the Forest Service did get
leasing authority in the 2018 Farm Bill. We are developing
rules and directives, but it would enable us to do those kind
of long-term leases. I am not sure of the time period, but also
to enable the leaseholder to do improvements.
I think the Park Service has some kind of authority like
that, too. I can check on that and get back to you.
Mr. Thompson. I appreciate that. It just seems like it is
working well with the Army Corps. I have seen some of the
projects, obviously, in my Congressional district from time to
time with what these folks do, and so, it would be great to be
able--I am glad to hear that we provided at least part of that
authority.
Ms. Lago. Yes, sir.
Mr. Thompson. If we haven't done enough, please let us
know. We want you to have the authority to be successful.
Ms. Lago. Thank you.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Madam Chair. I yield back.
The Chair. And I now recognize Ranking Member LaMalfa for
one more 3 minute question.
Mr. LaMalfa. Just one more. Thank you so much.
Again, when we were talking about the backlog, when we are
seeing the Forest Service absorbing more lands through
donations from maybe NGOs or other instances, or the LWCF has
also introduced more land back into Forest Service control. How
is that contributing to the backlog and your ability to keep
up, and as well as updating this $5.2 billion backlog figure?
Ms. Lago. Well, that is a great question.
I am not sure what the value or the assets that a lot of
the lands that we acquire through Land and Water Conservation
Fund. I am familiar with areas that we prioritize because they
have important wildlife habitat value, water quality value,
that kind of thing, which leads me to think they don't have a
lot of infrastructure on them. But you know, I don't know that
conclusively and I would have to do some checking.
Mr. LaMalfa. I would be really interested in that, how much
that is adding to the burden of an already difficult situation.
So, with that, I appreciate it, Madam Chair, and for your
appearance today, Ms. Lago, and I will yield back.
The Chair. Thank you. I would like to thank Associate Chief
Lago for her comments and for her time here today.
What we have heard today underscores the importance of the
Forest Service's work, and the challenges it faces. I hope we
all leave here with an appreciation for the role that well-
maintained forest infrastructure can have significant impacts
on people's lives, their work, and their play in and around
National Forests, as well as the communities and economies
surrounding our National Forests.
We have also heard loud and clear that dozens of
infrastructure projects are ready for implementation, but
require the necessary funding, and carrying out these much-
needed maintenance projects will support jobs in rural
communities, as soon as the Forest Service receives the funding
to complete them.
I hope that we all leave here with a better sense of what
we can do in the Subcommittee to help the Forest Service carry
out its mission, and again, I thank you, Ms. Lago, for your
time today.
Before we adjourn, I invite the Ranking Member to make any
closing remarks that he may have.
Without any, under the Rules of the Committee, the record
of today's hearing will remain open for 10 calendar days to
receive additional material and supplemental written responses
from the witness to any question posed by a Member.
This hearing of the Subcommittee on Conservation and
Forestry is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:23 a.m., the Subcommittee was adjourned.]

Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account, U.S. and Prototype for States,
2017
New prototype statistics show state value added, compensation, and
employment
The U.S. outdoor recreation economy accounted for 2.2 percent
($427.2 billion) of current-dollar gross domestic product (GDP) in 2017
(national table 2) according to statistics released today by the Bureau
of Economic Analysis. The Outdoor Recreation Satellite Account (ORSA)
also shows that inflation-adjusted (real) GDP for the outdoor
recreation economy grew by 3.9 percent in 2017, faster than the 2.4
percent growth of the overall U.S. economy. Real gross output,
compensation, and employment all grew faster in outdoor recreation than
for the economy as a whole.
With this release, BEA introduces prototype statistics on outdoor
recreation for all 50 states and the District of Columbia. These new
statistics show that the relative size of the outdoor recreation
economy ranged from 5.4 percent of GDP for Hawaii to 1.2 percent of GDP
for the District of Columbia.
Outdoor Recreation Value-Added: Percent of State GDP, 2017
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.
Outdoor Recreation by Activity
For the first time, ORSA includes information on the contribution
of outdoor recreation activities to GDP. These data, referred to as
value added by activity statistics, are available at both the national
and state level.
Activities are grouped into three categories: conventional core
activities (such as camping, hiking, boating, and hunting); other core
activities (such as gardening and outdoor concerts); and supporting
activities (such as construction, travel and tourism, local trips, and
government expenditures).
Conventional outdoor recreation accounted for 30.6 percent of the
outdoor recreation economy nationwide in 2017, other recreation
accounted for 19.3 percent, and the remaining 50.1 percent was
supporting activities (national table 2).
Nominal Value-Added for Largest Conventional Outdoor Recreation
Activities, 2017 ($ Billions)
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Other value added by activity highlights include the following:
Boating/fishing was the largest conventional activity for
the nation as a whole at $20.9 billion in current-dollar value
added. At the state level, this was the largest conventional
activity in 29 states and the District of Columbia, led by
Florida ($2.7 billion) and California ($1.8 billion).
RVing was the second-largest conventional activity
nationally with $16.9 billion in current-dollar value added. It
was also the largest conventional activity in nine states, led
by Indiana ($2.9 billion) and Ohio ($599.5 million).
Snow activities was the sixth-largest conventional activity
at the national level with $5.6 billion in current-dollar value
added. At the state level, snow activities was the largest
conventional activity in Colorado ($1.5 billion), Utah ($549.2
million), and Vermont ($175.9 million).
Guided tours/outfitted travel, part of the other core
activities category, accounted for $12.9 billion and was also
one of the fastest growing activities in 2017, growing 11.4
percent.
Outdoor Recreation by Industry
Today's data also show the role that different industries play in
the outdoor recreation economy, including their impact on value added,
gross output, employment, and compensation. The arts, entertainment,
recreation, accommodation, and food services sector was the largest
contributor to the U.S. outdoor recreation economy in 2017, accounting
for $112.9 billion (national table 10). At the state level, this same
sector was the largest contributor to outdoor recreation for 26 states
and the District of Columbia.
Industry Composition of Outdoor Recreation Nominal Value-Added, 2017 ($
Billions)
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Other value added by industry highlights include the following:
Retail trade had the second largest sector contribution to
outdoor recreation nationally, accounting for $95.7 billion of
current-dollar value added. Retail trade was the largest
contributor to outdoor recreation value added in 17 states,
including Texas ($8.5 billion), Washington ($2.8 billion), and
Ohio ($2.7 billion).
Manufacturing contributed $51.7 billion nationally to the
outdoor recreation economy in 2017 and was the third largest
outdoor recreation sector. At the state level, manufacturing
was the largest sector for outdoor recreation value added in
Indiana ($4.7 billion), Wisconsin ($2.0 billion), Louisiana
($1.6 billion), and Kansas ($684.2 million).
Seeking Public Comment
The public is invited to submit comments on the prototype state
statistics by emailing [email protected] Comments are due by
March 31, 2020. The feedback will be used to help finalize data sources
and methodology for the state outdoor recreation statistics. Official
state statistics are scheduled for release in the fall of 2020.

the economic activity associated with outdoor recreation spending and
production in a state's economy. The state-level prototype statistics
are an extension of the national industry ORSA statistics. The
concepts, definitions, and methodology used to produce state-level
prototype statistics are consistent with the national industry
concepts, definitions, and methodology. The U.S. ORSA methodology paper
(https://www.bea.gov/resources/methodologies/outdoor-recreation-
satellite-account-methodology) provides more information about these
concepts, definitions, and methodology.
Geography of outdoor recreation
Outdoor recreation is measured by place of production, not residence
of consumer. The value of manufactured goods, such as boats, is
assigned to the state where they are produced, even if the goods are
not ultimately used there. Services, such as sailing lessons, are
assigned to the location where they are consumed. The value of services
provided by retailers, such as boat dealers, is also assigned to the
location of sale. The services of retailers (known as trade margins)
are not measured by sales but are most akin to sales less the cost of
goods sold. The production of imported goods is excluded from ORSA, but
the value of the services of retailers selling the imported goods is
included.
Outdoor recreation spending and production are allocated to states
by applying state-level data to detailed, underlying national values.
The underlying estimates are distributed to states before aggregation
to publication levels to provide the most accurate state values
possible. Prototype statistics are primarily based on time-series data
generated from the Economic Census and Quarterly Census of Employment
and Wages (QCEW). Additional government and nongovernment data sources
are used to supplement the census data and to refine and evaluate the
statistics.
Regional tables
Activity tables show states' total outdoor recreation value-added
contributions to an activity, regardless of the contributing industry.
For example, boating value added by state represents all contributions
by in-state boat manufacturers, marinas, repair shops, etc., to the
boating activity.
Industry tables show states' total outdoor recreation-related value
added, employment, and compensation by industry, regardless of the
outdoor activities the industries support. Outdoor recreation-related
activity is included in the states' industry totals even if the final
consumption occurs outside the state.
A state's total value added across all outdoor recreation activities
will equal the state's total value added across all outdoor recreation
industries.
Definitions
ORSA employment consists of all full-time, part-time, and temporary
wage-and-salary jobs where the workers are engaged in the production of
outdoor recreation goods and services. Self-employed individuals are
excluded from employment totals.
ORSA compensation consists of the pay to employees (including wages
and salaries, and benefits such as employer contributions to pension
and health funds) in return for their outdoor recreation-related work
during a given year. Pay to the self-employed is excluded from
compensation but included in value added.
ORSA value-added (also referred to as GDP) consists of the value of
outdoor recreation goods and services produced less the value of
expenses incurred for their production. The activity of self-employed
individuals is included in value added.

Definitions
Gross domestic product (GDP) or value-added is the value of the
goods and services produced by the nation's economy less the value of
the goods and services used up in production. GDP is also equal to the
sum of personal consumption expenditures, gross private domestic
investment, net exports of goods and services, and government
consumption expenditures and gross investment.
Gross output (GO) is the value of the goods and services produced
by the nation's economy. It is principally measured using industry
sales or receipts, including sales to final users (GDP) and sales to
other industries.
Current-dollar estimates are valued in the prices of the period
when the transactions occurred--that is, at ``market value.'' Also
referred to as ``nominal estimates'' or as ``current-price estimates.''
Chained-dollar estimates are calculated by taking the current-
dollar level of a series in the base period and multiplying it by the
change in the chained-type quantity index number for the series since
the base period. Chained-dollar estimates correctly show growth rates
for a series but are not additive in periods other than the base
period.
ORSA employment consists of all full-time, part-time, and temporary
wage-and-salary jobs where the workers are engaged in the production of
outdoor recreation goods and services. Self-employed individuals are
excluded from employment totals.
ORSA compensation consists of the pay to employees (including wages
and salaries, and benefits such as employer contributions to pension
and health funds) in return for their outdoor recreation-related work
during a given year. Pay to the self-employed is excluded from
compensation but included in value added.
ORSA value-added (also referred to as GDP) consists of the value of
outdoor recreation goods and services produced less the value of
expenses incurred for their production. The activity of self-employed
individuals is included in value added.
Statistical Conventions
Quarter-to-quarter percent changes are calculated from unrounded
data and are annualized. Annualized growth rates show the rate of
change that would have occurred had the pattern been repeated over four
quarters (1 year). Annualized rates of change can be calculated as
follows: (((level of later quarter/level of earlier quarter)-4)^1)*100.
Quarterly estimates are expressed at seasonally adjusted annual rates,
unless otherwise specified. Quarter-to-quarter dollar changes are
differences between published estimates.

Fires in the Amazon this summer have increased global
awareness of the role of rainforests in tempering climate
change. Less appreciated is the carbon storage capacity of
forests like Maine's.

Denny Gallaudet has been harvesting his woodlot in Cumberland
for 40 years, mostly for firewood to heat his home, but has
changed his management techniques to reduce carbon loss from
the carbon-rich soil and carbon-banking trees. Derek Davis/
Staff Photographer.
This story is part of Covering Climate Now, a global
collaboration of more than 220 news outlets to strengthen
coverage of the climate story.
Cumberland--The big, old pine isn't good for much, at least not
financially. A legacy tree from 75 years ago when the rolling woodlands
in this Portland suburb were hayfields, it's a landmark on Denny
Gallaudet's 25 acre woodlot, its spindly, branch-studded trunk reaching
like fingers toward the sky.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
A logging contractor might suggest felling it for softwood chips.
But to Gallaudet, the misshapen pine has a higher value. By his
calculations, it's storing roughly 6 metric tons of carbon as it grows,
keeping heat-trapping carbon dioxide out of Earth's warming atmosphere.
Fires in the Amazon this summer have increased awareness of the
role of rain forests in blunting climate change. Less appreciated is
the carbon storage capacity of northern temperate forests, like the one
covering most of Maine.
Now Gallaudet, who's leading a team at Sierra Club Maine, is trying
to figure out how the state's small woodlot owners can be encouraged to
manage their land not only for income, wildlife and recreation, but to
maximize carbon sequestration. Together, these local forests have the
potential to become a world-class carbon sink, Gallaudet and other
activists say.
America's northern forest covers roughly 176 million acres and its
growth has been increasing, according to the most recent USDA survey,
in part because of reduced timber harvesting for the region's
contracted paper industry. By some measures, today's forest is soaking
up 1 to 2 tons of carbon per acre every year.
As the state with the highest percentage of forest land in the
nation, Maine is a critical vault in this carbon bank, removing and
storing 1.4 pounds of carbon (https://www.mdf.org/wp-content/uploads/
2019/04/MOG-FullReport2019-FNL.pdf) for every pound emitted by burning
fossil fuels. Put another way, 5.5 acres of forest (https://
www.epa.gov/energy/greenhouse-gas-equivalencies-calculator) can capture
the annual emissions from one passenger car, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency.
But Gallaudet believes the small landowners who control 40 percent
of Maine's 17.6 million acres are in a unique position to do more.
Collectively, they could substantially offset the CO2
emitted each year in Maine from cars, factories and energy production.
Transformational Tactics
To get there, many small owners would need to change the way they
manage their land and embrace the practices of low-impact forestry.
They'll have to leave more big, carbon-banking trees standing, like
Gallaudet's old pine, as well as more dead trees. After a harvest,
they'll need to leave more limbs and branches on the forest floor. Both
will emit carbon, of course, but slowly, as they decay over time.
Landowners also will need to employ logging methods that have less
impact on the soil, where a surprising 50 percent carbon is stored. And
in some instances, for some trees, they just shouldn't do any cutting.
In the long run, this transformation will require changes in
government policies and perhaps modifications to the nascent markets
that offer financial rewards for storing carbon, so small owners can
see value from carbon storage, just as they do from pulp, chips or saw
logs.
Right now, those financial incentives are largely absent for small
woodlots, which in Maine tend to be less than 500 acres.
``We've struggled to find a way for small owners to participate in
the carbon market,'' said Tom Doak, executive director of Maine
Woodland Owners, whose members own a total of 500,000 acres. ``We've
looked at this for years and so far can't make the numbers work.''
But simply increasing awareness of how forests store carbon, Doak
said, can lead owners to make changes.
``There is an educational role,'' he said.
Earning Credit for Carbon
One example is an upcoming presentation (http://www.mofga.org/The-
Fair/Schedule) on carbon-capture forestry techniques, Sept. 21 at the
Common Ground Fair. It will be led by Peter Hagerty, who serves on a
low-impact forestry committee with the Maine Organic Farmers and
Gardeners Association and logs 100 acres of woodland with draft horses.
Hagerty said one challenge in making the transition will be for
landowners and policy makers to agree on the science behind carbon-
friendly harvesting techniques and not see it as a threat to jobs and
traditional logging.
``I'm hopeful that the forest industry in Maine can adapt,'' he
said.
Carbon Cycle

Managing woodlands for carbon capture isn't an entirely new idea.
Some leading environmental groups with a presence in Maine, as well as
the Passamaquoddy Tribe, have been pioneers in what's known as the
carbon offsets markets.
Based largely in California, these markets (https://
californiacarbon.info/) require a landowner to maintain a certified
level of carbon storage, typically for 100 years. In exchange, they get
a given price-per-ton, which recently stood around $15. That's
comparable to what they might get paid for stumpage, or timber sales.
The credits are sold under what's called a cap-and-trade arrangement
with utilities or petroleum companies, which buy them to offset their
emissions and meet state mandates.
In 2012, the Downeast Lakes Land Trust (https://downeastlakes.org/
the-finite-carbon-lyme-grand-lake-stream-improved-forest-management-
project/) completed the nation's first carbon credit sale. It finished
a second project in 2016, earning millions of dollars to buy additional
land for its conservation objectives around Grand Lake Stream. Similar
sales have been done by the Appalachian Mountain Club and The Nature
Conservancy. These projects total more than 200,000 acres.
Maine's large, commercial timberland owners so far haven't embraced
this model. In 2017, the Keeping Maine's Forest collaborative group
surveyed several land managers and found that while they had explored
the California market, they are holding off for now.
The group's report (https://crsf.umaine.edu/wp-content/uploads/
sites/214/2017/03/Carbon-Markets-in-Maine.pdf) found: ``While the up-
front payout from carbon credits can be substantial and a good way to
diversify income from forest land, the land managers found the costs,
risks, and the 100 year commitment required by carbon projects not
worthwhile at current credit prices.''
These cost and time commitments present major hurdles for small
owners. Gallaudet, a former bank President, estimated it would cost him
$15,000 to have his woodlot's carbon storage certified to meet
California standards, or even the less-valuable Regional Greenhouse Gas
Initiative standards in the Northeast.
``To my knowledge,'' Gallaudet said, ``there are no lead certifiers
in Maine either for California or RGGI. If small Maine landowners chose
to forgo timber sales in favor of banking carbon, they currently have
no way of monetizing the value they are creating in the form of
sequestered metric tons of CO2.''
Careful Stewardship
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Denny Gallaudet uses low-impact forestry techniques to
preserve as much of his woodlot's carbon storage as he can. He
estimates his 25 acre lot has 39 tons of carbon per acre stored
in its trees. Derek Davis/Staff Photographer.
Gallaudet changed his management practices voluntarily; he thinks
it's the right thing to do. He worked with a forestry consultant, who
helped with the details. On a recent tour of his woodlot, Gallaudet
highlighted some of the techniques he's using.
Gallaudet's old farm includes a mixed stand of softwoods such as
pine and hemlock, and hardwoods including, oak, maple and birch. The
land is hilly and bisected by a small brook.
Protecting the soil is a top priority. Gallaudet cuts four cords of
firewood each year to help heat his home, and occasional saw logs, if a
stand gets crowded. He uses a small Massey Ferguson tractor with rubber
tires that don't chew up the forest floor. He works when it's dry in
the fall. Shallow ruts are barely visible below the leaf litter, along
an opening where he pulled out logs using a skidding winch mounted on
the rear.
Entering the woodlot, dappled sunlight lit the forest. Overhead,
Gallaudet pointed to the tree canopy. He's careful not to cut too many
trees in one place, which would let the soil dry out.
During a conventional logging operation on a family woodlot, it's
not unusual to clean up the branches and limbs left over from a
harvest, to open the forest floor. Maybe they're sold to be burned in a
biomass energy plant. Gallaudet keeps the slash, taking the time to
create brush piles here and there across his land. They'll decompose
slowly, providing homes for wildlife today and, in time, nutrients for
the forest.
Future Possibilities
On a knoll, orange flagging tape is tied around trees in a sample
plot, noting trunks more than 4" in diameter. That's a first step in
estimating the volume or weight of a tree and how much carbon a forest
can store, based on its species and other factors. Carbon calculators,
(https://fsht.org/forestcarbonproject/forestcarbonproject-calculator/)
such as one linked on the website of the Francis Small Heritage Trust
in Limerick, make the task easier.
Big hardwoods are denser and store the most carbon. Older stands
capture more than new growth. Gallaudet's calculations show that his
woodlot holds roughly 39 tons of carbon per acre, nearly eight times
the carbon footprint of his home and small farm.
Maine small landowners could join forces to maximize carbon storage
and combine their acreage to take advantage of the offset markets, at
least in theory. But the existing markets don't recognize so-called
aggregation, so Sierra Club Maine and other advocates will be looking
at other options in the months ahead.
One idea could be to expand Maine's Tree Growth Tax, the 47 year
old law that reduces property taxes for owners who keep at least 10
acres in commercial timberland. But there are high financial penalties
for removing land from the program, and Doak said the rules are
constantly under assault by interest groups trying to modify them. He
wonders if the Farm and Open Space Tax law, which values land at less
than fair market value if certain requirements are met, might be a
better vehicle.
Another model could be the credits that some major corporations use
to offset their power consumption, by getting a percentage of their
energy from wind power, for instance. Hagerty foresees the possibility
of Maine companies partnering with small woodlot owners, buying local
credits to offset their carbon footprint.
``In a state where people know each other well, that could be
possible,'' he said.

Legacy Roads and Trails Remediation Program (CMLG).
Since its authorization in FY 2008, the Legacy Roads and Trails
program has significantly enhanced the Forest Service's ability to
address key problems associated with its aging and poorly maintained
road system. This includes repairing roads and trails needed for public
access, replacing failed or undersized culverts to improve aquatic
passage and retire unneeded roads to prevent sediment pollution from
entering waterways important for salmon, trout, and other aquatic
species. The program delivers funds to address road problems in real
time, which enables the Forest Service to efficiently plan, design, and
implement restoration treatments. It is a critical tool for leveraging
non-Federal funds resulting in stronger projects and enhanced community
engagement. And because funds primarily go to actual work on the
ground, Legacy Roads and Trails creates high wage jobs for contractors,
including those who specialize in stream restoration, environmental
design, and heavy equipment operation.
From 2008-2018, this unique bipartisan program has invested over
$430 million to the following tangible and accountable results on our
National Forest watersheds:
Maintained and/or storm-proofed 18,057 miles of needed
roads, helping Americans get where they wish to go on Forest
Service lands;
Reclaimed 7,053 miles of unneeded roads, preventing sediment
from entering streams, many of which supply drinking water to
rural and urban towns and cities;
Replaced 1,030 culverts restoring fish passage to 1,671
miles of habitat, aiding the recovery of fish species important
to restoration goals, Tribal communities and sportfishing
enthusiasts;
Improved 5,020 miles of trails, keeping the $535 million
National Forest recreation industry going strong;
Created or maintained 697-1,115 jobs annually across the
nation, bringing dollars and jobs into rural communities;
Saved America's taxpayers $3.5 million per year in road
maintenance costs, promoting a more sustainable Forest Service
road system in the future.
In Washington, D.C. we've seen an interest in rebuilding America's
infrastructure. During these conversations we ask that you encourage
your colleagues to consider the proven track record of success from the
Legacy Roads and Trails program as a model. The program helps adapt the
road system to a more manageable size over time, reducing fiscal and
environmental burdens and enabling the Forest Service to ensure better
and more reliable access. It focuses on the key areas where projects
improve up and downstream connections for salmon, improve water quality
and ensure road/trail resilience in a changing climate. It's a simple
solution to a formidable problem. But it needs funding to succeed.
FY19 was the first year that the Legacy Roads and Trail program was
not specifically funded despite making a difference for Forest Service
watersheds, fish habitat, recreational infrastructure and local jobs
for a decade.
We ask for your support of the program by reinstating Legacy Roads
and Trails as a separate line item in the Fiscal Year (FY) 2020
Interior-Environment Appropriations Bill with a $50M allocation. This
is a small down payment on the growing problem impacting how people
access and experience public lands.
Sincerely,

Submitted Questions
Response from Lenise Lago, Associate Chief, U.S. Forest Service, U.S.
Department of Agriculture
Questions Submitted by Hon. Abigail Davis Spanberger, a Representative
in Congress from Virginia
Question 1. Associate Chief Lago, how does the Forest Service
calculate and classify deferred maintenance?
Answer. The Forest Service determines deferred maintenance for each
asset based on condition assessments conducted at different intervals
depending on the asset. During these assessments, staff collects
information on maintenance and repair needs. Condition surveys for most
assets are performed on a 5 year revolving schedule, except for road
bridges. Road bridges are required to be inspected every 2 years in
accordance with the National Bridge Inspection Standards. Deferred
maintenance for National Forest System (NFS) roads for passenger cars
is determined bi-annually from a random sample. Deferred maintenance
for high clearance/closed roads is not reported at this time.
Question 2. The Forest Service periodically assesses the condition
of its assets in order to estimate deferred maintenance. Please provide
detail on how the agency conducts these assessments, including whether
they differ for the various asset classes (e.g., roads versus
facilities) and the frequency of the assessments.
Answer. The procedures to conduct condition assessments varies
between assets. The assessments occur as follows:
Facilities--Assessments are generally done every 5 years.
Assessments are conducted following the enclosed guidance (see
Facilities Condition Assessment Field Training Guide [see
Attachment 1]);
Roads--A random sample of road segments is surveyed every 2
years using the Deferred Maintenance Protocols for Roads
(enclosed [see Attachment 2]); and
Road Bridges--Inspection reports are done every 2 years as
required by the National Bridge Inspection Standards. Detailed
procedures on how to conduct these inspections can be found in
the Bridge Inspection Guide (BIG).
Trails--A random sample of 1% of Forest Service trails that
are Trail Class 1-4 are assessed each year via the Trail
Assessment and Condition Surveys. All Class 5 trails, those
that are most highly developed, are surveyed every 5 years.
Question 3. The Forest Service receives funding to address deferred
maintenance from several sources. They include discretionary accounts
(e.g., Capital Improvement and Maintenance), mandatory appropriations
(e.g., recreation fees), and other agencies (e.g., the Federal Highway
Administration). Please identify all sources of funding that are used
for deferred maintenance, and the total from all funding sources used
in FY 2018.
Answer. The Forest Service uses different sources of funding to
address deferred maintenance including direct appropriations to the
Capital Improvement and Maintenance account, and external allocations
from the Federal Highway Administration's Federal Lands Transportation
Program and Federal Lands Access Program. The Agency also uses
partnerships to accomplish some of the deferred maintenance work
including cost-share agreements with counties and states, volunteer
work on trail improvement, and via the Good Neighbor Authority. Total
spending from all sources was approximately $230 million in 2018 to
address deferred maintenance directly.
Question 4. Associate Chief Lago, can you speak to the role
individual forests, regional foresters, and headquarters will play in
prioritizing maintenance projects moving forward?
Answer. Prioritization of routine maintenance, including annual
maintenance, and small non-recurring maintenance projects will continue
to be identified, prioritized and managed at the forest level with the
Regional Forester providing guidance and allocating funding based on
the Agency's priorities. The role of the Washington Office is to
communicate agency priorities and develop national policies and
standards to help determine where appropriated dollars should be
allocated for deferred maintenance projects that target larger agency
goals.
Question 5. In the past, Forest Service has needed to transfer
funds from other accounts to help cover the costs of wildfire
suppression. The wildfire funding fix, however, is intended to
eliminate some of the need for fire transfer and is set to take effect
in FY 2020. Has fire transfer affected the Forest Service's ability to
address maintenance needs? If so, in what ways might the wildfire
funding fix alleviate those concerns?
Answer. In the past, funds for maintenance were transferred to
firefighting efforts usually during the summer season, which is also
the time that most of the Agency's maintenance activities are scheduled
to occur, when there are an increased number of seasonal staff for
oversight of activities and favorable weather conditions. When fire
transfers from capital maintenance accounts occurred, planned
maintenance activities were deferred to the following year continuing
the never-ending cycle of deferring maintenance. The wildland fire
suppression funding fix should allow maintenance projects to proceed as
planned, allowing for less deferred maintenance to accumulate.
Question 6. How can the Forest Service enhance public-private
partnerships to address deferred maintenance projects? What is the
staffing level assigned to work on public-private partnerships, how has
that changed in recent years, and is the current staffing level
sufficient to foster and manage additional partnerships?
Answer. With a $5.2 billion deferred maintenance backlog, the
Forest Service recognizes new approaches are needed to address deferred
maintenance and infrastructure priorities on NFS lands. The Agency is
placing a major emphasis on building capacity for public-private
partnerships, with partnership coordinators assigned to every Forest
Service region, and an increasing number of National Forests
designating specific partnership positions. While we do face staffing
capacity challenges due to a workforce that has migrated into wildland
fire related work, partnerships are increasingly important to
accomplish our mission.
Trails maintenance is already highly leveraged within the Forest
Service to maximize maintenance and infrastructure funds. Furthermore,
the Forest Service engages a robust volunteer community that annually
contributes 4.7 million hours of work valued at $120,000,000 with the
help of 110,000 individuals.
Limited capacity to meet competing priorities continues to
challenge the Forest Service to find new ways to meet the needs of an
aging infrastructure. Conservation finance, through Pay for Success and
other funding models, has proven promising in recent pilot projects, as
a way of bringing private sector funding to local recreation projects.
Growing our skills and staffs in partnership collaboration will allow
us to foster new and innovative ways to accomplish work. For example, a
collaborative of local governments in Athens County, Ohio, industry
partners, nonprofits, Quantified Ventures and the Wayne National Forest
are funding sustainable recreation infrastructure by introducing the
first-ever Outdoor Recreation Environmental Impact Bond. Together, the
partners are developing the 88 mile Baileys Trail System on the Wayne
National Forest to revitalize the rural economy of southeast Ohio. The
Baileys Trail System will utilize a mix of new and existing trail
infrastructure on and adjacent to the National Forest to provide new
access to public lands and create new jobs within the Athens County
tourism industry. The Forest Service has partnered with the U.S.
Endowment for Forestry and Communities to implement a grant fund that
hopes to replicate the Baileys Trail System model, among other types of
conservation finance projects, in additional communities that rely on
the National Forest System.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Marcia L. Fudge, a Representative in
Congress from Ohio
Question 1. Ms. Lago, what are the existing pathways for hiring Job
Corps students into the Forest Service?
Answer. The Forest Service is committed to connecting our Job Corps
Civilian Conservation Centers directly to our mission and continuously
improving the performance of our centers and our student outcomes. The
current pathways for hiring our Job Corps students include:
Public Lands Corps Act. The Public Land Corps (PLC) allows
any student completing 640 hours of special conservation
project work under a Natural Resource Agency to apply for a
merit vacancy announcement (open to current Federal employees
and others with competitive eligibility) for up to 2 years upon
program completion. Eligible candidates can be selected for
permanent positions and are provided career-conditional
appointments.
Pathways Program. Students attending any of our five
accredited Job Corps Centers may qualify for the Pathways
special hiring authority if their specific trades align with an
applicable Forest Service position. A student selected under
the Pathways Intern Program must complete 640 paid work hours
and additional training upon Job Corps graduation to be
eligible for conversion into a permanent or Term Forest Service
position. The 640 hours must be performed on a unit-school
program hours do not count toward eligibility. In addition,
students who have completed an accredited trades program within
the last 2 years or are within 9 months of graduation may be
selected under the Pathways Recent Graduate Program for a
Forest Service position. Those who have not yet graduated will
be appointed upon graduation.
Schedule A or Veterans Recruitment Action (VRA). Students
who qualify for Schedule A (disability hiring) or VRA may be
hired non-competitively, by applying to a vacancy announcement
or other recruitment avenues, such as non-competitive direct
appointment.
Direct Hire Authority for Firefighters. On August 8, 2019,
the Office of Personnel Management authorized the Forest
Service to use a direct hire authority to assist in meeting
critical hiring needs in support of the FY 2020 wildland
firefighting season. This authority enables the Forest Service
to streamline the hiring process for permanent and temporary
firefighting positions. Every civilian conservation center
supports a wildland fire program, training students to serve as
firefighters. Eligible, qualifying students can be hired
directly upon graduation into Federal firefighter positions.
Question 1a. What does that process look like for a Job Corps
student?
Answer. Every center has a student advisor who assists students in
creating their resumes and applying for positions under the PLC
authority or any other authority they qualify for when applying for a
Forest Service job. To date, the PLC program has resulted in over 200
students completing internships that led to receiving a non-competitive
hiring authority preference. Of those students, approximately 20 have
been placed into permanent, full-time positions with the Forest
Service.
Question 1b. Are students made aware of opportunities within the
Forest Service?
Answer. Yes. Students who are interested in Forest Service careers
learn about those opportunities through the Job Corps Program. Students
compete for internship opportunities with the Forest Service, and if
they are successful, they complete a 4 month work experience and
receive non-competitive application preference status. This status
gives students a competitive advantage for permanent Forest Service
positions.
Question 2. You mentioned that the Forest Service is interested in
working with OPM to create a direct hiring authority for Job Corps
students. What is the status of this effort currently?
Answer. The Forest Service Job Corps National Office is working to
assemble and approve the appropriate materials through USDA and OPM
that will provide:
Direct hiring authority for Job Corps graduates under the
Public Land Corps Authority that is similar to the direct
hiring authority available for Resource Assistants.
Special hiring authority for Job Corps graduates that is
similar to the special hiring authority for AmeriCorps and
Peace Corps.
Question 3. What activities are Civilian Conservation Corps
students trained to assist with? How does that help to reduce the
deferred maintenance backlog?
Answer. Student trades include a variety of construction,
information technology, and natural resource trades. Construction
trades include carpentry, facilities maintenance, masonry, bricklaying,
painting, welding, operation of heavy equipment, and floor-covering.
Center students perform work on their local unit. In the last 2 years,
this work has contributed a total of almost $3 million in deferred
maintenance projects.
Question 4. You mentioned that the Forest Service is interested in
expanding the conservation trades to all of the Job Corps centers. When
do you expect to make that expansion? What impact could that have on
the deferred maintenance backlog?
Answer. Currently ten trades directly align with Forest Service
conservation work, including forestry, fire suppression, and dispatch.
The Forest Service is working to increase the alignment through an
expansion of conservation-related training curricula. Centers will also
work directly with their local National Forests to fully integrate
their curricula into the Forest's annual program of work. In addition,
each Center will be represented on their local National Forest's
leadership team and will participate in the planning of work for the
districts in their forest. Students will take part in work-based
learning on National Forests and in communities, including facilities
maintenance. The value of these projects could eventually add up to
millions of dollars but will still be far less than what would be
needed to appreciably slow the growth of deferred maintenance across
the agency.
We welcome the opportunity to update the Committee on our efforts
to strengthen Job Corps.
Question Submitted by Hon. Tom O'Halleran, a Representative in Congress
from Arizona
Question. In Arizona, road and trail repair needs account for
nearly 50% of the deferred maintenance backlog on Federal lands. Lack
of road and trail access to Federal public lands reduces visitation and
limits opportunities for recreation, impacting the economy of gateway
communities. Understanding this, our local governments have stepped up
to play their part in maintaining roads and other access points. 70% of
the 2,100 vehicles using Lake Mary road each day are due to
recreational traffic. For nearly a century, Coconino county has
maintained this road through a combination of funds, including local
taxes. Has the Forest Service explored similar partnerships with local
governments and does the forest service see this or other existing
partnerships as potential models for tackling deferred maintenance?
Answer. The cooperative road maintenance agreement as described
above is widely used on Forest Service transportation systems across
the country. This mechanism is actively used and promoted to allow
other public entities to participate in maintenance of routes critical
to local communities. Other methods of public-public partnerships are
also employed and encouraged by the Forest Service. One example of
these partnerships is the agreement between the Tennessee Valley
Authority (TVA) and the Forest Service under which TVA performs
inspections of Forest Service road bridges to meet the requirement
under the National Bridge Inspection Standards for a quality assurance
check of Forest Service road bridges by an external agency.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Chellie Pingree, a Representative in
Congress from Maine
Question 1. The Forest Service has an FY 2020 list of 25 Land and
Water Conservation Fund priority projects for acquisition, and 22 for
Forest Legacy. These projects would likely be funded under anticipated
appropriations for next year, but the agency has unmet needs beyond the
current list of projects. Based on need alone, how many acquisition and
Forest Legacy projects would the agency need to pursue? Can your agency
quantify the backlog, and say how many projects beyond the list could
improve management and reduce costs, if LWCF was more fully funded?
Answer. Each year, Forest Legacy Program (FLP) projects are
selected through a two-stage competitive process. The first stage is
state-level identification and approval. After a project is selected at
the state level, the second stage is a national level project review
conducted by a panel of representatives from states participating in
the FLP and the Forest Service. This two-stage process results in high-
quality projects that are supported both locally and nationally.
For FY 2020, 36 projects, with a total request of $123 million,
were submitted for consideration through the FLP. Some of these
projects received funding when FY 2019 appropriations were enacted,
while some of the proposed projects were no longer viable.
Maine has been an active participant in the FLP at 741,000 acres.
In terms of funds, Maine has received $76,061,534, which is second only
to Montana, which has received $77,405,533.
For land acquisition, the Forest Service works with a variety of
non-governmental organizations and willing sellers from the general
public. In Fiscal Year 2020, Congress appropriated $57,639,000 for
purchase of lands from willing sellers in 18 states. The acquisition
projects are prioritized based on: (1) the significance of the
acquisition; (2) the urgency of the acquisition; (3) management
efficiencies; (4) management cost savings; (5) geographic distribution;
(6) threats to the integrity of the land; and (7) the recreational
value of the land. The Forest Service's nine regions hold competitions
to cull the projects from units within the region's National Forests
and Grasslands, then submit top projects to the Washington Office (WO)
for a national competition. The WO competition results in a smaller
list of projects that is submitted to Congress, which determines the
amount of appropriations for the projects.
Question 2. Based on budget documents that I have received from
USDA, I understand the Forest Service spent $3.3 million on the climate
hubs in 2016, which I think is great, but the 2019 estimate is
$400,000. Given the challenges that we are dealing with, why is there
such a big drop, and do you see those as a valuable part of what you
are doing?
Answer. In FY 2016, the Forest Service allocated $3.3 million for
Climate Hubs. The Forest Service allocated $1.85 million per year for
both FY 2017 and FY 2018. In FY 2019, Climate Hub allocation was $1.665
million and has been budgeted to remain at this level for FY 2020. The
funding drop is reflective of prioritization of urgent forest
restoration program and project work. However, the agency continues to
support many important initiatives through our multiple Research and
Development programs.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Cynthia Axne, a Representative in Congress
from Iowa
Question 1. The Forest Service supplies water for agriculture and
communities and is a major economic driver for many forest dependent
communities. In fact, National Forest System lands are the nation's
largest source of municipal drinking water supply, serving more than 66
million people. Ms. Lago, please speak to the importance of these
systems to the environment, public health, and safety. Can you speak to
the current condition of Forest Service water systems?
Answer. The Forest Service continues to foster conditions for
clean, abundant water to help ensure the productive and sustainable use
of National Forest System lands. The Agency emphasizes reforestation
and revegetation efforts. Restoring ecosystems ensures that vital
amenities, such as clean water, are available to society. In FY 2018,
the Agency targeted investments in the National Best Management
Practices Program to improve tools to meet agency requirements under
the Clean Water Act and other statutes to protect clean water. The
program made advancements to increase the speed and accuracy of use and
sharing of data with state water quality agencies, the Environmental
Protection Agency, and other partners.
The Forest Service owns and operates over 4,700 drinking water
systems, of which over 30% are in poor or fair condition. Thirty-six
percent of all drinking water systems are more than 50 years old with
escalating repair costs every year. With a current water system
deferred maintenance backlog of $93 million, the impact of not
addressing this will affect the ability for the public and employees to
access recreation facilities, fire, administration and other
facilities.
Question 2. We recognize that restoration and maintenance of our
National Forests can be a source of long-term, sustainable jobs in
rural communities. Studies have indicated that for every $1 million
spent on forest watershed restoration, 14.5 jobs can be generated. Can
you provide references to studies documenting the impact of
infrastructure improvements on jobs?
Answer. Federal agencies examined job contributions of
infrastructure improvements with the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009 (ARRA) consistent with goals of the act, specifically, to
preserve and create jobs and stimulate economic recovery. Further, USDA
agencies used a common general framework for estimating the potential
effects of the ARRA using concepts and techniques embodied in a tool
called IMPLAN. Infrastructure investments by USDA Rural Development in
community facilities, water and waste, rural business support, single
family housing support, broadband and Rural Development Salary resulted
in 16 jobs per $1 million invested (USDA NRCS, 2010). Infrastructure
investments by USDA Farm Service Agency in information technology
resulted in 22 jobs per $1 million invested (USDA NRCS, 2010). A 2010
study partially funded by the Forest Service indicated that forest and
watershed restoration activities have the potential to create an
average of 14 jobs per $1 million invested (M. Nielsen-Pincus and C.
Moseley, 2010). A more recent study published by the Public Library of
Science, cites up to 33 jobs per $1 million invested from environmental
restoration, restoration-related conservation, and mitigation actions
(BenDor, et al., 2015). Infrastructure investments by USDA Natural
Resource Conservation Service in floodplain, dam and other projects
resulted in 220 jobs per $1 million invested (USDA NRCS 2010). Recent
examination of Forest Service investment in over $3 billion in
infrastructure indicates that 35,000 to 38,000 jobs annually could be
sustained across the nation, or 11 to 12 jobs per $1 million invested
(USDA Forest Service, 2017). In addition, a 2017 analysis of Forest
Service resource management investments ($5.9 billion) in program areas
such as infrastructure construction and maintenance, firefighting,
ecosystem restoration, research and development, fuels treatments, Job
Corps, salaries, etc. contributed 120,620 jobs across the nation; or 20
jobs per $1 million invested (USDA Forest Service, 2019).

Questions Submitted by Hon. Kim Schrier, a Representative in Congress
from Washington
Capital Improvement Plan Projects
Question 1. What considerations are made to narrow down the list of
projects submitted that meet the national priorities outlined?
Answer. The primary considerations for selecting and ranking
capital improvement projects are how the projects support our current
priorities including the following benefit areas: active management,
access to recreation, economic benefits, fire operations, environment
and sustainability, and research and technology. In addition, project
criticality and readiness are also considered when scheduling
implementation.
Question 2. Are Regions allocated a percentage of the CIP budget
based on need, miles of road, acres of Forest Service land? Or are
simply the top number of projects funded?
Answer. Regions are allocated funds for operations and maintenance
based on a distribution formula that includes miles of roads,
visitation, timber volume targets and others. Since 2017, the Forest
Service has set aside a small portion of the Capital Improvement and
Maintenance (CI&M) account for Roads and Facilities to fund competitive
Capital Improvement Plan (CIP) and Decommissioning projects.
Question 3. Given that the states with the highest concentration of
deferred repairs are: California, Montana, Idaho, Oregon, Colorado, and
Washington, respectively, will these states be allocated larger
proportion of the CIP budget due to their needs?
Answer. In general, these states get a large portion of CI&M
funding for operations and maintenance. However, the national CIP
project competition focuses on project specific cost-benefit ratio
rather than accumulated deferred maintenance. The reduction of deferred
maintenance as result of implementing a project is a desired outcome.
Question 4. How are Regional priorities considered? For example, in
Region 6, if improving Chinook salmon habitat and removing fish passage
barriers is of utmost priority, what weight will that be given in the
national priorities?
Answer. The CIP model used to rank and prioritize project uses
quantitative metrics and criticality scoring. Although the regional
ranking of projects is not used in the calculation of the final score,
it would be taken into consideration. Before finalizing the CIP list of
projects for each fiscal year the Asset Management Review Board (AMRB)
would make necessary adjustments to ensure that regional and national
priorities are in alignment.
Legacy Roads and Trails Program
Question 5. What direction are you providing to Regional Offices to
Legacy Roads and Trails program projects are implemented and tracked?
Answer. While the Legacy Roads and Trails Program was retired from
our budget line items starting in FY 2018, the Forest Service continues
to plan, implement and track projects which meet the goals of this
formerly dedicated funding mechanism.
Question 6. Is the USFS continuing to track and report annual
accomplishments under the program?
Answer. The Forest Service continues to track accomplishments from
transportation projects that improve watershed conditions, including
bettering streams for water quality and aquatic organisms.
Question 7. Across National Forest lands in OR/WA, 6,000 stream
miles are designated as critical habitat for federally listed fish, and
5,550 stream miles have been listed as water quality impaired under the
Federal Clean Water Act of 1972. What management improvements does the
USFS need to make to ensure waters are removed from the listings?
Answer. The Forest Service established a Watershed Condition
Framework to provide a consistent, comparable, and credible process for
improving the health of watersheds on National Forests and Grasslands
in 2011. The Pacific Northwest Region continues to focus on the
priority watersheds and choose projects to fund that improve watershed
conditions, including bettering streams for water quality and aquatic
organisms.
Question 8. How will the USFS meet its obligations to protect water
quality and salmon in my state?
Answer. The Pacific Northwest Region continues to leverage existing
and new partnerships to invest in watershed improvement projects that
address water quality and aquatic organism passage.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Jimmy Panetta, a Representative in Congress
from California
Question 1. The Nacimiento-Fergusson Road is a 24 mile long Forest
Service road in the Los Padres National Forest. When Big Sur residents
face inclement weather like mudslides and wildfires that cause road
failures on Highway 1, the Nacimiento-Fergusson road is the only way
they can get out of the Big Sur region. After storms in 2017 that shut
down Highway 1, there were hundreds of people who had no way to get out
of Big Sur. At the same time, the Nacimiento-Fergusson road has
suffered as a result of the Forest Service's maintenance backlog.
Associate Chief Lago, once the Wildfire Funding Fix is implemented in
Fiscal Year 2020, would you be willing to continue this dialogue and
work with me to ensure the Big Sur community can access much-needed
funding to for deferred maintenance on their roads?
Answer. Yes, the implementation of the Wildfire Funding Fix is
going to allow the agency to be more efficient in addressing
infrastructure needs and to better plan long term solutions to address
the deferred maintenance backlog.
Question 2. In Los Padres National Forest, our deferred maintenance
exceeds $24 million. My question is where does that lie relative to
other National Forests?
Answer. Los Padres National Forest deferred maintenance is
consistent with other National Forests. We have enclosed a file with
more detailed information on the deferred maintenance for all units of
the National Forest System [see Attachment 3].
Question 3. The State of California prides itself on technological
innovation. I am consistently impressed when I see the innovation in
our agricultural fields, from robotic harvesters to agricultural drones
that monitor crop growth. Can you speak to any Forest Service
investments in technology, including drones, satellites, and fire
surveillance cameras?
Answer. The Forest Service is actively involved in leveraging
leading edge technology to support decision-making at all levels of the
Forest Service from the field, to the regional offices, and to the
Washington Office. The FY 2021 Forest Service budget proposes $5
million to be used to implement the Wildfire Technology Modernization
section of the Dingell Conservation and Management Act (2019).
Implementation includes the development of a common, single display of
all fire resources and will significantly increase accountability for
how the agency uses assets. This will allow the agency to monitor,
analyze, and evaluate how tactical decisions and resource utilization
influences incident outcomes. This information will create a feedback
loop, allowing the agency to learn where, when, and how resources are
most effective. When combined with the Risk Management Assistance
framework, technology modernization for fire resources will enable
improvement in the efficient use of agency resources through early,
risk-based decision-making with State and local partners and through
transparent deployment of assets. The Forest Service is accelerating
adoption of new technologies to modernize the wildland fire system,
consistent with direction provided in the Dingell Act. Technology is
key not only for real-time incident management, but also to be able to
learn where and when resources are most effective. That learning will
be key for improved deployment in the future that will reduce risk to
responders and be more cost-effective. Investments in technology
include (among others):
UAS (drones). The Forest Service began evaluating UAS in
2003, and we now have an established Forest Service--UAS
Program Office to manage, support and expand the use of this
revolutionary capability. We are actively leveraging UAS
technologies to support a number of business needs including
fire/disaster support, engineering fieldwork (infrastructure
inspection and assessment), invasive species mapping, and
environmental cleanup. The Forest Service has also started
testing the use of drones to perform bridge inspection. The use
of UAS provides new data streams, saves time, and improves
personnel safety in the field.
Satellite Imagery. The Forest Service heavily leverages the
use of imagery from Federal-civil and commercial satellites to
support traditional mapping (paper and digital maps) and fire/
disaster support. The remote sensing community continues to
evaluate and incorporate new sensor data streams as they come
online. The Forest Service is a significant user of commercial
high-resolution satellite imagery, which is provided at no cost
to Federal-civil agencies by the National Geospatial-
Intelligence Agency.
Fire Surveillance Cameras. Federal, state and local fire
managers are increasingly relying on both airborne and ground
(fixed) fire surveillance cameras. The Forest Service is
actively pursuing automated smoke detection in the networked
ground surveillance cameras, as well as the use of UAS, new
thermal infrared cameras and the use of national systems to
support improved fire detection (and reporting) and active fire
management.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Doug LaMalfa, a Representative in Congress
from California
Question 1. Timber receipts have been down. Back years ago, we are
looking at 1991, we could see that there is $680 million in timber
receipts, of which ten percent goes directly towards forest roads, and
it is also very important, those receipts, for local schools and roads
under what is the Secure Rural Schools Fund. And so, now you want $680
million in receipts, and more recently, it is down to $21 million. So,
it would seem to me we could be going farther if we had the timber
receipts for the road maintenance for that ten percent.
Would you comment upon that?
Question 1a. Do you know that number now compared to the $680
million not-inflation-adjusted 1991 number?
Answer 1-1a. The 2014-2018 5 year average of timber receipts was
$32.8 million (see Table [1] below), as compared to the $686.6 million
sold, $845.7 million in receipts, and $84.57 million in ``Purchaser
Road Credits'' in 1991. This 5 year average is roughly 4% of the 1991
timber receipts. In 1991, the Forest Service changed from collecting
``Purchaser Road Credits'' to the ``Specified Road Costs'' approach to
maintaining Forest Service Roads above the standards necessary for
timber harvest. As in the past, where the road maintenance credits were
10% of the receipts, we are very close to that same rate today, as we
calculate the road costs to be 9% of total receipts.

Under Forest Service Manual (FSM 2432.34a), the Purchaser pays for
the cost of building a road to the standard needed for consistency with
applicable environmental laws and regulations and as needed for timber
harvest. If the sale contract provides for road design standards in
excess of those needed for the harvest and removal of timber from that
sale, including measures to protect adjacent resource values, provision
shall be made in the contract for compensating the Purchaser for the
additional costs, unless the Purchaser elects Government construction
under section 14(i) of the National Forest Management Act of 1976. In
the absence of supplemental funds, the sale would need to be redesigned
or rescheduled.
The FY 2020 and FY 2021 Forest Service budget proposes to use the
Roads and Trails for States fund, without regard to the state in which
the amounts were derived, to repair or reconstruct roads, bridges, and
trails on National Forest System lands or to carry out and administer
projects to improve forest health conditions. This work may include the
repair or reconstruction of roads, bridges, and trails on National
Forest System lands in the wildland-community interface where there is
an abnormally high risk of fire.
Question 2. When we were talking about the backlog, when we are
seeing the Forest Service absorbing more lands through donations from
maybe NGOs or other instances, or the LWCF has also introduced more
land back into Forest Service control. How is that contributing to the
backlog and your ability to keep up, and as well as updating this $5.2
billion backlog figure?
Answer. The Forest Service has a policy not to acquire properties
that will increase deferred maintenance requirements when LWCF funds
are utilized. Naturally, there is a long-term maintenance cost to the
agency to own any acre of land or asset within the National Forest
System.
Question Submitted by Hon. Rick W. Allen, a Representative in Congress
from Georgia
Question. In your written testimony, you mentioned that perhaps
most critically, forest infrastructure provides fire protection for
communities, especially by providing access to forest lands and roads
for firefighters and emergency responders during rescue operations.
Due to the deferred maintenance backlog, how many miles of Forest
Service system roads have been decommissioned over the past 10 years?
Answer. Historically, the Forest Service has had a targeted road
mile decommissioning strategy in order to minimize resource damage to
the landscape caused by the presence of built infrastructure. The table
below presents those targets and associated decommissioning
accomplishments. It should be noted that the targets and
accomplishments include both System and non-System mileage. System
roads are roads inventoried, maintained and managed by the Forest
Service. Non-System roads are roads within National Forest System
boundaries, but which are not Forest Service roads. Until FY 2013,
System and non-System miles were not reported separately.

Acknowledgments
The authors deeply appreciate the contributions of Steve Oravetz,
Bruce Crockett, Randy Warbington, and Mark McDonough, who were the lead
developers of the Forest Service Condition Assessment system and
provided advice about and information for this publication. The authors
also thank the many Forest Service employees who provided great photos
of facilities, especially those who responded to specific item
requests. The authors thank the editors and visual information
specialists for turning the rough draft into a polished field guide.
The Facility Condition Assessment Form
This training guide is a memory-jogger that you can take with you
as you perform facility condition assessments. It contains the same
items in the same order as the complex facility condition assessment
form that is used to record work items for entry into the Natural
Resources Manager (NRM) Infra database. Use this guide to perform
condition assessments in a manner consistent with those performed by
other inspectors throughout the Forest Service.
Keep in mind that facility condition assessments are only intended
to record major facility maintenance needs. Performing operations work
and minor maintenance work on a regular basis is important, but such
work is not recorded through the facility condition assessment process.
The National Technology and Development Program (T&D) report ``So
That's Why It's Always Cold in Here: A Guide for Conducting Facilities
Condition Assessment Surveys'' (0473-2839-MTDC), provides detailed
guidance for inspecting buildings and associated assets to determine
their condition and what work is needed to correct deficiencies,
including operations and minor maintenance. The report is available in
printed form from the Missoula Technology and Development Center (MTDC)
or electronically at http://fsweb.mtdc.wo.fs.fed.us/php/
library_card.php?p_num=0473 2839.
This guide does not explain how to properly conduct condition
assessments on Forest Service buildings. You will need to take the
7100--Basic Building Condition Assessment and Work Items or 7300--
Complex Building Condition Survey Training course in person or through
AgLearn before using this guide in the field.
This guide does not explain how to use the NRM Infra database.
Please see your supervisor and forest NRM specialist if you need more
information about NRM or role assignments to access and modify data in
the NRM Infra database.
Before using this guide in the field, print the condition
assessment form for each building using the NRM Infra report
BLDSRV01JRL: Facility Condition Assessment Form (figure 1). NRM Infra
automatically populates the header information for the printed form,
except for the inspector signature, inspection date, and inspector
name. Check to ensure that you've printed the appropriate form (complex
versus basic building) and that the header information is accurate.
Figure 1
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Part of the Facility Condition Assessment Form for the
Missoula Technology and Development Center office/lab/shop.
Be sure to check the gross square feet (Gross SqFt) of the building
to ensure that it is correct. Compute gross square feet using physical
or as-built plan measurements to the outside faces of exterior walls
for all stories of the building. Don't include crawl spaces or areas
with less than a 3 clear ceiling height. Don't include the open air
over a double height room as part of the floor above; count only the
floor area that can be walked on. Do include excavated basement areas,
indoor mechanical spaces, mezzanines, penthouses and attics with
floors, garages, covered porches (with or without walls), balconies you
can stand on, and interior or covered corridors or walkways. Do include
the footprints of stairways, elevator shafts, and vertical duct shafts
as gross area on each floor through which they pass. If this
explanation is confusing, more details and sketches showing how these
rules are applied to a building are available at the U. S. Department
of Education's Facilities Inventory and Classification Manual Web page
http://nces.ed.gov/pubs2006/ficm/
content.asp?ContentType=Section&chapter=3&section=2&subsection=1.
All work item costs automatically populate when your inspection
data is entered into the NRM Infra database. The costs include the RS
Means estimated cost multiplied by 1.10 for design costs, by 1.10 for
contracting costs, and by 1.15 for overhead costs. The RS Means costs
are updated each year to match the current national average costs of
the work.
A multiplier is also applied to all work items to account for the
increasing costs as the distance increases from the building to the
nearest town with contractors and supplies. The multiplier is based on
the Estimated Travel Time (Hrs) value that is entered on the Building
Details screen in the NRM Infra database. The multiplier is 1.0 for 1
hour of travel time, 1.5 for 2 hours, 2.0 for 4 hours, 3.0 for 8 hours,
and 4.0 for more than 8 hours of travel time. The estimated travel time
is shown in the Facility Condition Assessment Form header. Check this
value for accuracy. If it is inaccurate, correct it on the Buildings
screen before entering work items.
Another multiplier, 1.5, is automatically applied to all work items
for buildings with Historic Status in the NRM Infra database of
EVALUATED/MEETS (has been evaluated and meets National Register
criteria), IN/PENDING (included in the National Register of Historic
Places or on a pending list), or MEETS AGE/FRTHR (more than 50 years
old, but requires further evaluation). The Facility Condition
Assessment Form header shows the Historic Status. Check this value for
accuracy. If it is inaccurate, correct it on the Buildings screen
before entering work items.
Whether you are assessing a complex or basic building, all the
standard work items are on the Facility Condition Assessment Form.
Complex buildings have 62 standard work items and simple buildings have
16 standard work items. This guide addresses each work item in the same
order as on the printed complex building form. If you are inspecting a
basic building, ignore the work items in this guide that are not on
your form.
Filling in the Facility Condition Assessment Form
You will need to physically inspect each building and fill in
Quantity, Reason, and Date Needed for each item that requires repair,
and check the box in the Critical column, if necessary. The cost for
each item self-populates from an interface with the current edition of
RS Means Building Construction Cost Data when the information from the
printed form is entered electronically into the NRM Infra database.
Quantity of work must be measured, calculated, or counted, unless
the preprinted unit is LS (lump sum). If the unit is LS, the quantity
is always ``1'' if the work is needed and ``0'' if no work is needed.
Other units of measure are:
CSF: 100 square feet
EA: each
LF: linear feet
MSF: 1,000 square feet
M.S.F.: 10,000 square feet
SF: square feet
SQ: 100 square feet
STEP, EA: stair riser
SYSTEM: each complete system
To calculate square feet, measure the length and width (or length
and height for vertical surfaces) in feet, then multiply length by
width (or length by height). CSF, MSF, SQ, and M.S.F. are variants of
SF, and are explained further under items using these units of measure.
Do not confuse M.S.F. with MSF. Available fonts prevented use of the
Roman numeral for 10,000 on the form. Designating 10,000 square feet as
M.S.F. was the workaround.
The Reason column identifies the reason for performing the work. It
contains only three choices:
1.
Resource protection work items must be performed to avoid damage,
obstruction, or negative impact to a natural or cultural
resource.
2.
Mission work items must be completed to ensure the ability of
employees to carry out the Forest Service mission. Needs
are related to administration and providing services
(transportation, recreation, grazing, etc.) that do not
fall into the H&S or Resource categories.
3.
Health and safety (H&S) work items are necessary to address
immediate threats to human health and safety.
In the Date Needed column, you normally should write in the last
day of the fiscal year in which the work needs to be performed.
Check the box in the Critical column only if completion of the work
item is necessary to correct a serious and immediate threat to health
or safety, a natural or cultural resource, or the ability of the Forest
Service to carry out its mission. Other work items necessary to address
potential risks to public or employee safety or health; compliance with
codes, standards, regulations, etc.; or needs that address potential
adverse consequences to natural resources or mission accomplishment are
considered non-critical. For example:
Complying with Notices of Violation (Occupational Safety and
Health Administration [OSHA], Environmental Protection Agency
[EPA], etc.) is a critical health and safety need.
Preventing irreversible damage to or loss of a historic
structure is a critical resource protection need.
Providing accessibility for people with disabilities is a
non-critical health and safety need.
Complying with Federal, State, and local building codes is a
non-critical health and safety need.
Making modifications to accommodate increased visitation is
a non-critical mission need.
Energy efficiency or renewable energy retrofits are a non-
critical mission need.
Please DO check your data to ensure that everything is entered
correctly, including the unit of measure.
Inspection Tips
Experienced inspectors provided the following tips to help you
perform a quicker, more effective inspection.
Use two people to survey large labs or office buildings. One
person can measure while the other records.
Use a set of as-built plans (if available) to count light
fixtures, windows, etc.
If you don't have as-built plans, sketch a simple floor plan
as you inspect to show doors, windows, flooring types, and
dimensions. Keep the sketch in the building file for future
reference.
Builders often use rules of thumb to estimate quantities.
You can, too, where it seems prudent. For instance:
b Multiply the gross square feet of the finished area of a house by
4.5 for a good approximation of the total square feet of
gypsum board that would be needed to completely replace the
gypsum board inside the house. If the garage is a full-
finish structure, multiply its square footage by 2.25 and
then add the result to the house total. A reasonable
multiplier for small office buildings is 3.2.
These estimating multipliers also work for repainting
the entire interior.
b Each region has a cooling ratio that is either implied or
dictated by the local building officials. The ratio states
how many square feet can be conditioned per ton of cooling.
If you know this ratio, you can easily estimate the tons of
cooling capacity needed for the building.
Use the adjustment factors shown in table 1 to figure
the roof area on the
slope, if you know the roof pitch and the horizontal area
covered by the roof
(including overhangs). Multiply the covered area by the
adjustment factor.
Table 1

------------------------------------------------------------------------
After entering the work items into the NRM Infra database,
check your entered data to ensure that you entered everything
correctly and that you used the unit of measure the work item
requires.
b Enter roofing and siding quantities in 100 square feet units
(CSF), not square feet units (SF).
b Enter parking lot seal coat in 10,000 square feet units (M.S.F.),
and parking lot resurfacing in 1,000 square feet units
(MSF).
A work item is deferred maintenance if the material has been
in place longer than the typical life cycle listed on the page
for each work item. A carpet that was installed in 2000 and
inspected in 2012 was 12 years old when inspected. Because the
life cycle for carpeting is 8 years, replacing the carpet would
be considered deferred maintenance using the Forest Service
standard, even if the carpet was still in good condition.
Whether you agree with this logic or not, please conform to the
standard so our practices remain uniform and defensible.
A list of survey tools a facility inspector may wish to take
along to increase efficiency when performing condition
assessment inspections is available at http://
fsweb.wo.fs.fed.us/eng/programs/facilities/documents/
ToolList.doc.
Work Items
The remainder of this guide consists of information about the
standard work items. Each work item has its own page that includes a
photo or two depicting the item as well as information to help you
decide whether the item applies to the building you're inspecting, how
often this work normally is needed, and how to measure and record the
quantity of work. This guide includes much of the information included
in the ``Building Work Items Data Dictionary'' http://
fsweb.wo.fs.fed.us/eng/programs/facilities/documents/
BldgsWIDDictionary.pdf.
In the interest of minimizing the number of work items, similar
work is sometimes grouped together under a single work item. The actual
replacement costs for these similar items aren't identical, so a
representative cost is used. The work item title may not reflect the
range of work covered by the item. Check the considerations bullets for
more information about the work included in the item.
If the standard work items don't cover needed major maintenance
work, you may need to create a custom work item, as explained following
the standard work item pages.
Notes
Work Item 01001--Building Replacement, Complete
Definition: Remove and replace an entire building (figures 2 and
3).
Unit of Measure: lump sum (LS).
Typical Life Cycle: 50 years.
A well constructed and maintained building can last several
hundred years, and a poorly constructed and maintained building
may become unusable in a decade or 2. Base the replacement
decision on the condition and function and not the age of the
building.
Considerations:
Replacement is justified if a building is still needed, but:
b Deferred maintenance costs exceed the current replacement value
shown in the NRM Infra database.
b The building becomes functionally obsolete.
b The building cannot be modified to meet accessibility standards.
Check the Facilities Master Plan (FMP) to see whether the
building is needed.
Decide whether this work item is appropriate based on the
FMP decision and the building's condition.
If this item is selected, DO NOT record any other work items
for this building.

The old barn's foundation posts are leaning and the door is
propped open with a board braced against the ground.
This old barn is in extremely poor condition. If the
Facilities Master Plan shows a continuing need for barn or
storage space here, the barn should be replaced. If not, the
barn should be removed.
Figure 3

with a fiberglass roof, The building is only about 4 wide by
4 deep. Green algae is growing up the siding from the concrete
slab foundation and there are holes in the bottom of the siding
in three places.
Buildings that can't be modified to meet accessibility
requirements need to be replaced, if the function they provide
is still required. This outhouse is too small to provide the
required turning space.
Work Item 02001--Parking Lot, Repair and Seal Coating (per 10,000 S.F.)
Definition: Perform minor repairs, apply emulsified asphalt seal
coat to the asphalt-paved surface, and paint traffic and parking
markings (figure 4).
Unit of Measure: 10,000 square feet (M.S.F.).
To determine the number of units, calculate the total area
in square feet, then divide by 10,000. Round to the nearest
tenth. Enter this number as the quantity. Example: 67,543 SF &
10,000 (SF per M.S.F.) = 6.7543 M.S.F. Rounded to the nearest
tenth = 6.8 M.S.F.
Typical Life Cycle: 5 years.
Considerations:
Includes thoroughly cleaning the surface, patching holes,
filling cracks, applying two coats of petroleum emulsion, and
restriping the parking lot.
Includes asphalt seal only, not chip seal; use a custom item
for chip seal.
Asphalt parking lots need to be maintained with an
emulsified asphalt seal coat about every 5 years to maximize
pavement life.
Use only for pavement associated with a building, not a
road.
Use only for parking lots that are in relatively good
condition.
Figure 4
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of an asphalt parking lot with faded parking
delineation paint and a few cracks that have been coated with
tar.
This supervisor's office parking lot is in pretty good
condition, but could use a seal and repainting.
Work Item 02002--Parking Lot, Repair and Resurface
Definition: Repair defects, place 2" thick asphalt pavement overlay
on asphalt-paved surfaces, and paint traffic and parking markings
(figure 5).
Unit of Measure: 1,000 square feet (MSF).
To determine the number of units, calculate the total area
in square feet, then divide by 1,000. Round to the nearest
tenth. Example: 485 SF & 1,000 SF per MSF = 0.485 MSF. Rounded
to the nearest tenth = 0.5 MSF.
Typical Life Cycle: 10 years.
Asphalt pavement may last much longer if properly
maintained.
Considerations:
Includes thoroughly cleaning the surface, patching holes,
filling cracks, applying an emulsion tack coat, laying an
asphaltic concrete wearing course, and restriping the lot.
Use only for pavement associated with a building, not a
road.
Use when the aggregate base is generally sound but the
asphalt is broken up, has potholes, and, in general, is in poor
but salvageable condition.
Figure 5
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of an area paved with asphalt in poor condition behind
two buildings.
The raveling, developing potholes, and alligatoring on this
parking lot and driveway can't be cured by a seal coat; it
should have an asphalt overlay.
Work Item 02003--Concrete, Sidewalk or Curb, Remove/Replace
Definition: Replace concrete or asphalt curbs (figure 6) or
sidewalks (figure 7).
Unit of Measure: linear feet (LF) of sidewalk or curb.
Sidewalk only: measure linear feet to the nearest foot for a
sidewalk that is 24" to 48" wide. If the sidewalk is wider than
48", record proportionally more length.
Curb only: measure linear feet to the nearest foot.
Both sidewalk and curb: measure linear feet of each to the
nearest foot and add the lengths together.
Typical Life Cycle: 25 years.
Concrete typically has a long life, but may become degraded
because of overloading or poor initial construction. Continued
exposure to freeze-thaw cycles may shift alignment vertically
or horizontally, creating tripping hazardsand making surfaces
nonaccessible.
Considerations:
Includes removing the existing sidewalk or curb, placing a
3" thick, vibratory-plate-compacted aggregate base and a 4"
thick, broom-finished concrete sidewalk or formed curb with
gutter.
Does not include repair work, such as patching or grinding,
which is minor maintenance.
Figure 6
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a section of concrete curb and gutter at the edge of
an asphalt-paved parking lot. The concrete is cracked about
every 2, with chipping and spalling at most of the cracks.
This curb and gutter are deteriorating and no longer provide
good drainage flow, so they should be replaced.
Figure 7
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of two sidewalks leading to the back door of a wood-
sided Forest Service residence. The left sidewalk is
perpendicular to the bade wall of the house and has an 1\1/2\"
high ``step'' where the walk cracked and part of it settled.
The right sidewalk is parallel to the back wall of the house
and has a 2" wide gap in the concrete at a joint where the
sidewalk separated.
Two short sections of this sidewalk should be replaced to
correct the vertical alignment shift on the left and the
horizontal shift on the right. Use work item 15001 to record
the needed work to provide accessibility at the door.
Work Item 02004--Fence, All, Remove/Replace or Install New
Definition: Remove and replace existing fencing (figure 8) and
gates (figure 9).
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.
Unit of Measure: linear feet (LF) of fence.
Measure to the nearest foot the linear feet of the section
of fence that needs to be replaced.
Considerations:
Includes replacing worn-out fences of all standard quality
types (worm, picket, chain link, barbed wire, etc.) regardless
of height or material, including gates.
Does not include premium quality fencing, such as
replicating an elaborate historic pattern or extensive use of
exotic hardwoods. If such work is necessary, it is a custom
item.
Does not include fence repair or routine maintenance, such
as tightening wires, staining, or replacing a couple of
pickets.

Photo of a man standing beside a partly opened gate in a tall
chain-link fence with three strands of barbed wire on top. A
chain and padlock hang from the fence next to the gate latch.
The fence separates a parking lot from a wareyard.
This gate may still be fine for use in a low-security area,
even though the wire panel is warped. If the gate is in an area
with high-security needs, it should be replaced.
Work Item 02005--Electric, Outdoor Pole Lights, Remove/Replace or
Install New
Definition: Remove and replace an outdoor light fixture, complete
with supporting pole or bollard (figure 10).
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.
Unit of Measure: each (EA).
Considerations:
Includes replacing security or parking lot site light
fixtures. Does not include replacing landscape lights, wall
packs, or other less expensive outdoor lights, which are
included in work item 13004.
Includes turning the branch circuit off, positioning the
truck, raising and lowering the boom bucket, removing and
installing the pole and 400 W HPS fixture with lamp and
ballast, testing the pole-mounted fixture, and turning the
branch circuit back on.
Consider relamping costs (labor, equipment, and frequency of
bulb replacement) when choosing new site lights. Relamping site
lights is an operations expense.
Before recording this item in the NRM Infra database, check
to ensure that the Forest Service owns the light(s). Many
utility companies retain ownership of site lights and charge
monthly rent for them. If a utility company owns the light,
have them replace it.
Figure 10

Photo of a cobra head yard light atop a wood pole behind a
brick Forest Service office. The light illuminates a parking
lot.
This parking lot light pole has a distinct lean and minor rot
at the base. The light fixture lens is cracked. The fixture and
pole should be replaced.
Work Item 03001--Concrete Slab or Stem Wall, Minor Repair, Spalls &
Cracks
Definition: Repair concrete stem walls, retaining walls (figure
11), slabs (figure 12), etc.
Typical Life Cycle: 15 years.
Concrete slabs and stem walls last indefinitely unless
adversely affected by soil movement, overloading, or poor
initial construction (inadequate base, poor-quality concrete,
overworked finish, inadequate control joints, etc.). Typical
``wearing-out'' life cycles don't usually drive the need to
repair concrete on buildings.
Unit of Measure: square feet (SF).
Calculate the square feet of the concrete slab or wall that
needs work.
Considerations:
Includes extensive nonstructural repairs or sealing cracks
and spalls on formed concrete and concrete masonry units that
are part of a building, including entry sidewalks, ramps, and
cracked slabs in open buildings, such as carports or picnic
shelters.
Does not include major overlay, repair, or replacement
because of failure of the wall or slab. Does not include stone
or brick masonry work. Use a custom item for such work.
Figure 11
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a thick concrete wall with a stone cap that
separates a grass lawn from an outdoor stairway.
This wall remains sturdy, but the surface layer of the
concrete is peeling off. The surface layer should be removed
and refinished.
Figure 12

entrance to a building.
This concrete slab is cracked and is spalled at the edge of
the control joint. The deficiencies should be repaired.
Work Item 04001--Basic Roof, Fiberglass Shingles, Removal/Replacement
Definition: Remove and replace standard-quality, moderate-cost
roofing (figures 13 and 14).
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.
Unit of Measure: square (SQ) of roofing.
A square of roofing covers about 100 square feet.
Calculate the square feet of roof on the slope and divide by
100; round up to the nearest square.
Considerations:
Includes standard-cost asphalt or fiberglass shingles (30
year shingle or less); V-crimp metal roofing; delta-rib,
exposed-fastener metal roofing; asphalt-roll roofing; or other
moderate-cost roof materials that typically have about a 20
year life cycle.
Includes setting up, securing, and taking down the ladder;
removing existing roofing; removing damaged metal flashing;
installing 15 pound roofing felt; installing new aluminum
flashing; installing roofing; and cleaning up.
Does not include repair work; fixing isolated leaks is
operations or minor maintenance work that needs to be completed
as soon as possible.
Does not include replacing sheathing or vents, other than
integral ridge vents.
Figure 13
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a small, wood-sided Forest Service ``gas house''
with a wood-shingle roof that is about half covered with a
thick growth of moss.
Timely operations and maintenance work, especially moss and
debris removal, could have extended the life of this roof. The
roofing has deteriorated to the point that it should be
replaced.
Figure 14
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Detail photo of an asphalt-shingle roof on a Forest Service
warehouse building.
This roof has many patches of missing shingles and the
remaining shingles are in poor condition. The roof probably
leaks in several places. The shingles should be replaced.
Work Item 04002--Premium Roof, Metal/Membrane/Shakes, Removal and
Replacement
Definition: Remove and replace premium-quality roofing (figures 15
and 16).
Typical Life Cycle: membrane--20 years; wood, tile, or
architectural-grade shingles--30 years; standing-seam metal--50 years.
Unit of Measure: square (SQ) of roofing.
A square of roofing covers about 100 square feet.
Calculate the square feet of roof on the slope and divide by
100; round up to the nearest square.
Considerations:
Includes replacing wood shakes or shingles; tile roofing;
standing-seam metal roofing; slate-, shingle-, or tile-
patterned metal roofing; single-ply membrane roofing;
architectural-grade composition shingles; and other premium-
quality roofing.
Includes setting up, securing, and taking down the ladder;
removing existing roofing; removing flashing metal; installing
new flashing; installing a new roof system, including felt or
an underlayer; and cleaning up.
Because removing and reinstalling rooftop equipment, such as
condensing units, is often required, a crane might be needed to
remove and reinstall equipment. The cost of this work is
reflected in this standard work item.
Does not include replacing nonfunctioning or inadequate
roof-mounted equipment or vents. Use a custom item for such
work if the work is a major expense.
Does not include repair work; fixing isolated leaks is
operations or minor maintenance work that needs to be completed
as soon as possible.
Figure 15
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Detail photo of an asphalt-shingle roof on a Forest Service
warehouse building.
This roof membrane has been patched so many times that it
should be replaced the next time it springs a leak.
Figure 16
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Detail photo of a standing-seam metal roof on a partially
earth-sheltered wood-sided Forest Service building.
This standing-seam roofing is rusting and has come apart in
several places, including at one seam that has been ``fixed''
with caulking. The roofing should be replaced.
Work Item 04003--Skylight, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace a typical, unvented, non-opening
skylight (figure 17).
Typical Life Cycle: 30 years.
Unit of Measure: each (EA).
Considerations:
Includes removing and replacing bubble-type or similar
skylights that are broken, brittle, or no longer transmit
daylight.
Includes setting up and securing the scaffold, removing the
skylight, removing flashing, installing new flashing,
installing the new skylight, and removing scaffold.
Skylight leaks usually come from worn-out or improperly
installed flashing. They may leak through the frame if the
frame has separated. Skylights seldom leak through the glass or
plastic unless a crack or break is visible.
Do not reuse the existing flashing.
It may be necessary to replace some of the roofing
immediately surrounding the skylight to properly install new
flashing; such work is included in this item.
Figure 17
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Detail photo of a rectangular domed skylight set in a sloped
composition-shingle roof on a wood-sided Forest Service
restroom building.
This building has typical bubble-type skylights. This
skylight probably leaks during windblown, heavy rain because of
the separated flashing at the lower end. Carefully evaluate
whether to replace the skylight or just repair the flashing and
roofing.
Work Item 04004--Gutters/Downspouts, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace downspouts (figure 18) and gutters
(figure 19).
Typical Life Cycle: 15 years.
Unit of Measure: linear feet (LF).
Measure the length of both gutters and downspouts, including
downspout returns, and add all segments for total linear feet.
Considerations:
Unless downspouts are directly piped into an underground
stormwater system, include minimum 3 downspout returns to
carry water away from the building (even if the existing
downspouts don't have returns).
Figure 18
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Detail photo of the bottom of a square metal downspout with
peeling paint. A compressed section is directly above ground
level. It is visibly plugged with pine needles.
This downspout is crushed and plugged and should be replaced.
Figure 19
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Detail photo of a section of collapsed gutter above the front
door of a wood-sided Forest Service residence. The back of the
gutter remains securely screwed to the fascia, but the outside
wall of the gutter has been bent down so that it is nearly
perpendicular to the ground, and the end seam has burst.
An ice dam overloaded this gutter. The outside edge of the
gutter is detached from the clip supports and is bent out and
down. The end seams have burst. This gutter should be replaced.
Work Item 05001--Steps, Exterior, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace exterior steps made from concrete
(figure 20), wood, or other materials.
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.
Unit of Measure: step, each (STEP, EA).
Count the stair risers to determine the number of steps. For
example, the photo shows three risers, for a count of ``3 EA.''
Considerations:
Includes replacing exterior steps from 2 to 12 high that
are deteriorated or don't meet code requirements for existing
buildings.
Does not include tread resurfacing, painting, etc., which
are operations or minor maintenance expenses.
Does not include replacing railings. Use work item 05003 for
railings.
Does not include replacing the porch, deck, or stoop. Use
work item 05002 for a wood deck or porch or a custom item for a
concrete porch or stoop.
Figure 20
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a concrete porch and two concrete steps. Corners of
two steps have broken off, the front edge of the steps have
become rounded because of deterioration, and the surface of
both treads and parts of the risers has spalled off, revealing
the aggregate.
These deteriorated concrete steps are a tripping hazard and
should be replaced.
Work Item 05002--Wood Decks, Removal/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace a deteriorated wood (figure 21) or
plastic composite deck or porch.
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.
If the ultraviolet-resistant finish on wood decks is
reapplied as needed, the boards should last about 20 years. If
not, they may last no more than 10 to 15 years.
Unit of Measure: square feet (SF).
Calculate the total square feet of deck that needs to be
replaced.
Considerations:
Includes replacing wood decking, stringers, the
substructure, and the foundation.
Does not include railings. Use work item 05003 for railings.
Does not include washing, sealing, or waterproofing, which
are operations or minor maintenance expenses.
Figure 21
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
View of a partly snow-covered porch with wood board decking
on a concrete foundation, with two concrete steps. Two gaps are
visible where deck boards are missing.
The decking on this porch is badly deteriorated. Most of the
boards are buckled and several are missing. The decking should
be replaced. The joists supporting the deck are probably also
rotten and should be replaced.
Work Item 05003--Railing, Porch & Deck, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace standard-quality exterior guardrail
(figures 22 and 23) and handrail around porches and decks and along
steps and ramps.
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.
Unit of Measure: linear feet (LF).
Measure the total length in feet of railing to be replaced.
Considerations:

deteriorated or don't meet code requirements for the intended
use of the structure.
Includes all usual materials, including dimensioned lumber,
plastic composites, and metal.
Includes replacing a complete railing system 36" to 42"
high, including guardrails and the required scaffolding to
accomplish the task.
Figure 22
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a wood-framed guardrail with woven wire panels. The
top rail is missing above four of the panels.
This guardrail is in worse condition than is evident in a
photo of this size. Aside from the missing boards, many of the
bottom rails and posts are not attached to the structure, many
of the boards are rotted nearly through, fruiting fungi are
growing on many of the boards and posts, and some of the wire
panels are held in place with zip ties. The guardrail needs to
be completely replaced.

Detail photo of part of the middle rail of an observation
deck guardrail. Rot is visible on a 2 long section of the top
of the rail. Part of the rotten wood has fallen off,
This guardrail board on an overlook tower is rotten. If it's
the only rotten board, replacement is considered operations
work that should be completed as soon as possible. If most of
the boards are rotten, the entire guardrail should be recorded
under item 05003 and replaced.
Work Item 06001--Siding, All Types, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace siding (figures 24 and 25).
Typical Life Cycle: 25 years.
Unit of Measure: 100 square feet (CSF).
Calculate the square feet of all siding areas to be
replaced, then divide by 100.
Do not deduct for door and window openings.
Considerations:
Includes removing all types of siding (cement board, wood,
EIFS, plywood, aluminum, vinyl, hardboard, etc.) and replacing
it with the Forest Service standard: fiber cement board or
similar. Includes eaves, trim, fascia, and proper flashing
around windows and doors.
Includes setting up, securing, and taking down the ladder.
Includes painting the new siding.

This shingle siding is worse in some places than in others,
but all the siding is weather damaged and brittle and should be
replaced.
Work Item 06002--Door, Exterior, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace an exterior pedestrian door (figures
26 and 27).
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.
Unit of Measure: each (EA).
``Each'' means each door. Double doors are counted as 2 EA.
An entry with both a door and a screen door is counted as 2 EA
if both need to be replaced.
Considerations:
Includes replacing pedestrian doors up to 4 wide and 8
tall (any material-wood, aluminum, steel, etc.), insulated
vision pane glass (if any), doorframes, closers, and all
commercial hardware and locksets.
Does not include metal-framed glass storefront-type door
surrounds, only the door. Use item 07006 for windows not
included within doors.
Does not include custom replication of fancy historic door
styles. Use a custom item for such work.
Figure 26
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a small storage building with a badly deteriorated
Craftsman style door. Some siding boards are cracked or broken.
The broken-out glass could be replaced, but the delaminating
panels on this door can't be repaired without expert
restoration skills. Preservation requirements determine whether
this historic building's door should be replaced in kind or
restored.
Figure 27
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a deteriorated door in an exterior wall. On the
bottom quarter of the door, the surface layers are peeling off
the pressed wood core and some of the surface layer is missing.
The bottom left side of the door frame trim is rotted and
cracked.
This door looks like an interior door that was mistakenly
installed on an exterior wall. It is badly deteriorated and
should be replaced with an exterior door.
Work Item 06003--Door, Garage, Overhead Door
Definition: Remove and replace overhead doors (figures 28 and 29).
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.
Unit of Measure: each (EA).
Considerations:
Includes removing and disposing of doors up to 16 wide and
9 high that are broken, rotten, or nonfunctional, including
old swinging or sliding doors that need to be replaced with
modern overhead doors.
Includes all door materials (wood, steel, fiberglass, etc.)
along with any vision panes, rollers, springs, and hardware.
Does not include replacing swinging or sliding historic
garage or warehouse doors in kind. Use a custom item to replace
historic doors in kind.
Figure 28

Photo of part of a warehouse and loading dock, centered on a
large four-panel overhead door. An irregularly shaped scrape
that is about 6 long and 1 high is evident on the bottom
panel of the door.
This overhead warehouse door is damaged. Because several
layers of plywood were peeled off the panel, the strength of
the door is compromised. The door should be replaced.
Figure 29
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of the end of a garage with a bent and bowed overhead
garage door. The four-panel door has windows all across the
width of the second panel from the top.
This residential garage door is warped and does not open
properly. The door should be replaced.
Work Item 06004--Painting, Exterior, Includes Prep, Prime and Paint
Definition: Repaint the exterior of a building, including
preparation and prime coat (figures 30 and 31).
Typical Life Cycle: 5 years.
Typical life cycle is for paint on wood siding and trim.
Some other finishes, such as paint on cement composite siding
or semitransparent stain on wood siding, may last longer.
Unit of Measure: square feet (SF).
Calculate the gross square feet of the surface area to be
painted. Do not deduct for openings, such as doors and windows.
Considerations:
Includes surface preparation, caulking (if needed), a full or spot
prime coat (as needed), and painting or staining of all exterior
surfaces, including trim, with latex paint or water-based stain.
Use this item regardless of how many coats of paint are
actually needed, the type of paint (oil base, latex, stain,
etc.), or the type of siding being painted.
Does not include lead paint removal. Use work item 16001 for
removing lead paint.
Figure 30
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a building with wood Dutch-lap siding. The building
has a partial second floor under the roof. The building has two
doors, five windows, and a brick chimney 1extending above the
wood-shingle roof.
Although the paint is peeling badly, the wood siding of this
historic building is in decent condition. New paint will keep
the siding serviceable. Because it's a historic building, old
layers of paint may contain lead, requiring special preparation
(see work item 16001). Follow the building preservation plan
and use historic colors when repainting.
Figure 31
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Detail photo of part of an outside building wall and a wood-
framed, double-hung window. There is little stain left on the
siding and some portions have darkened. Nearly all the paint on
the window frame is peeling.
The T1-11 siding should be cleaned and restained with a
semitransparent penetrating stain. Loose paint should be
scraped or sanded from the window frame and trim before they
are primed and repainted.
Work Item 07001--Doors, Interior, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace an interior door (figure 32).
Typical Life Cycle: 30 years.
Unit of Measure: each (EA).

door closers (if any); installing new doorframes, hinges,
vision panes (if any), and doors; and replacing or reinstalling
the door casing, closers, and latches.
Does not include luxury-grade doors or custom replication of
fancy historic door styles. Use a custom item for such work.
Figure 32
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a wood-faced, flat-slab interior door and frame. The
face veneer is pulling away from the door on both sides.
This interior door is delaminated at the top and should be
replaced. Although only the door should be replaced (not the
frame or hardware), use item 07001 and its standard cost. To
improve accessibility, the knob should be replaced with a
lever-type handle.
Work Item 07002--Toilet Partitions, Per Stall, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace a toilet partition (figure 33) or
urinal screen (figure 34).
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.
Partitions often need to be replaced because of vandalism or
abuse rather than for exceeding their expected life.
Unit of Measure: each (EA).
Count each complete stall or each urinal screen as 1 EA.
Considerations:
Includes removing and replacing all types and sizes of
partitions and doors, all types of hardware and mounting
systems, and cleaning up.
Replacement partitions should be the Forest Service
standard-solid phenolic resin. Because of durability and
graffiti concerns, do not install wood or painted metal
partitions in locations used by the public.
Figure 33
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of part of four stalls in a restroom. The door of one
stall has been replaced with an unpainted piece of plywood,
fastened to the stall frame with heavy-duty hinges that don't
match the hinges on the rest of the stall doors.
Although the obvious problem is the mismatched plywood stall
door, all these partitions and doors are constructed of aging
plastic laminated to pressed board. The edges of the partitions
and doors are chipped, some are delaminating in places, and
some are warped. The doors and partitions should be replaced.
Figure 34
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a urinal and adjacent painted metal privacy screen.
The screen has extensive rust, especially on the portion that
is beside the urinal catch basin.
This urinal screen began to rust after the painted finish
became scratched and chipped. The screen should be replaced.
Work Item 07003--Drywall, Install & Taped, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace gypsum wallboard (figures 35 and
36).
Typical Life Cycle: 75 years.
Replacement is usually needed because of water damage,
vandalism, or abuse and is not typically related to the
expected life of the product.
Unit of Measure: square feet (SF).
Measure the replacement area to the center of the next nearest
support (stud, joist, etc.), because replacement material must be
fastened to a support. Calculate the total square feet to be replaced.
Considerations:
Includes taping and texturing \1/2\" or \5/8\" thick type X
gypsum wallboard (also called drywall, plasterboard, or
Sheetrock).
Includes removing other wall surfacing, such as plywood or
pressed-board paneling, and replacing it with gypsum wallboard.
Does not include painting. Use work item 09001 for painting.
Does not include in-kind replacement of plaster, premium
wood paneling, or other high-end wall surfaces. Use a custom
item for such work.
Figure 35
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Detail photo of part of a ceiling. Water drops cling to the
painted surface in three large areas. Water coming through the
ceiling caused the paint on one area to bubble down from the
ceiling.
Water damage from a leaking roof ruined this gypsum wallboard
ceiling. The paint is probably the only thing keeping the
ceiling in place, because exposure to water degrades the
structural integrity of ordinary gypsum wallboard. After the
roof is repaired, the gypsum wallboard ceiling should be
replaced. See item 16002--Environmental Mitigation, if there is
mold.
Figure 36
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Detail photo of part of a floor and wall next to an open
door. The bottom of the wall is fluted because of swelling and
delamination of the paper surface layer of the gypsum wallboard
caused by water.
Water damage from a burst pipe during the off-season caused a
flood in this crew-quarters building that damaged the bottom of
all the kitchen walls. The damaged gypsum wallboard should be
replaced.
Work Item 07004--Cabinets, Kitchen, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace built-in cabinetry and countertops
(figure 37).
Typical Life Cycle: 30 years.
Unit of Measure: linear feet (LF).
Measure linear feet along the wall from one end of the
cabinets to the other end.
All cabinets along the same wall are measured together for
this work item. The cost per linear foot includes base cabinets
and wall cabinets or either of these components alone. For
example, if only upper cabinets will be replaced, enter the
total length of the upper cabinets under this work item. Do not
reduce the length entered because the base cabinets will not be
replaced.
Considerations:
Includes removing and replacing all types of worn-out,
broken, or nonfunctioning cabinets, except laboratory cabinets,
in all locations. Use item 07005 for laboratory cabinets.
Includes countertops, base cabinets, wall cabinets, hinges,
and pulls.
Does not include cabinet repair or refinishing, which could
be operations or minor maintenance work or a custom work item
if the expense is significant.
Figure 37
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
View of a kitchen wall with old wooden cabinets and a wide,
sliding, wood-framed window above the sink. The paint has come
off the cabinet drawers and doors in several places.
Although the doors are crooked and the drawers don't slide
easily, these cabinets are still functional. Because they are
sturdier than most modern cabinets, it may be better to fix
than to replace them, especially if they have historic
significance.
Work Item 07005--Cabinets, Laboratory, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace built-in laboratory cabinetry and
countertops (figures 38 and 39).
Typical Life Cycle: 40 years.
Unit of Measure: linear feet (LF).
Measure linear feet along the wall from one end of the
cabinets to the other end.
All cabinets along the same wall are measured together for
this work item. The cost per linear foot includes base cabinets
and wall cabinets or either of these components alone. For
example, if only base cabinets will be replaced, enter the
total length of the base cabinets under this work item. Do not
reduce the length entered because wall-hung upper cabinets are
not needed.
Considerations:
Includes removing and replacing worn-out, broken, or
nonfunctioning chemical-resistant countertops, base cabinets,
and wall cabinets.
Does not include cabinet repair or refinishing, which could
be operations or minor maintenance work, or a custom item if
the expense is significant.

Photo of a clear-finish wood cabinet supporting a lab sink
and counter. One cabinet door has a large horizontal scratch.
The cabinet finish is stained and deteriorating in a few
places.
This wooden lab cabinet and countertop look as though they
are in poor condition. However, a thorough cleaning and
refinishing will probably restore them. They still function
well.
Work Item 07006--Window, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace a window (figure 40).
Typical Life Cycle: 30 years.
Unit of Measure: each (EA).
Count each window unit as 1 EA. Window units are separated
by a section of wall or by a vertical support mullion, as shown
in figure 41. The paired components of sliding or double-hung
windows are counted as one window unit.
Considerations:
Includes removing and replacing existing windows with new
windows that meet the Forest Service standard (good quality,
thermally efficient). Includes all materials, equipment, and
scaffolding required to complete the work, including replacing
or repairing trim.
Includes replacing windows that should be tempered but often
aren't, such as windows near doors and stairways or within 18"
of the floor.
Includes replacing single-pane windows with new windows to
increase energy efficiency.
Does not include storefront windows (large expanses of glass
typically surrounding an entry door), which are custom work.
Does not include window repair (an operations or maintenance
expense) or rebuilding historic windows (a custom item).
Caution: for buildings that are eligible for or listed on
the National Register of Historic Places, it is often better to
rebuild and/or add storm windows rather than replacing original
windows. Such work is a custom item.

Detail photo of a double kitchen sink with dirty dishes
stacked in one bowl. A sign posted on the wall behind the sink
reads: ``Notice: Non-potable water. Not for drinking or
cleaning.['']
Although it has two bowls, this double kitchen sink would
count as ``1 each.'' A larger problem needs to be addressed,
however: the water is apparently nonpotable and not suitable
for washing the dishes that are stacked in the sink. To prevent
illness, water to the sink should be shut off until the water
system is restored to potability.
Work Item 10003--Tub/Shower Complete, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace a bathtub or shower, including
spout, faucet(s), and showerhead (figure 54).

access.
Figure 57
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a sink faucet with an eyewash station operated using
a squeeze lever and automatic flip-up spout covers. The eyewash
station has a retractable extension hose so it can be pulled
out and over the sink for use. The eyewash station is very
dirty and greasy, as are the sink, counter, and sink faucet.
This eyewash station is too dirty to ensure a rinse with
uncontaminated water. If a thorough cleaning isn't sufficient
to return it to a sanitary condition, it should be replaced.
Figure 58
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a dirty, stained sink with a very old eyewash
station mounted on the end of a chrome sink faucet with an
``X''-type handle. The eyewash spouts look like sink faucet
aerators and have no protective covers. Beside the eye wash is
a rough-plumbed pipe extending from the wall with a wheel-type
handle and an elbow to a downturned discharge opening that
serves as the sink faucet.
The lack of protective covers and an easy-to-operate
activator make this eyewash station unsuitable for use. It
clearly should be replaced.

Photo of two roughly cube-shaped heat pumps mounted or,
concrete pads outside a vinyl-sided Forest Service office with
a stone-faced base. The concrete pads have settled and aren't
level. The heat pumps have grills on the front and sides.
These air-source heat pumps would probably operate acceptably
if they were sitting on level pads. The heat pumps are old and
not very efficient, however, so they probably should be
replaced.

personal property.
Does not include monthly checks on compressors required by
OSHA, which is operations work.
Figure 74
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a floor-mounted permanently wired and piped air
compressor inside a screened alcove.
This compressor in a laboratory building is typical of
permanently mounted compressors that serve pressure air lines.
It operates well and will probably continue to do so for many
more years.
Figure 75
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a large air-compressor tank with two motors on top
that have separate switches. Several notes and tags with
operating instructions are attached to the tank and wiring
conduit.
This permanently mounted compressor is part of an HVAC
system. Although it's not new, it has been well maintained and
works well.
Work Item 12002--Elevator, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace an elevator that serves up to three
stories (figures 76 and 77).
Typical Life Cycle: 50 years.
Unit of Measure: each (EA).
Considerations:
Includes removing and replacing inoperative or unsafe
elevators or lifts serving two or three stories, or installing
a new elevator that is needed to provide accessibility.
Does not include elevators for high-rise buildings or other
long vertical distances. For instance, replacing the elevator
that descends 216 into Blanchard Springs Caverns on the Ozark
National Forest would be a custom item.
Does not include annual state inspections, repairing leaks
in oil reservoirs and piping, or repairing faulty emergency
phones, all of which are operations work.
Figure 76
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of an elevator door and frame with a bronze metallic
finish. A single elevator call button is on the wall beside the
frame. The numeral 2 is attached to the elevator door and
another numeral 2 is attached to the doorframe.
This elevator was installed more than 30 years ago. Although
the finish on the door and trim is a little worn, it has many
years of service left if it is properly maintained.
Figure 77
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of part of a two-story lobby with a balcony guarded by
an open metal mesh rail at the second floor. Elevator doors are
on both the lobby and balcony levels.
This elevator was installed when the building was constructed
in 2002. It serves two floors and is a typical size for a
Forest Service elevator. It has had a few operational problems
that have been corrected promptly. It is serviced regularly and
should continue to work well for a long time.
Work Item 12003--Laboratory Fume Hood/Exhaust Hood, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace an enclosed laboratory fume hood
(figure 78).
Typical Life Cycle: 30 years.
Unit of Measure: each (EA).

Includes removing and replacing worn-out or inoperative
laboratory-type fume hoods, fume hoods used for painting small
items, and other similar enclosed or semi-enclosed countertop
exhaust hoods.
Includes replacement because of inoperative sashes, a
compromised enclosure, or because the system is not energy
efficient.
Does not include HVAC exhaust equipment or other exhaust
fans not associated with an exhaust hood. Bathroom fans;
exhaust fans in shop buildings; residential kitchen hoods; and
fans in attics, warehouses, and garages are replaced as
maintenance work. These fans have a life expectancy of about 10
years.
Does not include the annual inspection of fan face velocity
and overall function required by OSHA, which is operations
work.
Does not include ductwork. Cleaning, repairing or replacing
ducts, duct insulation, duct cement, and duct taping or sealing
are usually operations work, but may be a custom item if the
work is extensive.
Figure 78
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a 6 wide fume-hood cabinet with a glass door that
is raised about halfway. The hood enclosure rests on a counter
over a wood cabinet. The fan and bottom of the vent duct are on
top of the hood cabinet.
This fume hood has operated satisfactorily since 1961. It
doesn't have modern features, but still works because it is
well maintained. The fan motor is probably inefficient,
however. Replacing the fan is ordinary maintenance work.
Work Item 13001--Main Service Switchgear, <1,200 Amps, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace the main switchgear at an electric
service entrance (figures 79 and 80).
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.

breakers (example: a single circuit breaker in a cabinet) or
shutoff switches that serve a single piece of equipment and are
located within sight of the equipment that they serve.
Figure 81
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of two large, exposed shutoff switches and two
emergency transfer switches in cabinets mounted on a wall.
Smaller unlabeled shutoff switches and flip switches are
mounted below each elevator switch.
Shutoff switches are sometimes grouped near the equipment
they serve. These heavy-duty switches are for a pair of
elevators. The switches are in excellent condition.
Figure 82
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a small shutoff switch mounted on a wall below a
panel box. The wire from the shutoff to the circuit-breaker box
and to the compressor is in flexible conduit. The conduit from
the shutoff to the compressor runs across a large round of wood
with an anvil attached to it. The compressor hose is looped
over a hose rack mounted on the wall behindthe conduit and
anvil block.
The wiring from the disconnect switch to the compressor in
this old shop should not be suspended across the anvil block.
The disconnect switch should be replaced with a switch closer
to the compressor, and the wiring from the panel to the switch
should be encased in rigid conduit secured to the wall.
Work Item 13003--Electrical Panel, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace an electrical panel (figures 83 and
84).
Typical Life Cycle: 30 years.
Unit of Measure: each (EA).
Considerations:
Includes removing and replacing an electric load center,
lighting, or equipment panel; single- or three-phase; up to 42
spaces and 400 amp rating.
Includes replacement because of rust and corrosion, growth
of the load being served, obsolescence, or possibly because of
hot spots revealed by thermography.
Does not include fitting knockouts with appropriate covers,
labeling circuits, or the checking and retightening of
electrical connections every few years by a licensed
electrician, which are operations or minor maintenance work.
Figure 83
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a 36-space panel box with the door open. Some of the
circuit numbers are written beside the breakers in felt pen,
some correct circuit numbers are on the breaker switches, some
wrong circuit numbers are on the breaker switches, and some
breakers are not numbered. Duct tape covers six circuit-breaker
switches. Three pieces of the tape are labeled ``off'' and
three are labeled ``leave on.'' Duct tape also covers an empty
slot. A note is taped to the inside of the door that says
``Audio/Video Equipment. On in morning. Off in evening.''
This old electrical panel is a bit rusty. Duct tape was used
as an inappropriate substitute for a knockout cover and to
indicate which circuits should remain on or off at all times.
The circuitry appears to have been modified many times, which
is a problem if the work was not performed according to code
requirements. This panel should be replaced.
Figure 84
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a 125 amp, 42 space panel box with the door open.
All circuit breakers are properly numbered.
The electrical panel in this photo is a good example of a
properly wired and well maintained panel, except that labels
for a few of the circuits are missing from the list on the
door.

fixture lenses, or replacing wiring channel covers or impact
guards, which are operations or minor maintenance work.
Figure 85
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a suspended light fixture in an office. The fixture
has two sections, each with two 4 long fluorescent tubes and
metal ``egg crate'' grills.
This typical, old fluorescent office light fixture uses T-12
tube lamps and a magnetic ballast. It is far less energy
efficient than modern fixtures. Although T-12 tubes are still
available, this fixture should be replaced in the near future.
Figure 86
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of an old storage shed with numerous buckets, a barrel,
tires, and miscellaneous equipment stacked around it. The light
fixture is on the gable end between the peak of the roof and a
screened vent. A sign on the shed door reads: ``Danger
Flammable.''
This exterior light fixture is simply a ceramic bulb socket
mounted under a handmade steel hood. It is unsafe and should be
replaced.
Work Item 13005--Emergency Light Fixture, Remove/Replace
Definition: Remove and replace an emergency light fixture (figure
87) or exit light (figure 88).
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.
Unit of Measure: each (EA).
Considerations:
Includes removing and replacing obsolete or inoperative
emergency light fixtures and exit signs with fluorescent or LED
fixtures or signs, or photoluminescent signs.
Photoluminescent signs must be lit continually by an outside
light source to work properly when the power goes out. Work
includes adding such a light source.
Includes replacing fixtures or signs to improve energy
efficiency.
Figure 87
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a commercial emergency light two small round
floodlights mounted on top of a rectangular box that holds the
transfer switches and battery. In the lower left corner of the
box are a button to push to test operation on battery and an
indicator light showing current power source.
Although this emergency light was only 10 years old, it
failed yearly operational testing and was repaired three times
before the facilities manager replaced it.
Figure 88
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of a photoluminescent ``EXIT'' sign illuminated by a
small strip fight mounted above the sign.
The fluorescent exit signs with battery backup at this
building continually failed yearly operating tests and required
repair. Finally, the facilities manager purchased
photoluminescent signs and lit them with inexpensive LED strip
lights so that the signs would always be ``charged'' should the
power go out.
Work Item 13006--Fire Alarm and/or Security System, Install
Definition: Remove and replace a fire alarm system (figure 89) or
security system.
Typical Life Cycle: 20 years.

Considerations:
Includes removing and replacing a complete inoperative or
obsolete fire alarm or security system, including control
panels, fire alarms, hard-wired smoke detectors, carbon
monoxide detectors, etc.
Includes installing a system when none exists. A change in
occupancy classification may make adding a system necessary.
For instance, converting a former office at a work center to
crew quarters may necessitate installing fire alarms, smoke
detectors, and carbon monoxide detectors.
Does not include testing and replacing inoperable individual
components of a system (figure 90), which are operations
expenses and should be completed immediately.
Combination fire alarm/intruder alarm systems are common in
larger buildings.
Figure 89
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Photo of an old fire alarm manual pull switch and horn
mounted on a concrete block wall. The wiring for the horn and

(and very expensive) item.
Does not include the yearly preopening inspection of
lightning protection systems for lookout towers, which is an
operations cost.
Does not include expert inspection every 5 years, per NFPA
780 B.5. Major work items identified during the expert
inspection need to be added to the NRM Infra database. Minor
work items should be accomplished using operations or
maintenance funds.
Figure 91

Detail photo of a solid guardrail high above the ground. A
small, single-wire antenna, a very short air terminal (vertical
copper rod), and the lower portion of a galvanized pipe mast
for a larger antenna are all mounted on it in close proximity
on the rail. An assortment of insulated wires, a braided steel
cable, and a braided, patinated copper cable--all in various
stages of deterioration--run horizontally along the rail and
are attached to it in a few places.
This lightning protection system includes a clamp that
doesn't grab all the strands, an air terminal that is far from
being the tallest conductor on the roof, and many unbonded
metal items. The system should be given a major overhaul or
should be replaced.
Figure 92

Purpose of National Random Sample
The national random sample for roads is generated solely for:
1.
External reporting of:
a.
Critical and non-critical deferred maintenance needs for
passenger
car roads in FS financial statement
b.
Deferred Maintenance backlog to Congress, and
c.
Condition class of transportation system (Performance
Measures--not yet
implemented)
The following guidelines are applicable only for collecting and
reporting the agency's national deferred maintenance needs.
Thank you to Catherine Taylor and Christina Foreman of the
Volpe Center for their work on our Deferred Maintenance Method
in accordance with the OIG Audit recommendations and
contributing information incorporated into this document on the
revised sample methodology goals and objectives and their
Tables 1-3.
1. Requirements for Reporting Deferred Maintenance, Annual Maintenance,
and Capital Improvement Needs for Roads
Deferred Maintenance
The agency has moved to a national random sample to report deferred
maintenance for passenger car roads (operational maintenance level 3-
5). See item 2 below. There are no requirements to report deferred
maintenance needs at the Regional or Forest level.
Annual Maintenance
There are no national requirements to report annual maintenance
needs. Collection of annual maintenance needs, costs, and
accomplishments for the random sample is not required for agency
reporting purposes.
Reporting annual maintenance accomplishments on all system roads,
regardless of the random sample is required. The Road Maintenance
Planning tool is now available in NRM to support annual maintenance
planning, cost estimating, and accomplishment reporting. The tool can
be useful in prioritizing annual maintenance needs within a given
budget to produce annual maintenance plans. For more information on the
Road Maintenance Planning tool, see the Travel Routes Road User Board
webpage (https://usdagcc.sharepoint.com/sites/fs-wo-eng/SitePages/
RUB.aspx)[.]
Capital Improvements
There are no requirements to report capital improvement needs at
any level.
2. National Random Sample for Roads
Note: Conclusions and extrapolations determined from national
random sample condition survey data for roads are ONLY VALID AT THE
NATIONAL LEVEL.
Limitations of National Random Sample
1.
Deferred maintenance needs determined from the national random
sample are only valid for required reporting at the Forest
Service national level.
2.
Only deferred maintenance needs must be collected for the random
sample. Collection of annual maintenance needs data for the
national random sample is optional. Such data will not be
used at the national level but may be useful at the forest
level for planning purposes
3.
All deferred maintenance summaries or extrapolations resulting
from the data collected on the random sample are only valid
in the context of nationally averaged unit costs.
4.
The data gathered through this effort has been analyzed and
determine to be statistically invalid for use below the
national level reporting.
Business Process for Running the National Random Sample
There are four key considerations to address within the Random
Sample process:
1.
The total sample size (i.e., the total number of ML3-ML5 road
fragments to pull from the national database); and
2.
All the fragments in the new subset database have an equal
probability of being selected regardless of whether a
segment is on the same road has already been selected, and
3.
Roads sampled in prior years are available for inclusion in the
current sample, and
4.
The method for ensuring randomness.
Each of the four steps is summarized in the following sections.
Goals and Objectives
Because the goal is to estimate deferred maintenance cost per mile,
the statistic of interest is a ratio. The sample size calculation for a
ratio estimator is more intricate than the basic estimator because its
calculation takes into account variations in both the deferred
maintenance costs and segment lengths.
The original sampling method relied on the ROADCORE II database
which contains road segments of varying lengths that are defined by
natural breakpoints in the road such as county boundaries, bridges,
change in surface types like gravel, pavement, etc. As the result the
length of the segments in the database varied significantly from 0.1
miles to 40 miles. This variation in the underlying population of the
road segment length is a significant contributor to the large sample
size of segments and also increased the total road mileage sampled
since long segments would require the entire length to be analyzed for
deferred maintenance needs.
To keep the sample size and effort reasonable, while addressing OIG
concerns of calculating sample size based on ratio estimators, the
Random Roads sample methodology originally created for 2018 and
continued for use in 2020 creates fragment (previously based upon Road
Core segments) sample sections from the ROADCORE II database
(hereinafter referred to as fragments) of more uniform and shorter
length.
All fragments included need to meet the following criteria:
from ii--Road--Core
where JURISDICTION like `FS%'
and ROUTE--STATUS like `EX%'
and SYSTEM like `NFSR%'
and substr(OPER--MAINT--LEVEL,1,1) in (`3',`4',`5')
and ADMIN_ORG is not Null
The steps involved in this alternative method are:
1.
Create a new subset within the database of road fragments with
more uniform fragment lengths to be used as the sampling
frame for selecting road fragments for analysis of deferred
maintenance needs. The roads in the database are divided
into 1 mile fragments from the beginning mile post (BMP).
Since roads are rarely exact integers in length, the last
fragment of a road may be less than a mile.
2.
Based on the new fragmentation of the road database, the
calculated appropriate sample size to yield a point
estimate of deferred maintenance per mile that has a 90
percent confidence interval that is +/- 15% of the point
estimate incorporates the concept that the statistic of
interest is a ratio (as pointed out by OIG) and is based on
data from 2013, 2014, and 2015.
3.
The sample stratification plan results in a sample that is
representative of the entire FS network.
Total Sample Size
The total target sample size for FY 2020 is 600 road fragments (the
same as for FY 2018). This value represents the estimated required
sample size to obtain an estimate of mean deferred maintenance cost per
mile with a precision of 15% at the 90% confidence level. Note that in
FY 2018, the 600 fragment sample actually yielded a statistically
calculated precision of +/- 12% at the 90% confidence level. The
resulting data showed less variation than presumed in developing the FY
2018 sampling plan. If this FY 2020 effort similarly results in
precision tighter than +/- 15% using a sample size of 600, it may be
possible to reduce the sample size in future years.
Table 1 presents the counts and percentages of fragments in the new
roads database based on a snapshot of the roads database created for
the FY 2018 sample draw. For the purposes of the FY 2020 effort, it is
assumed that the underlying characteristics of the roads database has
not changed substantially since the FY18 effort. In that database snap
shot, 66% of the fragments have uniform lengths of 1 mile while the
remaining 34% of the road fragment population has lengths that vary
(between 0 and less than 1 mile). This also translates into 85% of the
miles from 1 mile fragments and 15% from incomplete fragments (54,913
miles and 10,015 miles).

For the purposes of this analysis we assume a required sample size
that is weighted average of the sample size needed for a ratio
statistic that has a uniform denominator of 1 (that is, a statistic
that is not actually a ratio) and the sample size needed for ratio
statistic that has a denominator that is variable (that is, a statistic
that actually is a ratio).
Previously, the characteristics of deferred maintenance per mile
data from 2013, 2014, and 2015 yielded a sample size of 327 road
segments (non-ratio statistic). Calculations based on the OIG Audit
concerns yielded a required sample size of 1,121 segments (ratio
statistic). Taking the weighted average of two yields a sample size of
approximately 600 fragments based on (0.67
327 + 0.33
1,121 = 589).
Region-Level Sample Size
As with the FY 2018 sample, the total FY 2020 sample is stratified
by region, proportionally with respect to each region's share of newly
created road fragments. The target sample sizes by region are presented
in Table 1, by number of complete 1 mile fragments, the number of
incomplete fragments and the total fragments in the sample:

Table 3 summarizes the proposed stratification plan based on
effective sample size. For example, 118 fragments should be drawn from
Region 1, and 104 should be drawn from the collection of fragments that
are 1 mile in length, and 14 drawn from fragments that are less than 1
mile in length.

Regional distribution of the total sample does not match the
regional distribution of the total ML3-ML5 system mileage.
Randomness
Following are the requirements for ensuring the sample is purely
random. Note that the resulting random sample for FY 2020 is expected
to be substantially different than the random sample selected for FY
2018. Therefore, the analyst responsible for drawing the FY 2020 sample
should compare it to the random sample drawn for FY 2018 and confirm
that few, if any, segments that were drawn in FY 2018 are also drawn
for FY 2020.
1.
Each road fragment has an equal probability of being selected
within a region and road (It is possible to have multiple
fragments in one road.)
2.
The target region-level sample sizes in Table 3 are achieved.
3.
An entire road fragment is selected unless the ML changes or the
route ends.
FY 2018 Random Sample
The National Random Sample of 600 fragments, generated with the
above criteria is available from within NRM by running the roads report
RD--DM01L. These roads must receive a deferred maintenance condition
survey in FY 2020. The data collected from the condition surveys will
be used to determine the Forest Service's agency-wide road deferred
maintenance needs for ML 3-5 roads. The accuracy of the data contained
in the sixteen required fields listed in the Travel Planning Handbook
(FSH 7709.55, Zero Code) must be validated, and corrections made when
errors are discovered.
Users will be able to query live NRM data by security ID to monitor
condition survey accomplishments and check data entry. A Random Sample
List and Accomplishment Report are available for managers on the
Corporate Data Warehouse (CDW), under Deferred Maintenance/Roads, using
a snapshot of data that will be refreshed regularly.
3. Business Rules for Field Surveys
1.
Only Deferred Maintenance needs are required to be collected for
the random sample. Collection of Annual Maintenance needs
is optional.
2.
Deferred maintenance needs should be collected by Priority
(Critical/Non-Critical) and Reason (Health & Safety/
Resource Protection/Forest Mission), according to Deferred
Maintenance Protocols already established.
3.
All condition surveys should be based on operational maintenance
level needs. This change occurred in FY 2007, and was done
to place condition surveys in the context of annual
maintenance planning.
4.
All deferred maintenance needs will be computed using the
National Unit Costs accessed through the Task Tab in NRM or
ERL.
5.
If ERL is not used to conduct the condition survey, a Condition
Survey record must be entered in the Record of Events.
6.
Field surveys for random sample roads shall validate all existing
deferred maintenance work items and/or create new deferred
maintenance work items that reflect current conditions. If
a previous year's work item is no longer valid, it should
be deleted.
7.
Field surveys shall validate and reconcile the data contained in
the sixteen required fields listed in the Travel Planning
Handbook (FSH 7709.55, Zero Code). Make corrections in the
database when errors are found.
8.
Deferred Maintenance data for the random sample will be loaded
into NRM, and quality checked, by the date specified in the
Year-End Schedule.
9.
The Regional Engineer shall assure the quality and completeness
of the data collected for the Random Sample at the end of
each fiscal year. The Forest Staff Officer for Engineering
is responsible for the estimate of Deferred Maintenance
needs and will select individuals to complete condition
surveys based on knowledge, education, and experience.
10.
At a minimum, survey and enter work items for the road fragment
that is included in the random sample list. Surveying and
entering work items for any other portion of the road is
optional. Data on fragments not in the random sample will
not be used at the national level but may be useful at the
forest level for planning purposes.
4. Year-End Schedule and Summarization Processes
Schedule
October 31, 2019-September 29, 2020: Forests and regions enter
deferred maintenance needs and validate data for the random sample in
NRM. Forests and regions use NRM accomplishment and summarization
reports to check NRM data and make appropriate edits before agency
summaries are generated.
September 30: NRM is closed to editing.
The following dates are approximate:
October 2-6: Data Summarization Process is executed by NRM
Programmers. WO Roads Program Manager validates and approves data. (See
Summarization description below.) Once approved, NRM programmers will
finalize agency summaries and formats for formal submittal.
October 6: NRM is open for editing. Records cannot be deleted until
replication with CPAIS resumes. This can take up to 6 weeks.
Summarization Process
The data summarization process occurs after Forests and Regions
have validated their data in NRM and involves calculating total
deferred maintenance needs by Priority (Critical/Non-Critical) and
Reason (Health & Safety/Resource Protection/Forest Mission) for the
Random Sample. The WO Road Program Manager will use the random sample
subtotals, prior year needs reports, and other information to validate
the data for the Random Sample. Once validated, the random sample data
will be used to determine a national average unit cost per mile
extrapolated over the total Operational Maintenance Level 3-5 system to
determine the agency's deferred maintenance needs by priority and
reason.

6. Frequently Asked Questions:
Field Surveys
Q1. What do I do if the selected road does not physically exist?
Do not survey a replacement road.
Document road numbers and explain why they exist in the
inventory.
Forward documentation to the RO User Board Representative.
Correct data in NRM. For example, update the route status
for decommissioned roads.
Q2. What do I do if the selected road does not have any fragments
with FS jurisdiction?
Do not survey a replacement road.
Document road numbers and explain why Jurisdiction is
incorrect in the inventory.
Forward documentation to the RO User Board Representative.
Correct data in NRM. For example, update the road fragments
with incorrect Jurisdiction values equal to FS.
Q3. What do I do if the road selected is not a ML 3-5?
The random sample business process and NRM scripts are designed to
only select ML 3-5 roads. However, there may be situations where data
discrepancies or data edits that occurred after the random sample was
generated resulted on ML 1-2 roads being selected for the random
sample. In such cases:
Do not survey a replacement road.
Document road numbers and explain the maintenance level is
incorrect in the inventory.
Forward documentation to the RO User Board Representative.
Correct data in NRM. For example, update the operational
maintenance level.
Q4. How are these condition surveys related to Real Property Roads
Inventory?
The purpose of the condition surveys is to allow the Forest Service
to estimate its Deferred Maintenance needs on its passenger car road
system. As part of those surveys, units are required to validate the 16
required data fields, and update as needed. The Real Property Roads
Inventory is done to verify the existence of all roads in our
inventory, and to verify some of the data elements. These two efforts
are not related.
Q5. What do I do if the selected road has been changed from ML3 to
ML2?
Do not survey a replacement road.
Document road numbers and explain why they exist in the
inventory.
Forward documentation to the RO User Board Representative.
Correct data in NRM.
Data
Q1. What date fields are populated in NRM from ERL?
A ``Record of Event'' entry is made for a Condition Survey type
Inspection with the date (Inspection Date) and survey party (to
Remarks) from ERL.
For existing tasks:
The YEAR field is left unchanged
the DAY_ID field is updated with the date of the current
field survey
The CREATED_DATE is left unchanged
The MODIFIED_DATE is updated with the date of the upload.
For new tasks:
The YEAR field is populated with the current FY
The DAY_ID field is populated with the date of the current
field survey
The CREATED_DATE is populated with the date of the upload
The MODIFIED_DATE is populated with the date of the upload.
An ``Event'' entry is made in NRM. An Inspection Event Subtype =
CS--Condition Survey is made with the date of the condition survey
recorded in ERL.
Q2. Where is the Deferred Maintenance data collected prior to FY
2006?
Prior to FY06, all tasks (AM, DM, CI) regardless of
completion were archived. Beginning in FY06 and forward, only
completed tasks were archived. This change occurred due to file
size concerns, and accomplishment reporting requirements.
In addition, a snapshot of all tasks that existed at the end
of FY05 is included with the completed tasks on the Archived
Tasks screen.
To date, the Archived Tasks screen (filtered view of the ii
tasks table) contains a mix of completed tasks (AM, DM, CI)
when the YEAR is >= 2006, and all tasks (completed and
uncompleted) when the YEAR equals 2005.
To access road tasks older than 2005, utilize the Archived
Tasks for Roads (II_TASKS_ARCHIVR_ROAD_V) user view or submit a
helpdesk ticket. These tasks are stored in a separate table in
the database.
For condition surveys performed using ERL, the Survey Date
(DAY_ID) field will retain the original survey date, until the
work item is revisited on a subsequent condition survey; at
which time it will be overwritten with the latest survey date.
The work item date history, which records when the work item
was originally identified on a condition survey, is no longer
available. This eliminates the ability to determine how long
some of the maintenance needs have been languishing.
NRM's business rules for how date fields are handled has changed
several times. This has resulted in inconsistencies in date related
data for work tasks. It is difficult to establish any pattern for how
these dates have been handled since condition survey data was collected
in 1999. It is nearly impossible, without a major undertaking, to
utilize archived data older than FY 2006 for any kind of accomplishment
reporting or trend analysis.

Deferred maintenance values for passenger car roads and trails are based
on a statistically significant random sampling of these assets to
generate a national deferred maintenance cost per mile. These national
averages are not statistically valid at a regional or forest level,
but have been applied for estimation purposes. Deferred maintenance
values for high clearance vehicle and basic custodial care (closed)
roads cannot be estimated with a suitable degree of confidence and are
therefore not included.
*Roads and/or Trails may have segments located in multiple states that
may lie outside ofproclaimed unit boundaries.
** Editor's note: the table, as submitted, when referring to the Grand
Mesa, Uncompahgre & Gunnison National Forest shortened ``Uncompahgre

Deferred maintenance values for passenger car roads and trails are based on a statistically significant random
sampling of these assets to generate a national deferred maintenance cost per mile. These national averages
are not statistically valid at a regional or forest level, but have been applied for estimation purposes.
Deferred maintenance values for high clearance vehicle and basic custodial care (closed) roads cannot be
estimated with a suitable degree of confidence and are therefore not included.
* Deferred maintenance totals for trails and road bridges as shown in this table may differ from FY 2018
national totals as this table excludes assets that do not have a value for `Congressional district' assigned
in the system of record.
** Deferred maintenance values for road bridges is estimated based on the proportion of the Congressional
district's deferred maintenance compared to the state total deferred maintenance as of March 26, 2019, as data
for total deferred maintenance values by congressional district are dynamic and no longer available for
September 30, 2018 as of the date of publication of this report.
