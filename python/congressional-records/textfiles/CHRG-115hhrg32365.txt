The Chairman. I now call to order the Committee on House
Administration for today's committee hearing. A quorum is
present, so we may proceed.
The meeting record will remain open for 5 legislative days
so that Members may submit any materials that they wish to be
included herein.
There is one item on our docket today, Committee Resolution
115-9, a resolution to disburse $200,000 from the Committee's
reserve fund to the Foreign Affairs Committee. This
disbursement is in response to a request the Committee received
from the Chairman of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.
The disbursement will provide resources for the operations to
the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission.
I would now like to recognize my colleague and the
Committee's Ranking Member, Mr. Brady, for the purpose of
providing an opening statement.
[The statement of Chairman Harper follows:]
Mr. Brady. Mr. Chairman, I have consulted with the minority
leadership of the Foreign Affairs Committee, and they are
supportive of the request, and so am I. And I urge the
Committee to pass this resolution.
And I yield back the balance of my time.
[The statement of Mr. Brady follows:]
The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Brady.
Does any other Member wish to be recognized for the purpose
of an opening statement?
Seeing none, I move the Committee adopt Committee
Resolution 115-9. The question is on the motion. All those in
favor, signify by saying aye.
Any opposed, nay.
Seeing none, unanimously, in the opinion of the Chair, the
ayes have it, and the motion is agreed to. Without objection,
the motion to reconsider is laid upon the table.
Does any Member wish to submit supplemental or minority
views?
Seeing none, for all the matters considered here today, I
would ask unanimous consent that the staff be authorized to
make technical and conforming changes, if necessary. Without
objection, so ordered.
That concludes today's markup. Without objection, the
markup is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 1:09 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]
