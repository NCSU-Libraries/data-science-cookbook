OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GREGG HARPER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MISSISSIPPI
Mr. Harper. Good afternoon. We are here today to hold a
hearing examining the ongoing GAO audit series of HHS
cybersecurity programs.
Since the Committee submitted its request to GAO in 2013,
GAO has performed three audits of major operating divisions
within HHS. Today's hearing will provide an opportunity for the
subcommittee to learn more about GAO's findings over this
series of audits as well as the steps taken by HHS and its
operating divisions to respond to these findings.
Given that GAO has completed three of these audits, today's
hearing will also provide an opportunity to examine HHS
cybersecurity roles and responsibilities. These GAO audits
provide a valuable opportunity for HHS and its operating
divisions to reflect on its cybersecurity capabilities and
improve from one to the next. Today's hearing will allow us to
explore whether or not HHS has indeed taken advantage of these
opportunities in the way that we would hope and expect that the
Department has.
Given the sensitivity of some of the findings identified by
GAO, we have determined that it is appropriate for the bulk of
this hearing to take place in a closed session. After opening
remarks by Ranking Member DeGette, the subcommittee will vote
to enter a closed session and then proceed from there.
I want to thank our witnesses for appearing today.
And I now recognize Ms. DeGette for any public comments
before we vote to go into closed session.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Harper follows:]

OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DIANA DEGETTE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO
Ms. DeGette. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As you know, this committee has conducted a series of
oversight work focused on cybersecurity, such as at the
Department of Energy and HHS. GAO is doing critical work in
testing the cyber defenses at various HHS agencies, and this
report is the latest in that series.
To that end, I look forward to examining these issues in
more detail in executive session and to hearing what
commitments these agencies can make to address the
vulnerabilities.
And, with that, I yield back.
Mr. Harper. Ms. DeGette yields back.
The chair recognizes himself for a unanimous consent
request and to offer a motion.
Because of the sensitive nature of this hearing,
particularly its implications for national security, and after
consultations with the minority, I will offer a motion that the
subcommittee go into executive session.
I yield to the ranking member for any comments on this
procedure.
Ms. DeGette. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
As I stated before, given the sensitive nature of this
information, I support your motion.
Mr. Harper. The chair moves that, pursuant to clause 2(g)
of rule XI of the rules of the House, the remainder of this
hearing will be conducted in executive session to protect
information that might endanger national security.
Is there discussion on the motion?
Seeing none, if there is no discussion, pursuant to the
rule, a recorded vote is ordered. Pursuant to rule XI of the
U.S. House of Representatives, this will be a roll call vote.
The clerk call the roll.

will be closed to the public and open only to our witnesses, to
the members, and to essential staff.

[Material submitted for inclusion in the record follows:]
Prepared statement of Hon. Greg Walden
Mr. Chairman, thank you for holding today's hearing. As you
explained, we are here today to examine the state of
cybersecurity at CDC, and what the findings of this audit may
mean for HHS cybersecurity more broadly. However, it is
important to keep in mind that the issues and potential
consequences of GAO's findings at the CDC go far beyond simply
deficient technical controls.
In 2013, this Committee requested that the GAO examine in
detail the information security controls at four key HHS
agencies--CMS, FDA, CDC, and NIH. Three of those audits are now
complete, and the NIH is up next. Two years ago, upon the
release of the FDA audit, the Committee had to call FDA senior
leadership in a snowstorm to impress upon them to importance of
closing the 165 vulnerabilities--many of them incredibly
serious-identified by that GAO audit immediately.
We had hoped that the CDC audit would be better, but in
many ways it is worse. Not only are there more technical
recommendations--184 in this case--but they are more severe.
And, nearly a quarter of them appear to be duplicative of the
vulnerabilities in the FDA audit. That includes, by the way,
the vulnerability that caused the Committee to call over to FDA
in a snowstorm.
CDC today will discuss their efforts to date to remediate
the findings cited by GAO once GAO made them aware of the
various issues. I am glad that the CDC recognizes the severity
of the GAO's findings, and is aggressively moving to mitigate
these vulnerabilities. CDC also engaged a US-CERT ``hunt'' team
at the Committee's request to investigate potential intrusions.
When I spoke with Dr. Redfield yesterday he told me that fixing
these problems is a top priority.
We have many questions that I hope we can get answers to
today. For example, why did it take a third-party audit to
highlight the significant dangers that CDC's information
technology strategy created? Why didn't CDC recognize this
danger itself? And finally, if these findings and their
potential consequences were fully recognized over a year ago,
why wasn't the Committee told until the release of the
restricted report last month?
Chairman Harper highlighted some of the concerns around
certain vulnerabilities like Finding 38, which CDC has
confirmed existed in its vulnerable configuration for nearly 7
years. The implications of this finding are astounding. For
nearly 7 years, Finding 38 may have allowed a remote, Internet-
based attacker to access any CDC server, workstation, or other
networked device, including such CDC systems as the ones on
which the Federal Select Agent Platform or the Strategic
National Stockpile program depend. These are serious threats
with potentially grave consequences. And to make things worse,
8 other GAO findings suggest that CDC's audit and intrusion
detection capabilities were, and remain, so poor that CDC may
not have detected whether Finding 38 or other critical findings
were leveraged to penetrate the CDC.
The severity of the findings at CDC show that we are still
viewing cybersecurity as primarily a ``tech'' problem, when in
fact we have moved far beyond that. The vulnerabilities at CDC
were not merely a missing IT control deserving of a failing
audit grade, but a national security threat. And because the
appropriate amount of weight was not given to that fact a year
ago, we are now even less well-positioned to understand what
may have happened to--or, perhaps more accurately, who got
inside--CDC's networks in the nearly 7 years that the Finding
38 vulnerability existed.
I greatly appreciate the hard work of the GAO, and I know
the CDC does as well. The team that has done these audits at
the Committee's request does incredible work. We must not lose
sight of the context in which these vulnerabilities exist.
There are malicious actors that wish to cause us great harm,
and have already exploited vulnerabilities across the Federal
Government. This hearing is a critical step in gaining a better
understanding of what happened, so that we many ensure that all
parties understand the potential consequences, and we may
better position ourselves to ensure that it doesn't happen
again.
I want to thank our witnesses for testifying and look
forward to today's discussion. Thank you, and I yield back.
