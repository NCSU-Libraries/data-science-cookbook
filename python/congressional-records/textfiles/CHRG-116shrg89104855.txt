LEGISLATIVE BRANCH APPROPRIATIONS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2020
----------
WEDNESDAY, APRIL 10, 2019
U.S. Senate,
Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met at 3:23 p.m., in room SD-124, Dirksen
Senate Office Building, Hon. Cindy Hyde-Smith (Chairman)
presiding.
Present: Senators Hyde-Smith, Lankford, and Murphy.
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE AND CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE
OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR CINDY HYDE-SMITH
Senator Hyde-Smith. Good afternoon. The subcommittee will
come to order. I appreciate your attendance, and because we're
in between votes right now, we may have to recess, but we are
going to get as far as we can and then go make the second vote.
I'd like to welcome everyone to our third fiscal year 2020
budget hearing for the Legislative Branch Appropriations
Subcommittee. Today we have with us the Comptroller General of
the United States and head of the Government Accountability
Office, the Honorable Gene Dodaro, and the Director of the
Congressional Budget Office, Dr. Keith Hall.
Thank you for being here today to provide testimony to the
subcommittee regarding your fiscal year 2020 budget requests.
I'd also like to thank both of you for taking time to meet with
me before this hearing, and I greatly appreciate those
conversations and the opportunity to learn more about you and
your agencies.
Both GAO and CBO provide Congress with valuable information
that we, as lawmakers, use to make informed decisions to better
serve our constituents and this Nation. We appreciate and
recognize the time and resources which inform the analyses you
provide to us.
The total budget request for GAO is $647.6 million. This
represents an increase of $57.8 million, or 9.8 percent, above
the fiscal year 2019 enacted level. The increases would allow
GAO to reach its optimal staffing level of 3,250 FTE and
provide for investments in physical infrastructure and
Information Technology modernization.
The CBO request for fiscal year 2020 totals $53.6 million,
an increase of $2.8 million, or 5.6 percent, above the fiscal
year 2019 enacted level. This increase includes funding for
staff hired throughout fiscal year 2019 to improve transparency
as well as funding for new hires in fiscal year 2020. It also
would provide funds to maintain further development of critical
IT infrastructure.
I look forward to our discussion today and learning more
about the requests from each of your agencies.
Right now Senator Murphy is still voting, so when he gets
here, I will certainly turn to him for his opening statement.
I'm going to defer to Senator Lankford for any opening
statements you may have.
Senator Lankford. No, I'll just say thank you to both of
you and the work that you've already done, and grateful to be
able to receive your testimony today and look forward to
ongoing dialogue. Thank you.
Senator Hyde-Smith. Great. I will recognize each of you now
to make your statements.
And I will start with you, Mr. Dodaro.
STATEMENT OF HON. GENE DODARO, COMPTROLLER GENERAL OF
THE UNITED STATES AND HEAD OF THE U.S.
GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
Mr. Dodaro. Thank you very much, Chairman Hyde-Smith.
Good afternoon to you, Senator Lankford.
Nice to see both of you again.
I appreciate the opportunity to talk about our request for
fiscal year 2020.
First, I want to thank this subcommittee for the support
that you've given GAO in the past. We have provided a good
return on that investment. Last year, actions on our
recommendations saved over $75 billion, which is $124 back for
every dollar invested in GAO. This builds on a long track
record of producing financial benefits for the country.
When I testified last month before Congress on our latest
high-risk list update I mentioned that since 2006, actions on
our recommendations in the high-risk area saved over $350
billion.
Next month I will testify on our ninth annual report on
overlap duplication of fragmentation in the Federal Government.
I expect to announce that the financial benefits through
actions there, by both the Congress and the executive branch
have well exceeded the $178 billion that we mentioned last
year.
In addition to these financial benefits, we have other
actions on the recommendations that help improve the operations
and activities of a range of Federal agencies across the entire
Federal Government including public safety and security. We
have done work on elder abuse issues, lead in drinking water
for our schools, K-12 schools, and suicide prevention for
veterans. We've made recommendations on the opioid crisis, how
to strengthen security around airports, and a wide range of
other areas. It's important to note that we are not just about
producing financial benefits, we are helping improve government
performance and accountability.
GAO REQUEST
As you mentioned, Chairman Hyde-Smith, we're asking for
$647 million for next year. This will provide the full
complement of staff at 3,250 FTE, which we think we need in
order to meet the highest priority needs of the Congress. We
continue to serve over 90 percent of the standing committees
and most of the subcommittees by providing assistance. This
request will enable the GAO to meet the highest priority needs
across the committees and the Congress. I meet on a regular
basis with the Chair and Ranking Members of each of these
committees to make sure the GAO is addressing their highest
priority needs.
There are four areas in particular that the GAO would like
to continue to build our capacities on. The first is science
and technology issues. The emergence of science and technology
issues is transforming the way that we are learning,
communicating, educating, and changing the very face of warfare
in the future, whether you are talking artificial intelligence
or quantum computing.
Cryptocurrencies and blockchains are changing the nature of
how financial transactions are conducted and financial advice.
GAO has been asked by the Congress since 2002 to produce
technology assessments to advise the Congress on some of the
legal, ethical, regulatory, and other practical policy
implications of these new developing technologies.
Our work also requires that we look at weapons systems,
whether it's a Columbia-class nuclear submarine or the Joint
Strike Fighter. The GAO looks at space programs, satellite
programs, and healthcare, including technologies to more
rapidly detect infectious diseases. The GAO is looking at
antibiotic-resistance bacteria now.
In order to do our work, it is very important that we have
this capability. I have submitted to the subcommittee a plan
that it requested last year, last month, to establish a science
technology assessment and analysis group in GAO that builds
upon the groups that we already have. The plan also outlines
how GAO would propose to grow that team into the future because
these issues are going to be requiring Congress to respond
faster and faster. This evolution is going a lot faster than
the agrarian society to the Industrial Revolution. We are on a
new pace here.
Second is cybersecurity. It permeates everything across the
Federal Government. This year, based on the subcommittee's
help, the GAO expanded its team from 140 to 175 people. We are
able to hire people with these skills. We are undertaking a lot
of work. There needs to be a more comprehensive national and
global cybersecurity strategy that deals with supply chain
issues. I can talk more about this in the Q&A session if you
would like, but we have outlined 4 areas and 10 actions in the
cybersecurity area that our country needs to take. I am very
concerned that our country is not acting with the same sense of
urgency commensurate with the threat in the cybersecurity
realm. The issue with these advancements in technologies, will
get more complicated, not less.
The last two areas are the biggest spending areas in the
Federal Government. Defense, there's significant work that
we're doing there. I've been concerned about readiness levels.
Congress has required DOD to act on our recommendations and
readiness. They required us over the next several years to
assess their plan for rebuilding readiness.
Healthcare is the final area. It's the fastest growing area
of the Federal Government except perhaps for interest on our
debt, which is a separate discussion. We need to do more. Right
now, Medicare and Medicaid combined are over a trillion dollars
of the Federal Government's budget. By 2026, they are likely to
each be a trillion dollars over that amount, particularly
Medicaid if you count State funding as well.
These programs are growing rapidly. Medicare and Medicaid
have a high rate of improper payments. The GAO has made several
recommendations about payment policies that could save the
government money and not affect the healthcare that we provide
our citizenry under these two programs.
I know that you will give careful consideration to our
request. I thank you for holding this hearing, giving us the
opportunity. I will be prepared to answer questions at the
appropriate time.

gao highlights
Highlights of GAO-19-451T, a report to Subcommittee on the
Legislative Branch, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate.
Background
GAO's mission is to support Congress in meeting its constitutional
responsibilities and to help improve the performance and ensure the
accountability of the Federal Government for the benefit of the
American people. We provide nonpartisan, objective, and reliable
information to Congress, Federal agencies, and to the public, and
recommend improvements across the full breadth and scope of the Federal
Government's responsibilities.
GAO responded to requests from 90 percent of the standing full
committees of the Congress in fiscal year 2018. GAO issued 633 reports,
1,650 new recommendations, and testified before 48 congressional
committees 98 times. Congress used our work extensively to inform its
decisions on key fiscal year 2018 and 2019 legislation. Since fiscal
year 2000, GAO's work has resulted in:
--nearly $1 trillion dollars in financial benefits; and
--over 23,000 program and operational benefits that helped to change
laws, improve public services, and promote sound management
throughout government.
GAO remains an employer of choice in the public sector. The
Partnership for Public Service announced again in 2018 that GAO one of
the top places to work in the Federal Government, placing fourth
position among mid-size agencies and first for supporting diversity.

fiscal year 2020 budget request
Chairman Hyde-Smith, Senator Murphy, and Members of the
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss our fiscal year
2020 budget request. I greatly appreciate the subcommittee's support of
our efforts to serve the Congress and improve government performance,
accountability, and transparency.
Since 2014, this subcommittee has provided funding that has
resulted in our work achieving over $340 billion in financial benefits
and more than 6,300 other improvements in Federal programs and
operations for our government. In fiscal year 2018, GAO's work yielded
a record $75.1 billion in financial benefits, a return of about $124
for every dollar invested in GAO. We also identified 1,294 other
benefits that led to improved services and public safety for the
American people and program and operational improvements across the
government.
For fiscal year 2020, GAO is requesting $647.6 million in
appropriated funds, and authority to use $38.3 million in offsetting
receipts and reimbursements, a 9.8 percent increase. These resources
will fund 3,250 full-time equivalents (FTE). The funding requested will
also allow us to continue to make investments in our information
technology and infrastructure, security requirements, as well as
address long deferred building maintenance needs.
This level of funding will enable GAO to meet the highest priority
needs of the Congress, as we remain committed in helping Congress meet
its constitutional responsibilities for the benefit of the American
people. In fiscal year 2018, for example, we received 786 requests,
including hundreds of statutory requirements, for work from 90 percent
of the standing committees of Congress supporting a broad range of
oversight and legislative priorities. The activities planned for fiscal
year 2020 will better position GAO to assist the Congress in meeting
its legislative and oversight responsibilities, accomplish our mission
objectives and goals, and improve government performance and
accountability.
In fiscal year 2020, we will continue to support congressional
oversight across the wide array of government programs and operations.
We also will continue to increase our capabilities to review the
opportunities and challenges associated with evolving science and
technology issues; the risks and management needs to address complex
and growing cyber security developments; increased investments in the
Department of Defense; and rising healthcare costs.
In January, we established a new Science, Technology Assessment,
and Analytics team to continue and expand our focus on rapidly evolving
science and technology issues. The team will focus on: (1) conducting
technology assessments at the request of the Congress; (2) providing
technical assistance to Congress on science and technology matters; (3)
continuing to develop and use technical guides to assess major Federal
acquisitions and technology programs in areas such as cost estimating,
schedule planning and technology readiness; (4) supporting
congressional oversight of Federal science programs; and (5) advancing
GAO's ability to use data analytics in auditing.
We also will continue to further enhance our capacity to assess
efforts to protect our Nation from cyber threats. Specifically, we
recently highlighted urgent actions needed to ensure the cybersecurity
of our Nation. We also renamed our Information Technology team to
Information Technology and Cybersecurity in order to better reflect the
significant body of work the team does on protecting Federal
information systems, critical infrastructure, and individual privacy
from cyber threats. GAO will also support continued congressional
oversight of DoD's efforts to balance current operational deployments
with fulfilling the full spectrum of future military needs, as well as
the Federal Government's challenges in effectively and efficiently
managing healthcare programs.

meeting the priority needs of committees across congress
In fiscal year 2020, we will continue to support congressional
oversight across the wide array of government programs and operations.
We also will continue to increase our capabilities to review the
opportunities and challenges associated with evolving science and
technology issues; the risks and management needs to address complex
and growing cyber security developments; increased investments in the
Department of Defense; and rising healthcare costs.
assessing evolving science and technology issues
Rapid advances in technology and science play an increasingly
important role in our society. These potentially affect areas such as
economic competitiveness, improved medical care and information
security. The rapid development and use of these new disruptive
technologies test the government's and the Congress's ability to
evaluate their potential and assess their program and policy
implications.
Our work has reflected the need to research and assess technology
developments. In fiscal year 2018, we reported on the emergence and
implications of Artificial Intelligence, the benefits, risks, and
regulatory issues concerning Financial Technology (fintech), the need
for revised cost estimation and scheduling policies by the National
Science Foundation for large facilities, assessments of the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) major projects, and
critical infrastructure protection. We also used our technology
readiness assessment best practices guide to evaluate major technical
systems acquisitions such as those found at the Department of Defense
(DoD), Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Energy
(Energy), NASA and other agencies.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ We use these assessments in addition to two other best
practices guides for capital acquisitions: life cycles cost estimating
and project scheduling.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
To enhance our ability to provide Congress with thorough and
balanced analysis of technological and scientific developments that
affect our society, environment, and economy, we established the
Science, Technology Assessment, and Analytics team in January 2019. Our
new team will expand our support to Congress by:
--conducting technology assessments and providing technical services;
--reviewing science and technology programs and initiatives to assist
in oversight of Federal investments in research, development,
and advanced manufacturing;
--compiling and utilizing best practices in engineering sciences,
including cost, schedule, and technology readiness assessments;
and
--establishing an audit innovation lab to explore, pilot, and deploy
new advanced analytic capabilities, conduct research in
information assurance, and explore emerging technologies that
will impact future audit practices.
Technology Assessments. Our technology assessments explain the
consequences that certain technology will have on the Federal
Government--and on society as a whole.
--Economic competiveness. Our work has covered a range of topics
including artificial intelligence, connectivity and the
Internet of Things, innovation in data analytics, and 3D
printing.
--Energy and the environment. We have reported on topics like
improving municipal freshwater scarcity, reducing freshwater
use in hydraulic fracturing and thermoelectric power plant
cooling, and climate engineering.
--Healthcare. We have evaluated enabling rapid diagnoses of
infectious diseases and the implications of nanomanufacturing
on human health. We are currently investigating the impact of
artificial intelligence on healthcare.
--Homeland security. We have examined the use of explosive detection
technologies to protect passenger trains, and the use of
biometrics for border security.
GAO has published a number of technology assessments on established
and emerging technology. We continue to provide evidence-based analysis
to assist policymakers with the privacy and security implications of
technology, as well as the management of Federal investments in
technology and science. We also develop best practice guides, such as
our technology readiness assessment guide. Some of the key reports GAO
has issued include:

Management of Federal Technology and Science Programs
GAO also assess the management and coordination of Federal research
and development efforts, including investments in scientific facilities
(such as telescopes and research vessels) and emerging technologies
(like synthetic biology and quantum computing).
[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Ongoing and planned technology assessments in fiscal year 2019
include freshwater technologies in agriculture, the implications of
artificial intelligence on healthcare, 5G wireless communications
systems, and epidemiological models for emerging infectious diseases.
The requested resources will enable us to expand and accelerate our
work including potential technology readiness assessments of complex
technical acquisitions such as nuclear modernization programs, the
Army's Next Generation Combat Vehicle program, DHS border protection
technologies, and Uranium Processing Facility, among others. To bolster
the new team, GAO has begun efforts to recruit additional staff with
expertise in:
--biological/life sciences for emerging infectious diseases,
epidemiology, synthetic biology, biosafety, and biosecurity
work;
--computer/systems/electrical engineering for digital and
communications technologies (i.e., 5G wireless, Blockchain,
quantum cryptography, artificial intelligence/machine learning
systems);
--applied math/statistics/computer science for advanced analytics/
data science/data engineering;
--nuclear physics for nuclear nonproliferation, waste management,
weapons systems analysis, radiation/nuclear detection systems,
quantum computing; and
--physics/aerospace engineering for hypersonics, advanced weapons
systems, space systems, unmanned systems.
Based on interest expressed by various committees of jurisdiction,
potential future work could focus on digital ledger technologies such
as Blockchain, opioid-addiction vaccine development, autonomous
vehicles, and regenerative medicine, among many others. Also, as we do
in all areas, we will make our expert staff available to Members and
staff to share knowledge and insight on technical and scientific
matters.
Consistent with the 2019 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill,
Conference Report, we provided a detailed plan to this committee in
March 2019. The report outlined our expanded capabilities on science
and technology related issues, specific plans for additional staff and
other resources, and the products and services the Team will provide to
Congress. The document also describes the governance structures that
will apply to the team's work, including technology assessments. To
inform this plan, we conducted outreach to subject matter experts and
stakeholders. These include Members of Congress, congressional
committees, alumni of the former Office of Technology Assessment, major
scientific associations, the National Academies, and leading science
and technology policy experts in universities and nonprofit
institutions.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ As of March 15, 2019, GAO met with more than 30 expert
stakeholders. GAO plans to continue to meet with stakeholders
throughout the remainder of fiscal year 2019.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
addressing complex and growing cyber security threats
Federal agencies and the Nation's critical infrastructures--such as
energy, transportation systems, communications, and financial
services--are dependent on cyber information systems and electronic
data to carry out operations and to process, maintain, and report
essential information. Our work in cybersecurity includes:
--Critical infrastructure protection. We work on how to protect the
Nation's critical infrastructure--including financial markets,
telecommunications, the national airspace system, electricity
grid, and oil and gas pipeline sector.
--Federal information systems. We evaluate the cybersecurity of key
Federal agencies, such as the Internal Revenue Service and the
Department of Homeland Security.
--Privacy. We evaluate Federal efforts to ensure the privacy of
individuals in response to emerging technologies (such as the
Internet of Things and artificial intelligence), the collection
and use of personal information in the private sector through
social media, and privacy in government programs (e.g., Federal
student aid and Medicare).
We also will continue to further enhance our capacity to assess
efforts to protect our Nation from cyber threats. Specifically, we
recently updated our cybersecurity high-risk area based on our recent
evaluations. We did so to highlight urgent actions that are needed by
Federal agencies to ensure the cybersecurity of our Nation.\3\ We also
renamed our Information Technology team. Its new name, Information
Technology and Cybersecurity (ITC), better reflects the significant
body of work the team does on protecting Federal information systems,
critical infrastructure, and individual privacy and sensitive data from
cyber threats. To reinforce GAO's cybersecurity audit capabilities, the
ITC team is actively recruiting additional resources, including those
participating in the CyberCorps Scholarship for Service program. The
new recruits will augment our cadre of experts who can assess the
criticality of cyber risks, both present and future, as well as
evaluate the government's complex and multi-faceted attempts to address
them.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ High-Risk Series: Urgent Actions Are Needed to Address
Cybersecurity Challenges Facing the Nation, GAO-18-622 (Washington,
D.C: Sept. 6, 2018).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
cyber-based threats to the nation's systems and critical infrastructure
The cyberattacks suffered by the Office of Personnel Management,
Equifax, and other large organizations in recent years highlight the
increasing importance of cybersecurity. Threats from state and non-
state actors are growing in sophistication, scope, and impact. These
increasing threats could have a serious, or even potentially
catastrophic, impact.
Attackers target increasing volumes of sensitive and Internet-
accessible data by using ever-more powerful tools like automation,
social media manipulation, vulnerability exploitation, and insider
access to carry out attacks. These threats pose growing dangers for the
entire Federal Government, the Nation's infrastructure and democratic
processes, and the privacy and financial security of American citizens.
As Congress turns to GAO for insightful analysis and advice to
address these rapidly evolving threats, recruiting top-tier cyber
talent to augment our current audit workforce is critical. Additional
resources will allow us to quickly expand our audit capabilities
related to key components of the cyber high-risk area, including
evaluating efforts to protect Federal systems, critical infrastructure,
and individual privacy from cyber threats. Over the next 2 years, our
planned efforts include assessing the Federal Government's efforts to
establish and implement a comprehensive national cyber strategy, to
evaluate government-wide initiatives to implement continuous
diagnostics and monitoring capabilities, and to establish effective
risk management processes at Federal agencies. GAO is also evaluating
key agency capabilities for responding to security incidents and data
breaches, as well as assessing their security postures through detailed
vulnerability assessments of agency network defenses.
Our work on the protection of critical infrastructure will continue
to focus on two areas: (1) the cybersecurity of specific sectors,\4\
including the electricity grid and the financial services and
communications sectors, and (2) the effectiveness of the public-private
partnership model as a framework for protecting the Nation's critical
assets from cyber threats.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ Critical infrastructure includes systems and assets so vital to
the United States that incapacitating or destroying them would have a
debilitating effect on national security. These critical
infrastructures are grouped by the following 16 industries or
``sectors'': chemical; commercial facilities; communications; critical
manufacturing; dams; defense industrial base; emergency services;
energy; financial services; food and agriculture; government
facilities; healthcare and public health; information technology;
nuclear reactors, materials, and waste; transportation systems; and
water and wastewater systems.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As part of our work on critical assets, we are also starting work
evaluating the cybersecurity implications of the move to 5G in the
communications sector. Our work on the protection of individual privacy
will also continue to focus on two areas: (1) Federal efforts to
protect consumers from data breaches and their after effect; and (2)
whether Federal agencies are applying data protection best practices
when performing their own critical mission activities.
overseeing increased investments in the department of defense
The Department of Defense (DoD) faces significant challenges in
responding to a complex and rapidly evolving national security
environment that includes instability in key regions of the world,
cyber threats, and terrorist activities. As DoD works to sustain and
advance its military superiority and achieve efficiencies that can be
reinvested to increase readiness, it continues to undergo one of the
most significant organizational realignments since the Goldwater-
Nichols Act of 1986.
As you know, in support of DoD's mission, Congress entrusted DoD
with considerable resources, about $686 billion in discretionary funds
enacted in fiscal year 2019, and Congress has directed GAO to review a
broad range of DoD's activities to assist Congress in its oversight of
this investment. Since 2006, GAO's work has resulted in 4,072
recommendations to DoD designed to strengthen the department's programs
and operations. These recommendations focus on critical challenges
facing the department, including rebuilding readiness, managing space
capabilities, strengthening cyber defenses, acquiring and sustaining
major weapon systems, and addressing inefficiencies in the military
health system, among others.
GAO's work has led to the designation of seven DoD areas on our
High Risk List, including financial management, weapon systems
acquisitions, business systems modernization, and support
infrastructure management, as well as the government-wide personnel
security clearance process, for which DoD has significant
responsibilities. Collectively, our work has resulted in over $70
billion in financial benefits since fiscal year 2015. For example, we
identified $36 billion in financial benefits from improvements to DoD's
weapon systems acquisitions processes, an estimated $3.1 billion from
improvements to DoD's method for setting standard fuel prices, and $849
million through identifying unexpended and unobligated balances in
DoD's Military Personnel accounts.
GAO anticipates continuing to support congressional oversight of
DoD by testifying during congressional hearings, providing quick-turn-
around technical assistance, and issuing special oversight publications
across a broad range of areas.
GAO will continue to interact extensively with committee staff on
the Senate and House Armed Services Committees as they draft the annual
National Defense Authorization Act, providing input on many legislative
provisions based on GAO's work. For example, Congress approved a budget
reduction of $1.3 billion for the Navy's frigate program, based on
GAO's finding that more knowledge was needed before contracts were
awarded.
GAO will also support congressional appropriators by conducting
budget justification reviews on a variety of topics and defense
operations and maintenance, weapon system acquisitions, personnel, and
defense healthcare. GAO's review of DoD's 2019 research, development,
and procurement budget request identified almost $2 billion in
potential rescissions and reductions. GAO also will continue to issue
annual ``Quick Look'' reports assessing the cost, schedule, and
performance of about 80 major defense acquisition programs, helping
support the Congress in overseeing the department's estimated $1.5
trillion in future spending on these systems.
GAO also continues to assess DoD's efforts to strengthen its
financial management practices and efforts to obtain a clean opinion on
its financial statements. DoD has never received a clean opinion on its
financial statements, which prevents GAO from expressing an opinion on
the consolidated financial statements of the Federal Government. Long-
standing weaknesses in DoD's financial management adversely affect the
economy, efficiency, and effectiveness of its operations. The same
financial management problems that prevented DoD from being auditable
in the past, adversely impact its operations and its ability to achieve
broader business transformation goals.
We anticipate a growing demand from the Congress for GAO's work
regarding DoD. In the last year, for example, Congress signaled a
continued emphasis on DoD's new Chief Management Officer as the driving
force behind the department's business reform efforts. We have a number
of ongoing audits assessing DoD's progress in this area, including
reviewing DoD's efforts to implement cross-functional business reform
teams and to achieve enterprise-wide efficiencies.
GAO will also support continued congressional interest in DoD's
efforts to balance current operational deployments with training and
equipping forces capable of fulfilling the full spectrum of military
operations. We will continue to assess DoD's efforts to sustain its
major weapon systems and address challenges from aging depot
maintenance facilities. We will also review the plans, organization,
and capabilities of the department's cyber operations; the safety and
effectiveness of the U.S. strategic nuclear force; and DoD's
investments in hypersonic weapons and associated defensive systems. We
also anticipate further congressional interest in DoD's long-range
strike fighter and next generation air dominance acquisition efforts,
as well as a broad array of space-based programs.
Regarding DoD's efforts to control costs, we plan to continue
assessing the costs, schedule, and technical capabilities of the
Columbia class nuclear submarine program. We also plan to assess DoD's
efforts to achieve efficiencies and reduce overlap and duplication,
such as across its defense agencies and field activities. We will also
continue to assess the department's approach and methodologies for
improving the efficiency of the military health system and determining
its medical workforce needs.
We will support the Congress in assessing DoD's efforts in
implementing other key legislative requirements, including acquisition
reform legislation aimed at streamlining DoD's processes for buying
weapon systems.
With the resources requested, GAO will expand our work within and
beyond these areas, helping ensure that we address the issues most
important to the Congress and taxpayer during this critical period for
DoD and our country's national defense.
managing rising health care costs
Estimated at $1 trillion in fiscal year 2018, growth in Federal
spending for major healthcare programs has exceeded the growth of GDP
historically and is projected to grow faster than the economy. These
healthcare programs include Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's
Health Insurance Program, along with Federal subsidies for health
insurance purchased through the marketplaces established by the
Affordable Care Act (ACA) and related spending. Federal spending also
supports healthcare for American Indians, veterans, servicemembers and
public health priorities, such as preventing and responding to
infectious disease outbreaks and bio health threats. These Federal
commitments to healthcare programs are a key driver of the nation's
fiscal spending. Growth in Federal spending on healthcare is driven
both by increasing healthcare spending per person and by increasing
enrollment, in part stemming from the aging of the population.
The Federal Government faces challenges in effectively and
efficiently managing healthcare programs. Specifically, the demands to
meet Americans' health needs are growing in volume and complexity while
oversight is becoming more challenging. Understanding these
complexities and offering fact-based recommendations to address them
requires advanced policy and analytical expertise. Congress has
frequently sought our healthcare policy expertise on a range of
healthcare issues. In 2018, we issued 85 products that examined access
to and quality of care, drug availability and pricing, program
expenditures and integrity, the protection of public health, and
healthcare markets, among other topics. We made 123 recommendations to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of Federal healthcare
spending, and documented about $40 billion in savings in 2018 alone by
agencies taking action on our recommendations.
GAO has also focused on healthcare issues through its biennial High
Risk Report. With our 2017 High Risk Update, we designated the Indian
Health Service (IHS) as high-risk. This area joins four other high-risk
areas related to healthcare: Medicare, Medicaid, the Food and Drug
Administration, and Department of Veteran Affairs (VA) Health Care.
In addition to these audit products, we annually respond to dozens
of requests for informal assistance regarding Federal healthcare policy
and programs. The demand for this type of assistance continued in 2018,
as committees considered evolving and complex healthcare policy
changes. These requests ranged from making our subject matter experts
available to answer detailed questions about the interworking of
programs to providing time-sensitive data analysis.
Our healthcare policy experts also advise me on my statutory
responsibilities for appointing members to six different health-related
commissions.\5\ Carefully considering each appointment to these
commissions requires a high-degree of professional judgment and subject
matter expertise and demands a significant investment of time by our
healthcare senior executives.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ GAO has responsibility for appointing members to six healthcare
commissions, including the Health Information Technology Advisory
Committee; Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access Commission; Medicare
Payment Advisory Commission; Patient-Centered Outcomes Research
Institute (PCORI) Governing Board; PCORI Methodology Committee; and the
Physician-Focused Payment Model Technical Advisory Committee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Additional resources for our healthcare work would not only allow
us to respond more quickly to congressional requests, it would allow us
to expand our work on the drivers of healthcare costs. For example, the
continued growth of the Medicare and Medicaid programs drives Federal
spending on healthcare and these programs are expected to place
additional strain on the Federal budget in the coming years, as each
program is projected to top $1 trillion in annual expenditures within
the next decade.
With decades of experience, our expertise positions us to examine
the growth of Medicare spending relative to other components of the
healthcare system (e.g., inpatient and post-acute care) and ask which
is growing higher and faster. Our expertise also positions us to
examine the incentives created by certain Medicare payment policies
that drive excess and inappropriate utilization of services.
Furthermore, our staff's Medicaid expertise positions us to explore
issues like access, financing arrangements, delivery, and program
integrity, all critical issues that are made more complex by the
variation among state Medicaid programs.
In addition to examining the sustainability of these large Federal
healthcare programs, we would continue to examine how these healthcare
programs and markets affect the daily lives of Americans and
communities. For example, given:
--The complexities of the prescription drug market, we would continue
to provide objective, unbiased examinations of trends in drug
costs and identify options to control these costs.
--Congressional interest and the ongoing opioid epidemic, we would
expand our work examining the Federal Government's effort to
curb drug misuse.\6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ Congress directed GAO to conduct over a dozen studies in the
2018 Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery
and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Our high-risk designation of veterans' healthcare issues, we would
provide real-time assessments of significant VA initiatives in
these areas.
gao information technology and building infrastructure
The resources we received for fiscal year 2019, and request for
fiscal year 2020, will allow GAO to make strategic investments in
information technology (IT), and GAO's facilities infrastructure.
Funding in these areas enables GAO to make sound capital investments in
new technology and address important funding requirements in support of
our building facilities that will increase efficiency, lower operating
costs, and allow us to increase our rental revenue.
Information Technology. GAO has a range of business applications,
many of which rely on outdated technologies. A multi-year, multi-phase
effort to improve our aging IT infrastructure is underway. This effort
will allow us to further streamline business operations, increase staff
efficiency and productivity, improve access to information, and
facilitate a more agile and mobile workforce, all in a more secure
environment. This modernization effort will include several components,
some of which are discussed below.
In fiscal year 2019 and fiscal year 2020, we will:
--Continue our efforts to modernize content development,
distribution, and publishing our reports. This effort, New
Blue, will allow our reports to be formatted for and consumed
on any Internet-connected device. GAO will be publishing
reports from each mission team in preparation for full
deployment. Initial stakeholder feedback from congressional
staff on New Blue has been very positive, specifically, the
ability to access GAO products remotely for use during
congressional hearings.
--Finish rolling out cloud-based technology to provide enhanced
Unified Communication Tools (UCT) and collaboration
capabilities within GAO for an increasingly mobile workforce.
UCT supports our mobile workforce/virtual presence goals to
reduce the need for travel among field offices and
headquarters, in addition to audit locations. This effort will
modernize our suite of telecommunications tools, which will
facilitate greater video conferencing, audio, data sharing,
reduce redundant implementation and maintenance costs, and
standardize the infrastructure that supports voice and data
usage. In addition, this effort will migrate telecommunications
infrastructure to a cloud hosted solution, which will reduce
expenditures and fully integrate with enhanced collaboration
tools.
--Deploy a cloud-based Web Content Management solution for GAO's
external web site, www.gao.gov, which will better enable mobile
content and increase customer satisfaction.
--Upgrade the virtual desktop infrastructure \7\ to be more
responsive to staff needs and better enable staff to conduct
analysis and develop content. This effort will include
upgrading the operating environment on our desktops to Windows
10 prior to Windows 7 being sunset in 2020.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) is virtualization
technology that hosts a desktop operating system on a centralized
server in a data center.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--Implement software enhancements to automate and improve how GAO
receives complaints regarding fraud, waste, and abuse through
GAO's Fraudnet portal.
--Define the requirements to replace our decades old document and
records management system, which houses the supporting
documentation for our audit engagements and operational support
programs. We are looking to move to a cloud-based Enterprise
Content Management solution that provides enhanced
functionality, including security, knowledge management,
workflow automation, and business process management.
This solution will improve existing document and records management
capabilities, and will do so with less administrative burden on
employees. In addition, the solution will radically improve our ability
to share knowledge across the agency and automate many routine
workflows for engagement management and execution as well as for
internal operations. This will free staff to focus their energies on
content development and client and customer service. We expect to
acquire and begin implementation of the solution in fiscal year 2020.
--Replace the agency's outdated Learning Management and Performance
Management systems with a cloud-based Talent Management
information system to track and manage training and development
activities of GAO staff.
We also plan to expand our IT capacity to meet the demands of a
larger GAO staff and support the new STAA Team and Audit Innovation
Lab.
Facilities and Security. While most of GAO's staff is located at
its Headquarters in Washington, DC, GAO maintains a presence in
strategic locations throughout the country. GAO is always working to
ensure our headquarters and field office locations operate as
efficiently as possible, and we continue to reduce our real property
footprint as we identify opportunities.
In fiscal year 2018, GAO consolidated space in its headquarters
building to maximize efficiency, freeing up over 40,000 square feet for
use by another Federal agency and increasing GAO's rental income. In a
further effort to cut costs and reduce our real estate footprint, GAO
is strategically moving its field offices into federally owned space as
commercial leases expire. For example, GAO recently moved its San
Francisco Office from a commercial lease in the financial district to a
Federal building in Oakland.
Over the next 2 years, GAO is also looking at options to relocate
staff in Los Angeles and Chicago from commercial buildings. GAO is
requesting additional funding related to these office moves to ensure
we have funding needed for fixed costs related to moves and other
expenses related to the office transitions. In addition, as reported in
our fiscal year 2018 financial statements, GAO has over $29 million of
deferred but necessary maintenance at its headquarters building. This
includes heating and air conditioning infrastructure and major
electrical equipment that are original to our 67-year old building and
past their useful life. Additional funds will help enable this work and
protect these valuable assets from quickening deterioration.
Increased Classified Work. In recent years, GAO has received an
increasing number of mandates and congressional requests for reviews
that require GAO staff to have access to classified agency information,
as well as reviews that require accessing information at higher
classification levels. Further, GAO's Procurement Law division hears
bid protests that involve classified information as part of its
statutory responsibility for adjudicating bid protests of government
contracts.
Given this increased demand, GAO began making corresponding
infrastructure investments in fiscal year 2017 and fiscal year 2018.
For example, GAO has increased the size of its secure space available
in its headquarters for processing classified information at both the
Secret and Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information levels.
Additional funds in fiscal year 2020 will help enable GAO to make
further cost- effective technological and infrastructure improvements
to support the anticipated increase in work involving classified
information, such as
--upgrading and deploying additional secure video teleconference
equipment for field offices;
--a new case management system to more efficiently track personnel
security clearances;
--a new Classified Enterprise Content Management solution to enhance
processing of classified products; and
--networked Top Secret and Sensitive Compartmented Information
computer processing capabilities.
assisting the congress in shaping legislation
GAO continues to be recognized for its non-partisan, objective,
fact-based, and professional analyses across the full breadth and scope
of the Federal Government's responsibilities and the extensive
interests of Congress.
Since our last budget request, Congress used GAO's work to make
important legislative decisions. Examples linked directly to GAO's work
include:
--The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019. Based on GAO work,
Congress directs:
--DoD to (1) mitigate the effects of flooding on roads and
infrastructure on domestic installations that are vital to
military operations; and (2) improve oversight of its
global real property portfolio;
--VA to (1) modernize and improve its appeals process; (2) improve
the accuracy and fairness of Gulf War illness claims; (3)
retrofit facilities to eliminate barriers to care for women
veterans; (4) report on progress to improve oversight of
the controlled substance inspection program; and (5)
improve staffing, recruitment, and retention strategies for
physicians;
--DOE to (1) better account for fraudulent spending or other
improper payments; (2) improve contract auditing and the
tracking of meaningful data for fraud, waste, and abuse in
its contracts; and (3) improve the Office of River
Protection's ability to carry out oversight of its
contractors' quality assurance programs.
--The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2019.
Reflecting our past work, the Congress directs DoD to:
--develop a plan to rebuild military readiness in 5 warfighting
domains, including ground, air, sea, space, and cyberspace,
as well as requiring GAO to annually review the
department's plan through 2022;
--provide military servicemembers with training to enhance their
employability within 1 year prior to their separation, and
improve related performance reporting and monitoring;
--require the Navy to provide detailed budget information for
multi-billion dollar aircraft carrier dismantlement and
disposal activities; and
--require the Secretary of Defense to designate a component
responsible for coordinating efforts to acquire a
modernized Global Positioning System receiver, to maximize
the government's return on a multi-billion dollar
investment.
--In addition, a House report accompanying the Act directs DoD to:
--use policy and technological solutions to manage risk and secure
classified information and systems to counter insider
threats; and
--urge the Secretary of the Air Force and Secretary of the Navy, in
concert with the F-35 Joint Program Office, to reduce F-35
sustainment costs.
--The Good Accounting Obligation in Government Act (GAO-IG Act).
Signed into law on January 3, 2019, the act requires certain
Federal agencies:
--to include a report in their annual budget justification that
identifies the implementation status of each public GAO
recommendation that has been outstanding for at least 1
year and that not been implemented.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ For GAO's own reporting in response to the GAO-IG Act, see page
30.
--The 2018 Omnibus Appropriations Act. Based on GAO's work, the
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congress directs:
--the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to research the
overmedication of veterans that led to deaths, suicides,
and mental health disorders;
--DoD to align its (1) structure, (2) statutory parameters, and (3)
regulatory guidance across Federal prescription drug buying
programs to increase its buying power and reduce costs;
--DHS to (1) develop performance metrics for all deployed border
security, (2) evaluate the individual and collective effect
of deployed technologies, and (3) assess progress;
--DHS to regularly assess advanced protective technologies for
cybersecurity; and
--Federal agencies, such as DoD, National Cybersecurity and
Communications Center, and Bureau of Indian Affairs, to
report on how they plan to implement GAO recommendations.
--The National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2018.
Reflecting our past work, the Congress directs DoD to:
--improve its budget guidelines, cost savings, leadership of
business operations, military readiness goals and
implementation strategies, and reduce vulnerabilities in
military aircraft and risks to military installations from
climate change;
--increase reporting on the Columbia class nuclear submarine to
keep the program on track;
--change its space leadership structure;
--reinstate annual reports on the time required to conduct
investigations, adjudicate cases, and grant security
clearances; and
--establish new ways for agencies to modernize their legacy
information technology.
--The Disaster Recovery Reform Act of 2018. In October 2018, based in
part on GAO's work, Congress passed the 2018 Disaster Recovery
Reform Act, which directs the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) to:
--develop a National Public Infrastructure Pre-Disaster Mitigation
fund to allow for a greater investment in building
resilience before a disaster occurs;
--make Federal disaster assistance available to State and local
governments for building code administration and
enforcement;
--reconsider the factors it uses to evaluate a jurisdiction's
request for a major Federal disaster declaration; and
--update Congress on the development of a national preparedness
assessment and efforts to avoid duplication across
preparedness grants.
Federal funding for disaster assistance since 2005 is approaching
half a trillion dollars (about $430 billion), most recently for
hurricanes and wildfires in 2017 and 2018. These costs are expected to
increase as extreme weather events become more frequent and intense.
Increasing reliance on Federal assistance is a key source of Federal
fiscal exposure. Since adding limiting the Federal Government's
exposure by better managing climate change risks to our High Risk List
in 2013, we have made several recommendations to help improve
resilience to potential disasters.
financial and program benefits
Financial Benefits. In fiscal year 2018, financial benefits
resulting from our work included (1) revising spending limits for
Medicaid demonstration projects to assure that they are budget-neutral
($36.8 billion); (2) helping the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid
Services (CMS) achieve and measure the benefits of its fraud prevention
system ($1.3 billion); (3) identifying unexpended and unobligated
balances in selected DoD accounts and proposing changes in its fuel
pricing methodology ($5.3 billion); and (4) identifying unexpended and
unobligated balances in DoD's Military Personnel accounts ($849
million).
Other Benefits. Many other benefits resulting from our work led to
program and operational improvements. In fiscal year 2018, we recorded
1,294 of these other benefits. For example, our work on public safety
and security:
--positioned U.S. Customs and Border Protection to better protect
U.S. manufacturers from economic harm and U.S. consumers from
potential risks posed by counterfeit products sold online;
--resulted in comprehensive ready-for-sea inspections of Navy ships
based in Japan and changes to sleep schedules after deadly
collisions in the Pacific highlighted training, maintenance,
and manning shortfalls that had contributed to insufficient
sleep time for sailors;
--led the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to begin
updating and improving the risk assessment and strategy it uses
to (1) secure airport perimeters, and (2) control access to
restricted areas to better assess security issues at airports
nationwide; and
--prompted the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of National
Drug Control Policy to begin developing results-oriented
measures, such as reductions in overdose deaths, to help them
assess progress made in combatting the Nation's opioid
epidemic.
Similarly, our work related to vulnerable populations:
--contributed to the Congress passing legislation to strengthen the
Nation's data on elder abuse by requiring annual data
collection and reporting to support national prevention policy;
and
--led the Federal Communications Commission to begin measuring the
effectiveness of industry efforts to prevent wireless network
outages helping to ensure that Americans who rely solely on
them have access during emergencies.
In addition, our work in the healthcare area:
--prompted the Indian Health Service (HIS) to publish wait-time
standards for primary care and urgent care visits to help it
monitor patient access to care;
--led CMS to establish regular checks for identifying duplicate
health coverage in both Medicaid and the health insurance
exchange marketplaces, thereby helping to minimize the risk of
the Federal Government paying twice for an individual's health
insurance coverage; and
--prompted the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Drug
Enforcement Administration to formalize procedures for sharing
information that would allow FDA to better manage drug
shortages.
Furthermore, our work in the area of agency operations:
--led FEMA to (1) pilot a data sharing process with States to allow
it to identify potentially duplicative disaster assistance
payments, and (2) make plans to create a similar process to
manage future disasters;
--prompted the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to
issue formal guidance and implementation guidelines to help
Federal agencies continually assess their employees'
eligibility to hold security clearances and to do so uniformly;
and
--prompted the Congress to require Federal agencies to inform active
duty military servicemembers of their eligibility to receive
student loans at a 6 percent interest rate to better ensure
timely access to these loans and prevent overpayments.
evaluating federal disaster response and recovery issues
The Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements
Act of 2017 provided GAO with $14 million to conduct unanticipated
disaster oversight and audit work associated with the catastrophic
hurricanes and wildfires in 2017. GAO is evaluating a variety of topics
including disaster contracting, response challenges, progress in
multiple Federal recovery programs, fraud prevention and internal
controls, and is identifying recommendations to improve Federal actions
in all these areas.
So far, GAO has completed 11 disaster-related reports and has 25
additional ongoing audit engagements. Specifically, we have reported on
the initial Federal efforts to respond to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and
Maria, as well as the California wildfires. We have also reported on
disaster-related Federal spending and identified a number of long-term
recovery challenges in disaster-impacted areas, such as Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands. Further, we identified challenges related to
FEMA's disaster workforce and recommended actions to address weaknesses
in Federal disaster contracting practices.
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
In regard to ongoing work, we are evaluating disaster recovery
programs for individuals and those with disabilities, efforts to
strengthen disaster resilience and better prepare for future disasters,
and efforts to restore the power grid in Puerto Rico, among other
issues. Given the number of ongoing engagements and our reporting
schedule, we anticipate that GAO will use all of the $14 million in
disaster funds by the end of fiscal year 2020. A complete list of the
reports issued and audits currently underway is included as Enclosure
II.
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
building bodies of knowledge
Through the products we issued in fiscal year 2018, we continued to
build on bodies of work related to our three broad strategic goals to
(1) address current and emerging challenges to the well-being and
financial security of the American people; (2) help the Congress
respond to changing security threats and the challenges of global
interdependence; and (3) help transform the Federal Government to
address national challenges. Examples include:
--Protection of children. We reported on the need to (1) improve
Federal support to help states recruit and retain foster care
families to meet demand; (2) develop guidance for states to
help them better apply protections for substance-affected
infants; (3) consider discipline disparities for Black
students, boys, and students with disabilities in K-12 public
schools; and (4) update guidance to better monitor lead in
school drinking water.
--Support of Veterans. We reported on the need for VA to improve its
oversight and evaluation of the effectiveness of its suicide
prevention outreach activities. We found that VA's outreach
activities dropped off in 2017 and 2018, and the office
responsible for these activities lacked consistent leadership.
We also found that VA did not have clear goals for evaluating
the effectiveness of its outreach activities.
We also reported on the need for (1) DoD to improve its monitoring of
and reporting on its transitioning veterans program; (2) VA to further
assess its performance and progress toward meeting its opioid safety
goals for veterans; and (3) VHA to collect better data and evaluate its
strategies for improving physician staffing, recruitment, and
retention.
--Advancement of healthcare. We reported on the need to (1) better
secure the electronic health information of Medicare
beneficiaries; (2) improve Federal oversight of the health and
welfare of beneficiaries receiving Medicaid assisted living
services; and (3) improve assessments of individuals' needs for
home and community based services.
--Oversight of military readiness. We continued to monitor DoD's
efforts to rebuild military readiness and reported on the need
to (1) better plan for sustaining various military aircraft,
including the new F-35; (2) reassess the utilization and
organization of the Air Force F-22 Raptor fleet; (3) improve
maintenance of the Navy's submarine fleet and the Army's
Patriot missile defense system; and (4) clarify policies and
gather reliable data to manage the impact of time away from
home on service members and their families.
--Assessment of technology and science. We reported on (1) Artificial
Intelligence applications in four areas--cybersecurity,
automated vehicles, criminal justice, and financial services;
(2) sustainable chemical innovation, new approaches that
improve the chemistry behind medicines, personal care products,
and other everyday items to reduce environmental impacts; (3)
technologies to mitigate electromagnetic risks to the U.S.
electric grid; and (4) quantum computing, synthetic biology,
and other potentially transformational research and
considerations for U.S. competitiveness.
--Designation of High Risk areas. In our latest March 2019 update,
the ratings for seven areas improved, two to the point of
coming off the list--Department of Defense Supply Chain
Management and Mitigating Gaps in Weather Satellite Data. The
rankings for more than half of the over 30 areas on the list
remained largely unchanged with three regressing. We also added
VA Acquisition Management to the list after identifying seven
VA contracting challenges. VA has one of the most significant
acquisition functions in the Federal government, in costs and
numbers of contracts. Another issue--the Government-wide
Personnel Security Clearance Process--was added to the list in
January 2018 due to growing concerns about security clearance
backlogs and other problems.
In fiscal year 2018, our high-risk work in 35 areas resulted in 166
reports, 49 testimonies, $46.8 billion in financial benefits, and 526
other benefits. Financial benefits to the Federal Government due to
progress in addressing high-risk areas over the past 13 years (fiscal
year 2006 through fiscal year 2018) totaled nearly $350 billion or an
average of about $27 billion per year. The updated list is included as
Enclosure I.
--Identification of Fragmentation, Overlap, and Duplication. Our
eighth annual report identified 68 new actions across 23 new
program areas that could reduce fragmentation, overlap, and
duplication, or provide other cost savings and revenue
enhancement opportunities across the Federal Government.
Congress and executive branch agencies addressed 724 of the
actions identified from 2011 to 2017, leading to about $178
billion in financial benefits; $125 billion had accrued through
2017, with $53 billion more expected. An updated Fragmentation,
Overlap, and Duplication report will be issued May 2019.
focusing on congressional priorities
Serving Our Clients. In fiscal year 2018, we issued 633 reports and
made 1,650 new recommendations. Our senior executives were asked to
testify 98 times before 48 separate committees or subcommittees on
topics including key risks for the 2020 Census, improper payments under
Medicaid, national defense preparedness, border security, and the
Nation's cybersecurity challenges. The table that follows lists
examples of topics GAO addressed in testimony in fiscal year 2018,
grouped by our three external strategic goals.

Outreach Efforts. I continued my regular meetings with the Chairs
and Ranking Members of congressional committees to obtain their views
on GAO's work, including their priorities, and to discuss opportunities
and challenges facing our Nation.
I also sent letters to the heads of most Federal departments to
acknowledge the actions taken to date to implement our prior
recommendations and to draw their attention to priority recommendations
still requiring their attention. These letters were also sent to the
congressional committees of jurisdiction to inform their oversight.
We continue to collaborate with the Congress to revise or repeal
mandated reporting requirements to align our work with current
congressional priorities and maximize our staff resources.
internal improvements
Supporting Our People. The hard work and dedication of our diverse
and professional multidisciplinary staff positioned GAO to achieve 97
percent on-time delivery of our products in fiscal year 2018. We
exceeded the targets for our seven people measures, new hire rate,
retention rates with and without retirements, staff development, staff
utilization, effective leadership by supervisors, and organizational
climate. GAO also continued its distinction as a best place to work--
the Partnership for Public Service ranked GAO fourth among mid-size
Federal agencies and first for supporting diversity.
Managing Our Internal Operations. In fiscal year 2018, we continued
efforts to maximize our strategic goal to maximize our value by
enabling quality, timely service to the Congress and being a leading
practices Federal agency. We made progress addressing our three
internal management challenges: managing a quality workforce; improving
the efficiency of our engagements; and ensuring the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of GAO's information technology services.
We are on track to achieve 3,150 FTE in our fiscal year 2019 hiring
plan and expect to have over 3,250 staff on board at year-end.
In fiscal year 2018 GAO deployed the Electronic Protest Docketing
System (EPDS), made key security investments, and refreshed technology
platforms needed to support our bid protest work.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014, included a provision
for GAO to develop an electronic bid protest filing system. The statute
also authorized the collection and use of fees to offset the costs of
that system. GAO successfully piloted and launched its new system,
EPDS, in 2018.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As previously mentioned, in fiscal year 2019, we will complete the
pilot of New Blue, a system that will allow analysts to more
efficiently create and manage report content; streamline the publishing
processes; and enable access on mobile devices. New Blue is planned to
be rolled out across GAO following the conclusion of the pilot. If you
are interested in reviewing a GAO product in the new format, please see
GAO-18-312.
To enhance information technology services, we continued to
strengthen monitoring and detection of malicious activity to counter
escalating cybersecurity threats.
In keeping with our effort to continuously improve our operations,
GAO migrated to the Legislative Branch Financial Management System
(LBFMS) Momentum Financial operated by the Library of Congress. The
system serves as our integrated Financial Management System and is
hosted in a FedRAMP compliant and secure facility. LBFMS improved
internal controls over invoicing processing, reduced data entry errors,
and increased efficiency and timeliness of payments.
GAO also received an unmodified or ``clean'' opinion from
independent auditors on our financial statements for fiscal year 2018
and our internal control over financial reporting. Independent auditors
found no reportable noncompliance with provisions of applicable laws,
regulations, contracts, and grant agreements tested. We demonstrated
that all detailed performance and financial information is complete and
reliable and meets high standards for accuracy and transparency.
good accounting obligation in government act reporting
With regard to the recommendations from GAO's Office of the
Inspector General (OIG), GAO has implemented all of the recommendations
issued by the OIG prior to January 2018. Additionally, GAO has
determined that it will implement the three open OIG recommendations
that have been issued within the past 12 months and expects that
implementation will be completed within calendar year 2019.
legal work
In fiscal year 2018, we addressed about 2,600 bid protest cases and
issued more than 600 decisions on the merits. In addition, we published
15 appropriations law products, including five products to carry out
GAO's responsibilities under the Impoundment Control Act regarding the
President's special message of May 2018.
strategic planning
GAO issued its latest Strategic Plan for Serving the Congress and
the Nation in February 2018, covering fiscal years 2018 to 2023. As the
Nation confronts a series of both new and long-standing challenges,
this plan describes our goals and strategies to support the Congress to
identify cost savings and other financial opportunities; to make
government more accountable, efficient and effective; and ultimately to
improve the safety, security, and well-being of the American people.
GAO's Strategic Plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for how the
agency will support the most important priorities of Congress and the
American people.
This plan reflects the full scope of the Federal Government's
operations, as well as emerging and future trends that may affect
government and society. As part of our strategic planning process, we
emphasize foresight, continuous environmental scanning, and trend
analysis as essential to helping inform our decisionmaking and long-
term planning.
The plan is comprised of three sections: strategic goals and
objectives; key efforts; and trends that provide overall context
supporting our long- range planning. The current strategic plan
framework (Enclosure III) summarizes these global trends affecting
government and society, as well as the strategic goals and objectives
that guide our work.
There are eight trend areas in GAO's 2018--2023 plan including:
1.
Domestic and Global Security: Global conditions affecting U.S.
and international security;
2.
Fiscal Outlook and the Debt: The Federal Government's long-term
unsustainable fiscal path;
3.
Economics and Trade: Global response to challenges posed by
divergent economic growth;
4.
Jobs and Education: Technological advances and their impact on
preparing the workforce of the future;
5.
Demographics and Society: Demographic changes and their
implications for U.S. society and economy;
6.
Science and Technology: Five emerging technologies and
scientific advances that could potentially transform society (Genome
Editing; Artificial Intelligence and Automation; Quantum Information
Science; Brain/Augmented Reality; and Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain);
7.
Government and Governance: Increasingly complex governance
relationships and practices; and
8.
Environment and Sustainability: Balancing competing natural
resource and sustainability needs.
center for audit excellence
The Congress authorized GAO to establish a Center for Audit
Excellence (the Center) in 2014 to provide training and technical
assistance to enhance the capacity of domestic and international
accountability organizations. GAO contributes to a number of efforts
that promote good governance and enhance the capacity of the
accountability community. The Center uniquely offers a wide range of
training and technical assistance services at locations throughout the
United States and the world. The Center is authorized to charge fees
for its services to facilitate recovery of its costs.
Since its opening in October 2015, the Center has expanded its
volume of business significantly and increased annual revenue from
$41,000 in fees in fiscal year 2016 to $624,000 in fiscal year 2018.
Further, the Center has provided training or technical assistance
services to over two dozen Federal, State, local and international
accountability organizations. Several of these organizations have
returned to the Center repeatedly for training and technical assistance
services to help build staff capacity in applying auditing concepts and
tools.
In fiscal year 2018, the Center provided training and technical
assistance to 12 domestic audit organizations, including Federal
inspectors general and State and local audit offices. Center services
helped these organizations improve their staff members' understanding
of Federal internal control standards, Government Auditing Standards,
and performance audit methodologies. For example, the Center provided
10 classes on internal control to one Federal audit organization. Based
on formal and informal feedback, the vast majority of training
participants found Center training to be greatly useful.
The Center also provided technical assistance to three national
audit institutions in Europe and Central America during fiscal year
2018 to enhance their capacity to conduct and achieve results from
performance audits. For example, the Center helped a national audit
institution in Eastern Europe enhance its capacity to conduct
information technology audits and helped another national audit
institution assess and improve its process for documenting financial
benefits resulting from audits. The Center also provided technical
assistance on a project funded by the Millennium Challenge Corporation
to help enhance the performance audit capacity of a national audit
institution in Central America.
In April 2016, the Center signed a Memorandum of Understanding
(MOU) with the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to
collaborate in enhancing audit capacity and accountability in
developing countries. In fiscal year 2018, under the MOU, the Center
assessed the capacity building needs of an African country's audit
institutions for USAID and identified areas for improvement. In
November 2018, the Center signed an agreement with USAID/Philippines to
provide training and technical assistance services to the Philippine
Commission on Audit to strengthen their capacity to conduct performance
audits. USAID expects the total estimated cost of the 3-year project to
be $1.48 million and has obligated $500,000 for services to be provided
by the Center in the first year.
The Center continues to implement its business plan and look for
additional ways to build on its accomplishments and strengthen the
capacity of accountability partners to enhance the oversight of U.S.
Federal funds used domestically and across the globe. For example,
during fiscal year 2019, the Center plans to expand its international
work further by leveraging its MOU with USAID and expanding
partnerships with other organizations such as the World Bank.
concluding remarks
We value the opportunity to provide Congress and the Nation with
timely, insightful analysis on the challenges facing the country. I
would like to thank the Committee again for its support of GAO and the
fiscal year 2019 budget. Our fiscal year 2020 budget requests the
resources to ensure that we can continue to address the highest
priorities of the Congress.
Our request will allow us to continue building our staffing level
and provide our employees with the appropriate resources and support
needed to serve the Congress effectively. This funding level will also
allow us to continue efforts to promote operational efficiency and
address long-deferred information technology investments and
maintenance. We will also continue to explore opportunities to generate
revenue to help offset our costs.
I appreciate, as always, your careful consideration of GAO's budget
and your continued support.

[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]

Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you very much.
Dr. Hall, we would love to hear your opening statement as
well.
STATEMENT OF DR. KEITH HALL, DIRECTOR, CONGRESSIONAL
BUDGET OFFICE
Dr. Hall. Chairman Hyde-Smith and Ranking Member Murphy and
Members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to
present the Congressional Budget Office's budget request. And
thank you also for your longstanding support of CBO. That
support has allowed us to provide budgetary and economic
analysis that is timely, thoughtful, and nonpartisan as the
Congress addresses issues of critical importance.
The primary purpose of my testimony this morning is to
request an appropriation of $53.6 million for 2020. That amount
is an increase of $2.8 million, or 5.6 percent, from the amount
provided in 2019. That increase is largely aimed at
accomplishing two main goals.
1. BOLSTERING RESPONSIVENESS AND TRANSPARENCY
Last year, the Congress increased CBO's budget to put in
place a multiyear plan to increase our capacity to make its
work as transparent and responsive as possible. As a result, we
are increasing staffing in high-demand areas, such as analyses
of healthcare and immigration. In addition, we are continuing
to hire analysts to expand our use of team approaches, in which
work on large and complicated projects is shared.
In 2020, we propose hiring additional staff who would
increase our expertise and modeling capability in several
areas. CBO's goal is to have more staff with overlapping skills
within and across teams. In some cases, those skills will
consist of expertise related to particular programs, such as
transportation. In other cases, they will be more technical,
such as the ability to design simulation models. Increasing the
number of staff with overlapping skills will allow us to be
more nimble when responding to requests for information.
Building on the strong foundation we have established over
many years, and with added resources, CBO will also undertake
many different activities to make its analysis transparent. For
example, during the next 2 years, we will:
--Testify about our projections and analytical method and
will work to resolve issues raised by Congress;
--Publish more overviews and documentation of some of our
major models and more detailed information, including
computer code, about key aspects of those models;
--Release data in many forms, including an interactive
product to help users obtain information about our
estimates of the distribution of household income;
--Use a new format for our cost estimates to highlight key
parameters as well as information needed by the
Congress for budget enforcement procedures;
--Continue to evaluate previous estimates, when possible, in
order to improve future ones;
--Publish several reports about uncertainty in our estimates;
--Experiment with creating visual summaries of some of our
major reports, as we did in our most recent budget
outlook report; and
--Interact daily with the Congress to explain our estimates
and obtain feedback and continue to regularly obtain
advice from outside experts.
2. CONTINUE OUR HIGH VOLUME OF OUTPUT
In 2018, we published more than 900 formal cost estimates;
we complete cost estimates for nearly all bills before a floor
vote occurs. We also provided the Appropriations Committee with
numerous summaries and account-level tabulations for
appropriation bills; provided technical assistance to
congressional staff as they developed thousands of legislative
proposals and amendments; and published many reports about the
budget, the economy, and related issues.
Those reports included our assessment of the 10-year budget
and economic outlook, a report on the longer term budget
outlook, analysis of the President's budget, a 300-page report
describing more than 100 options for reducing the Federal
deficit, monthly budget reviews, and a variety of analytic
reports that examined particular Federal spending programs,
aspects of the tax code, and budgetary and economic challenges.
Most of those reports are written at the request of the
Chairman or Ranking Member of a committee or subcommittee or at
the request of the leadership of either party in the House or
Senate.
But we know that Members would like us to do even more. So
to achieve our two goals--to continue a high level of output
and bolster responsiveness and transparency--CBO requests an
increase of $2.8 million.
About $1.5 million--a little more than half of the proposed
increase would go toward funding for a full year 14 additional
staff members we will be hiring during fiscal year 2019, as
well as 6 additional hires in fiscal year 2020. That would
boost our total FTEs from 255 planned for this year to 264 next
year. The other $1.3 million would cover a small increase in
our employees' average salary and benefits to provide merit
based pay raises and keep pace with inflation.
With your support, we look forward to continuing to provide
timely and high-quality analysis to Congress. I'm very happy to
take your questions.
[The statement follows:]
Prepared Statement of Dr. Keith Hall
(See
in its original format the full report ``Testimony, CBO's
Appropriation Request for Fiscal Year 2020'' and statement of Keith
Hall, Director, in Appendix B at the end of the hearing.)
Chairman Hyde-Smith, Ranking Member Murphy, and Members of the
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to present the
Congressional Budget Office's budget request. And thank you also for
your long-standing support of CBO. That support has allowed CBO to
provide budgetary and economic analysis that is timely, thoughtful, and
nonpartisan as the Congress addresses issues of critical importance.
CBO is asking for appropriations of $53.6 million for fiscal year
2020. That amount represents an increase of $2.8 million, or 5.6
percent, from the $50.7 million provided to CBO for 2019. Of the total
amount, nearly 91 percent would be used for personnel costs.
reasons for the requested increase in funding
CBO requests an increase of $2.8 million for two priorities--to pay
for current staffing and to bolster transparency and responsiveness.
Last year, the Congress increased CBO's budget to put in place a
multiyear plan to increase the agency's capacity to make its work as
transparent and responsive as possible, and the increase requested now
would allow the agency to continue to pursue that plan.
Paying for Current Staffing
CBO requests an increase of $1.3 million to fund current staffing
levels in 2020. That amount would be used for a small increase in
employees' average salary and benefits to provide merit-based pay
raises and keep pace with inflation.
Bolstering Transparency and Responsiveness
The increase would include $1.2 million to fully fund 14 staff
members hired throughout fiscal year 2019. (The addition in terms of
full-time-equivalent positions, or FTEs, would be 7.6.) The increase
would also include $0.3 million for 6 new hires in fiscal year 2020.
(The addition in terms of FTEs would be 1.4.)
cbo's budget request and its consequences for staffing and output
In fiscal year 2020, CBO will continue its mission of providing
objective, insightful, clearly presented, and timely budgetary and
economic information to the Congress. To fulfill that mission, CBO
requests $53.6 million in funding. The requested funds would be used
for personnel costs (that is, salaries and benefits), information
technology (IT), and other costs, such as training.
Funding Request for Personnel Costs and Consequences for Staffing
CBO requests $48.7 million for salary and benefits. Those funds
would support 264 FTEs. The requested amount represents an increase of
$2.8 million, or 6.1 percent, from the amount provided for 2019. Of the
total requested amount:
--$36.5 million would cover salaries for personnel--an increase of
$2.3 million, or 6.7 percent, from the amount that will be
spent in fiscal year 2019. The increase would include $0.9
million in pay to fully fund the 14 staff members hired in 2019
and $0.2 million for the 6 new hires. The increase would also
cover performance-based salary increases for current staff and
an across-the-board increase of 1.9 percent for employees
earning less than $100,000. And it would provide funds for 3
FTEs for CBO's intern program.
--$12.2 million would fund benefits for personnel--an increase of
$0.5 million, or 4.4 percent, from the amount projected to be
spent in 2019. The increase would cover a boost in the cost of
Federal benefits, fully fund benefits for the 14 staff members
hired in 2019, and pay for benefits for the 6 new staff
members.
Funding Request for Nonpersonnel Costs
CBO requests $4.9 million for costs other than personnel. Those
funds would cover current IT operations--such as software and hardware
maintenance, software development, purchases of commercial data,
communications, and equipment purchases--and would pay for travel,
training, interagency agreements, facilities support, printing and
editorial support, expert consultants, financial management auditing
support, interactive graphic tools, and subscriptions to library
services.
The requested amount is roughly unchanged from the amount that will
be spent in fiscal year 2019. That is the result of offsetting effects.
The 2020 amount is pushed up in relation to the 2019 amount mainly
because CBO plans to further develop tools to analyze and present data
and would need to purchase additional resources to support a larger
staff. But the 2020 amount is pushed down in relation to the 2019
amount mainly because CBO anticipates achieving efficiencies in its IT
operations and because costs in 2019 have been temporarily boosted by
onetime agencywide training.
Consequences for Output
The requested amount of funding would allow CBO to do the following
for the Congress:
--Provide roughly 700 formal cost estimates (and significantly more
than that number if legislative activity is as high as it was
in 2018, when CBO provided 947 estimates), most of which will
include not only estimates of Federal costs but also
assessments of the cost of mandates imposed on State, local,
and Tribal governments or the private sector;
--Fulfill thousands of requests for background information and
technical assistance, the demand for which is very high as
committees seek a clear picture of the budgetary impact of
proposals and variants of proposals before they formally
consider legislation;
--Produce about 150 scorekeeping tabulations, including account-level
detail for individual appropriation acts at all stages of the
legislative process, as well as summary tables showing the
status of discretionary appropriations (by appropriations
subcommittee) and running totals on a year-to-date basis; and
--Publish about 70 analytic reports and papers--generally required by
law or prepared in response to requests from the Chairmen and
Ranking Members of key committees--about the outlook for the
budget and the economy, major issues affecting that outlook
under current law, the budgetary effects of policy proposals
that could change the outlook, and a broad range of related
budget and economic topics in such areas as defense policy,
infrastructure, Social Security, and housing.
The agency would also continue to bolster its transparency and
responsiveness by increasing its staff's availability to meet surges in
demand and by dedicating more staff to creating publications that
explain and graphically illustrate CBO's work.
Despite high productivity by a dedicated staff, CBO expects that
the volume of estimates and other analyses will fall short of the
number of requests from committees and congressional leadership and
will fall considerably short of the number of requests from individual
Members. The demands on the agency remain intense and strain its
resources in many areas. For example, the workload associated with the
analysis of appropriations continues to be heavy. Also, over the past
year, CBO analyzed legislation related to financial reform, farm
programs, nutrition programs, housing assistance for veterans, pension
reform, disaster assistance, opioid abuse, and cybersecurity. CBO
regularly consults with committees and leadership to ensure that its
resources are focused on the work that is of highest priority to the
Congress.
transparency
CBO has always worked hard to make its analysis transparent, and
the agency anticipates that almost all of its current employees will
spend part of their time on such efforts. Moreover, CBO recently put in
place a plan to strengthen those efforts. The Congress increased CBO's
budget for 2019 in part to hire new staff to contribute to transparency
and bolster responsiveness. To enhance transparency, CBO plans to hire
10 staff members in 2019 and proposes to hire 6 more in 2020.
During the next 2 years, CBO will undertake many different
activities to make its analysis transparent.
Testifying and Publishing Answers to Questions
In 2019 and 2020, CBO expects to testify about its baseline
projections and other topics as requested by the Congress. That work
will involve presenting oral remarks, answering questions at the
hearings, and presenting written statements, as well as publishing
answers to Members' subsequent questions for the record. CBO will
continue to work to resolve issues raised as part of the oversight
provided by the budget committees and the Congress generally. In
addition, the agency expects that Members of Congress will ask other
questions to which it will provide published responses.
Explaining Analytical Methods
CBO plans to publish short reports providing general information to
help Members of Congress, their staff, and others better understand its
work. One such report will provide brief explanations of some important
concepts related to the Congressional budget process. For example, that
report will explain differences among authorizations, appropriations,
rescissions, and reappropriations. Another will explain the differences
between two types of estimates used for credit programs: estimates
prepared using the methodology specified in the Federal Credit Reform
Act, which applies to most Federal credit programs, and estimates
prepared on a fair-value basis, which incorporates market risk. And
another short report will explain key scorekeeping rules and how they
have been used in providing estimates for recent legislation.
CBO will publish a substantial amount of technical information
about updates to its health insurance simulation model (HISIM). CBO
also will provide technical information about several other methods
used to analyze the effects of Federal policies. In addition to
segments of computer code from HISIM, CBO plans to release some code
from other models.
Releasing Data
In 2019 and 2020, CBO will continue to publish extensive sets of
data in conjunction with its major recurring reports, including
detailed information on 10-year budget projections, historical budget
outcomes, 10-year projections for trust funds, revenue projections by
category, spending projections by budget account, tax parameters and
effective marginal tax rates on labor and capital, and 10-year
projections of economic variables, as well as data about the economy's
maximum sustainable output.
The agency will also provide details about baseline projections--
this year with more supporting spreadsheets--covering the following:
the Pell grant program, student loan programs, Medicare, the military
retirement program, the pension benefit guarantee program, the Social
Security Disability Insurance program, the Social Security Old-Age and
Survivors Insurance program, the trust funds for Social Security, child
nutrition programs, child support enforcement and collections, foster
care and adoption assistance programs, the Supplemental Nutrition
Assistance Program, the Supplemental Security Income program, the
Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, the unemployment
compensation program, the Department of Agriculture's mandatory farm
programs, Federal programs that guarantee mortgages, programs funded by
the Highway Trust Fund, benefits for veterans and military personnel
stemming from the Post-9/11 GI Bill, and veterans' disability
compensation and pension programs.
Other data will provide details about long-term budget projections,
projections underlying Social Security estimates, more than a thousand
expired or expiring authorizations of appropriations, and dozens of
Federal credit programs. When CBO analyzes the President's budget
request, it will post a set of files providing estimates of the
budgetary effects of specific proposals. Throughout the year, the
agency will post the data underlying the figures in various reports.
Analyzing the Accuracy of CBO's Estimates
In 2019 and 2020, CBO will release reports analyzing the accuracy
of its past projections of outlays, revenues, deficits, and debt. As
part of a continuing series of reports about the accuracy of its
previous cost estimates, CBO will reexamine its original estimates of
certain legislation. A report on the accuracy of CBO's economic
forecasts will be released. And CBO will publish comparisons of
previous projections of Federal subsidies for health insurance with
actual amounts.
Comparing Current Estimates With Previous Ones
In several of its recurring publications--reports about the budget
and economic outlook, Federal subsidies for health insurance, and the
long-term budget outlook--CBO will continue to explain the differences
between the current year's projections and those from the previous
year. In its cost estimates, CBO will continue to identify related
legislative provisions for which it has provided estimates in the
recent past and explain the extent to which the provisions and
estimates at hand are similar or different.
Comparing CBO's Estimates With Those of Other Organizations
The agency will continue to publish its regular comparisons of its
budget projections and the administration's and of its economic
projections and those of private forecasters and other government
agencies. And the agency will include comparisons of estimates in
various reports. In addition, when time does not allow for publication,
analysts will sometimes be able to discuss such comparisons with
congressional staff.
Estimating the Effects of Policy Alternatives
In 2019 and 2020, CBO will release new interactive products to help
users understand the effects of potential changes to Federal policies.
And reports on other topics will also illustrate the potential effects
of various policy proposals.
Characterizing Uncertainty Surrounding Estimates
CBO will update its interactive workbook showing how changes in
economic conditions might affect the Federal budget. Also, its reports
about the 10-year outlook for the budget and the economy, the long-term
outlook for the budget, and Federal subsidies for health insurance will
contain substantial discussions of uncertainty.
Creating Data Visualizations
In 2019 and 2020, CBO will provide information about its budget and
economic projections in slide decks and create infographics about
actual outlays and revenues. And the agency will continue to look for
opportunities to include graphics to enhance the explanations in some
cost estimates.
Conducting Outreach
CBO will continue to communicate every day with congressional staff
and others outside the agency to explain its findings and methods,
respond to questions, and obtain feedback. The agency's Director will
meet regularly with Members of Congress to do the same.
As the agency updates its health insurance model, it will continue
to discuss the development with representatives from the Congress,
Federal agencies, States, insurers, employers, doctors, hospitals, and
the general public. The agency will also obtain feedback from
researchers such as those on the technical review panel that it
established for HISIM.
After each set of baseline projections is published, CBO's staff
will meet with congressional staff to discuss the new projections and
answer questions.
CBO will continue to obtain input from its Panel of Economic
Advisers and Panel of Health Advisers. It will continue to turn to
other experts as well. For example, CBO will convene a recurring
meeting of crop insurance and commodity analysts to review the past
performance of the crop insurance program and commodity markets and to
discuss projections of future spending in those areas. Many reports
will benefit from written comments by outside experts on preliminary
versions. For some recurring reports produced on compressed timetables,
such as the one about CBO's long-term budget projections, the agency
will solicit comments on previous publications and selected technical
issues to incorporate improvements in future editions.
CBO's staff will give presentations on Capitol Hill--some in
collaboration with the Congressional Research Service--on its budget
and economic projections and on other topics. Those presentations will
allow CBO to explain its work and answer questions. The agency will
also give presentations about its findings and about work in progress
in a variety of venues to offer explanations and gather feedback. In
addition, CBO will use podcasts and blog posts to summarize and
highlight various issues.
responsiveness
One of CBO's highest priorities is responding to the Congress with
the information that it needs to legislate. That information takes a
variety of forms, ranging from formal cost estimates to background
information and technical assistance, and CBO tries to provide it when
it is most useful. For example, CBO completes nearly all cost estimates
before a floor vote on legislation.
In addition, the agency works to provide technical assistance,
reports, and other information to policymakers during earlier stages of
the legislative process.
The agency recently put in place a plan to strengthen its
responsiveness. For 2019, the Congress increased CBO's budget in part
to hire new staff to contribute to that effort. As a result, CBO is
increasing staffing in high-demand areas, such as analyses of
healthcare and immigration. In addition, the agency is continuing to
hire analysts to expand its use of team approaches, in which work on
large and complicated projects is shared.
The budgetary increase that CBO is requesting now would allow it to
continue such efforts while also enhancing transparency. In 2020, CBO
proposes hiring additional staff who would increase the agency's
expertise and modeling capability in several areas. CBO's goal is to
have more staff with overlapping skills within and across teams. In
some cases, those skills will consist of expertise related to
particular programs, such as transportation. In other cases, they will
be more technical, such as the ability to design simulation models.
Increasing the number of staff with overlapping skills will allow the
agency to be more nimble when responding to requests for information.
This testimony summarizes information in CBO's budget request for
fiscal year 2020, which was prepared by Mark Smith, with contributions
from Leigh Angres, Wendy Edelberg, Joseph E. Evans Jr., Theresa Gullo,
Deborah Kilroe, Jeffrey Kling, Cierra Liles, Benjamin Plotinsky, and
Stephanie Ruiz.
Mark Hadley reviewed the testimony, Benjamin Plotinsky edited it,

Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you.
PLANS FOR GAO'S SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS
Mr. Dodaro, in March, you provided the subcommittee with
your plan to expand the support you provide to Congress in the
areas of science and technology by creating the new Science
Technology Assessment and Analysis Division. Please tell us
about the plan for this new division and how that plan is
reflected in your budget request this year.
Mr. Dodaro. Yes. First, the new team has four lines of
effort. One is to do technology assessments for the Congress.
For example, we've done ones in the past on artificial
intelligence dealing with cybersecurity, transportation
systems, autonomous vehicles, and in the financial regulatory
areas. Some financial advisors are providing, through machine
learning, advice to people to make investment decisions.
We're doing one artificial intelligence review now on
healthcare in terms of how we can help advise and provide
assistance by analyzing patterns and provide advice to
physicians and others. Also, in the new 5G area there's a big
concern about the allocation of spectrum with 5G and the
implication it's going to have for commercial uses, Federal
domestic agencies, as well as defense.
We will continue to expand our work doing these technology
assessments for the Congress. In the past, based upon the
agreement we've had with the Appropriations Committee, we do
about two of these a year. We think we can do more with our
budget request for next year, and Congress has asked for more
of these technology assessments.
Second, we are looking at programs that have science and
technology implications in them. For example, the Congress is
investing over several hundred billions of dollars for
maintenance and modernization of our nuclear weapons systems.
Congress has asked GAO to look at that. The estimate to resolve
the hazardous waste that already exists for nuclear weapons is
estimated to be almost a half a trillion dollars right now.
We've looked at alternative ways of disposing of this waste
through new technology applications. We'll be able to meet the
demands of the Congress better and the priorities for all these
implications of technology.
Technology is pretty ubiquitous now in almost everything
that the Federal Government does. We'll be able to expand our
capabilities in that area and to look at cost estimates. For
example, on the nuclear submarine work I just mentioned, we're
able to identify the fact that the estimates are overly
optimistic based upon the methodology and the fact that the
people we have in these areas, that understand the technologies
and the costs is important.
We also do technology readiness assessments, that enable
GAO to advise the Congress before it approves new technology to
go into production, that the technologies aren't mature enough,
and that Congress should wait before making the investments
because if you don't, there will be costly modifications later
on. So with the expansion of our team in this area, we can help
Congress avoid spending billions of dollars that aren't going
to produce the technology everybody thought it was going to
produce.
Third, we want to expand the technical assistance that we
provide to the Congress on a short-term basis. This is if they
have questions, such as ``What's this new technology about?
What are the implications of it? What can be done in these
areas? What questions should we be asking? What research and
development should be done?'' We can expand our capabilities to
provide that type of advice, not only to committees, we have to
be in a position to give that advice to individual Members when
they request it. So the additional resources we're requesting
will help us expand that capability because all Members really
need to understand these issues and the implications of them on
policy decisions.
Finally we're going to create, with the new resources, an
innovation lab where we'll be able to test new audit
methodologies. For example, on blockchain technology, if the
government applies this widely, which a lot of people are
suggesting that they do, how would you audit it? How would you
make sure that it has the integrity everybody thinks it has?
The other area is the information technology and
cybersecurity area. We are inundated with requests to look at
cybersecurity implications of virtually all Federal programs
and activities, and protecting personally identifiable
information, healthcare records, and it goes on and on. We will
be in a better position to respond to congressional requests in
order to respond to these cybersecurity concerns. As I
mentioned in my opening statement, these issues will get more
complicated, not less, with artificial intelligence.
For example, we are moving to a new air traffic control
system that will be based on satellite information, not the
current radar-based closed system. Once you are open to that,
autonomous vehicles and a wide range of other things, anything
connected to the Internet is going to have, great benefits.
Obviously, it's also going to have a down side too, in terms of
being exploited. Last year we reported the Defense Department
wasn't paying enough attention to cybersecurity concerns in the
development of new weapons systems. So we've been asked to do
more work in that area.
Space is another area where the dominance in space will
determine our success not only commercially, but also from a
national defense standpoint. We have to make sure that our
assets in space are protected as well. These are the areas that
we'll be able to provide more advice to the Congress.
Senator Hyde-Smith. Thank you. How do you intend for this
division to be able to provide Congress with actionable
information to guide technology-related policy decisions?
Mr. Dodaro. Yes. We have been identifying the policy
implications of this area. We've outreached to a wide number of
people throughout the Congress, academia, others that are
interested in this area. One comment is that we should provide
more policy options for the Congress to consider in these
areas. So we'll be providing more of that type of information
when appropriate.
In the cybersecurity area, in the last several years, we've
made over 3,000 recommendations, 700 of them haven't been fully
implemented yet, which is a part of my concern. In the
cybersecurity area, we've made very specific recommendations,
many of which aren't available publicly because they would
expose vulnerabilities, but in the technology assessments, we
need to add and we'll be developing more policy options for the
Congress to consider in those areas.
For example, we did a technology assessment on
nanomanufacturing, nanotechnology. Here's an area Congress has
invested $18 billion in the National Nano Initiative to provide
more funding for research and development. What we found was
while that was being successful, there was no Federal
Government support for bringing those new technologies into the
marketplace as soon as possible. So you had a big spike in
research and development but a lot of these things weren't
taken into commercial applications quickly and actually
entering the economy and having as much benefit as possible. We
advise that that's an area that Congress ought to look at.
Other countries have more holistic policies to go from
research and development all the way through supporting items
to get to market. Now, we have a greater reliance on the
private sector, but there is no reason we couldn't have more
cooperation between the public sector and the private sector in
bringing these technologies into fruition from research all the
way to application. That's an area where we've made
recommendations in the past.
I'm particularly interested in artificial intelligence and
the work we're doing on quantum computing as well. This is an
area where we're in a race with our adversaries to be dominant
going forward. Clearly we need to take some additional actions
in those areas. I look forward to making recommendations to the
Congress in that area as well, particularly in the defense
realm and in some of the other areas.
UPDATE ON INCREASE TRANSPARENCY
Senator Hyde-Smith. All right.
Dr. Hall, in your time as Director of CBO, you've made
transparency a top priority of the agency, which has also been
a concern for this subcommittee. Will you please provide an
update on current efforts to increase transparency in fiscal
year 2019 and how you plan to continue that work in the coming
fiscal year?
Dr. Hall. Sure. Actually, we've already done quite--quite a
lot. At the end of last year we produced a report that had sort
of a long listing of some of the things that we've done and
what we plan on doing. But we've done--we've done a--published
more overviews and documentation of all our major models. We've
provided some detailed documentation. We've provided some
computer code on particular models where--where it made sense.
We've released data, increased our release of data, in many
forms. We've produced some interactive products. We have an
interactive product on force structure, we have an interactive
product on discretionary spending, and then something on the
economic outlook where you're allowed to sort of vary some of
the economic assumptions that we use for the budget, budget and
economic outlook.
We've changed the format of our cost estimates to try to
make them--to highlight the key parameters that are used in the
estimates and make it more useful for budgetary enforcement
process. We've done continued evaluation of our estimates.
We've published some reports about uncertainty. We're
experimenting with visual summaries of some of the major
reports, so we've actually gotten some really good feedback. We
did that, for example, in the most recent budget outlook. And
we continue to interact daily with Congress, so we get some
feedback about how these--how these transparency efforts are
working, how they're going over.
And we've also done some--some talking. You know, we've
done some--some presentations over at CRS about how we do
healthcare estimates and how we do some of the other estimates,
how we do economic estimates.
So we've done quite a lot and we have quite a lot planned
going forward.
ANY CHALLENGES INCREASING STAFF LEVELS
Senator Hyde-Smith. Fantastic. Just one other follow-up to
that, supporting the needs of Congress, including providing the
enhanced transparency you are talking about, has required
increases in human capital. Do you foresee any challenges with
continuing to increase your staff levels?
Dr. Hall. Well, that has gone--that has gone well. It's
gone very well, I think. We've increased our hiring and we've
managed to keep our hiring standards very high, so that part
has worked out. We've added people in a lot of different areas.
To be honest, one of the real challenges is we need a
little bit of a larger footprint, so we're--we're crowding
folks a little bit to bring--bring them on, but we're handling
that. And, of course, we have lots of data and we need
particular configurations to protect the data. But I'd say the
challenges have not been great, and we're--we're rising to the
challenges.
GAO'S DISASTER-RELATED WORK
Senator Hyde-Smith. Okay. Moving on to your disaster work,
Mr. Dodaro, GAO was provided $14 million in supplemental
funding to conduct oversight work on disasters which occurred
during calendar year 2017, which was a very busy year. How many
projects have you completed related to this disaster work?
Mr. Dodaro. We've issued 11 reports already. We have 25
other audits underway. We expect in the next 2 months, this
month and next month, to complete an additional six reports,
and before the August recess, another eight reports. So by the
end of August, we'll have issued 25 total reports on this
subject and still have work underway because there's a long
tail, as you know, to these recovery projects and activities,
particularly, in this case, in Puerto Rico and Texas and the
Virgin Islands and Florida as well.
VALUABLE GAO DISASTER-RELATED FINDINGS
Senator Hyde-Smith. Yes. It does seem to go on and on and
just compounded by other things as well.
What has been the most valuable finding, and how can we
improve the Federal response to disasters?
Mr. Dodaro. Two main themes have come out of this. One is
the importance of building resilience in at the beginning, and
the level of preparedness at the State, territorial, or local
level. In the 2017 situation where Florida was much more
prepared than Puerto Rico, for example, and so they had built
resilience in, they had changed their building codes, they had
better secured their sources of electricity, and Puerto Rico
really wasn't prepared in that area.
So lesson number one is it's important to take adaptation
measures and to build resilience into your building codes and
then in to all other decisions, such as the height of the
bridges, how you secure not only your electrical system but
your communication systems, et cetera.
Now, I was pleased to see, based in part on GAO's work last
year, the Congress passed the Disaster Recovery Reform Act,
which allows some of the money to be used for resilience
building and through funding allows the State and local levels
to bring up their codes to new international standards. The
National Building Sciences group recommends for every dollar
that you invest into resilience building, you will save $6.00
later. The same thing with building codes: investments pay off
later and you don't have as much damage to deal with.
Lesson number two is that there is a need to improve the
contracting process in this area. We have looked at the advance
contracts that are supposed to be in place so FEMA could move
quickly. We made a number of recommendations on how that could
be strengthened, and also contracting right after the events.
That last thing I would say is we made a recommendation to
the Congress related to the Community Development Block Grant
disaster component. That does not have a standard authorization
for the Congress to have a permanent program there. And what's
happened with Katrina, with Sandy, and now with these 2017
hurricanes, it takes HUD time to design new programs using the
Federal Register process. Programs with new rules and new
regulations and everything. So they don't have anything ready
to go. And if Congress is going to continue to use the
Community Development Block Grant program, which is helpful
because it covers things that aren't covered under other
Federal programs and allows for building for housing and
economic development, Congress should permanently authorize the
program that would enable HUD to move out on contracts more
quickly.
So those are some of the recommendations we have so far.
We'll have more in our upcoming reports.
FUTURE GAO DISASTER WORK
Senator Hyde-Smith. So have you received requests for
oversight work now on the 2018-2019-related disasters?
Mr. Dodaro. I think we will. Just in defense alone, for
example, the damage at Camp Lejeune from Hurricane Florence,
and Hurricane Michael in Florida, and the Panhandle for Tyndall
Air Force Base, each have damage estimates of over $3 billion
for those areas alone.
We have also received requests to deal with wildfires out
West, and that's part of what we're doing right now, and, we've
had historic flooding in the Midwest recently; I expect
requests. There is hardly a disaster that happens that GAO is
not immediately asked for assistance to find out what's going
on, and we have built quite an expertise in this area. We
appreciate the supplemental funds from the Congress. We've
spent half of the $14 million so far. We expect to spend the
rest of the money in fiscal year 2020. If we're going to do
more work in these other disasters, having additional funding
would be helpful.
Senator Hyde-Smith. As I said, we're between votes and
we've got 8 minutes left, but Senator Murphy is on his way
back----
Mr. Dodaro. Okay.
Senator Hyde-Smith [continuing]. So maybe we can swap out
and still make this work.
GAO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY NEEDS
One more question here. Part of your request includes
investments in information technology and infrastructure, but
of the $16.5 million increase, you request an additional $10
million specifically for GAO's IT needs. Tell us about what
this funding will provide and the need for these new
investments.
Mr. Dodaro. Yes. There are several that are really critical
to our operations. First has to do with the unified
communications technology. The phone system in the GAO building
is still a PBX analog system. I've already made arrangements to
have it retired to the Alexander Graham Bell Museum. We don't
have Voice over Internet Protocol and a digital approach. That
we're going to be able to do. We're going to go to Skype for
Business so we can have clear communications with people,
because we have people throughout the United States and people
on field visits all the time. This will enable a very mobile
workforce that we have to communicate better. So that's number
one.
Number two, it will help the Congress because we're moving
to produce all our reports in an HTML digital format that can
be read on any mobile device. We've already produced our first
pilots under this program, that's been very favorably received
by the Congress, because staff can have access at hearings in
supporting Members on the floor to any GAO product through this
method. We're rolling this out now based on a successful pilot.
Third is our document management approach. We generate lots
of analysis and information, and have to have it stored. Our
document management system dates back to the 1990s. We need a
new system that will enable us to store our documents and
retrieve them effectively. This will increase our efficiency
and effectiveness. Everybody wants things as fast as possible,
and this will enable us to speed up our analysis and the
production of our reports.
Senator Hyde-Smith. What would be the effect if you were
not to receive those funds for these initiatives this year?
Mr. Dodaro. We'll have to use some Band-Aids and go to the
first aid kit and limp along for a while, and it won't increase
our productivity.
EXPECTATION OF THE NEW HEALTH INSURANCE MODEL
Senator Hyde-Smith. Okay. Dr. Hall, I understand CBO is
currently working on updating its Health Insurance Simulation
model, which the agency uses for cost estimates related to all
healthcare legislation. What can we expect from the new model,
and how are you ensuring transparency through this process?
Dr. Hall. Well, we are just about to roll out the new
model. We're going to use it in our spring baseline, which is
early next month, so it--it's--it's in--it's in use at the
moment. We had a process for preparing the model that was--that
was rather thorough and very transparent. We--we had extensive
peer review. We had broad external validation. We made a lot of
presentations. It has been the most open and transparent
development of a model I've ever seen, by far. And we've gotten
very good reviews on doing it that way. And then ahead of the
release of the baseline, which is, again, coming up next month,
we've very shortly going to produce a slide deck that has the
model specifications, the key equations and parameters, make
those public. We're going to have additional documentation,
particularly describing the sources and preparation of input
data that's used in the simulation modeling. And then we're
going to offer access to the computer code that the model uses
to simulate certain decisions about insurance choices, in
particular, that that's underlying the baseline work. So a lot
of that is just on the verge of coming out, I would say.
ECONOMIC OUTLOOK--DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP
Senator Murphy [presiding]. The gavel has been handed over
here. So sorry--as I'm sure Senator Hyde-Smith mentioned, we're
in the middle of a vote, so I appreciate you allowing us to do
musical chairs here.
Let me actually start with you, Dr. Hall, for my questions.
I wanted to take advantage of the fact that I have you in front
of our subcommittee because I haven't gotten the chance to talk
to you about some of the recent economic outlooks that CBO has
put forward, and I just wanted to take advantage of the
opportunity to ask a few questions.
I think the latest one that I saw was your January update,
noted that deficits continue to rise, debt will achieve about
93 percent of GDP in 2029. Can you talk a little bit about what
is driving those historically high debt-to-GDP ratios, and
these growing deficits, and how you analyze the recent tax
reform bill as a component to debt and deficit numbers?
Dr. Hall. All right. Well, one of the things that we see
over the next several years is deficits of about 4 percent of
GDP going forward, which is a high level. It's especially a
high level when the economy is performing this well. One of the
points I like to make is last year we had pretty good economic
growth, 2.9 percent, the best since 2009, yet the deficit grew
to almost 4 percent of GDP. So deficit is pretty significant
now, and it's pretty significant during a time in the business
cycle where--where one could have a--should have a--well, I
don't want to use the word ``should''----
Senator Murphy. Right.
Dr. Hall [continuing]. But you could have a much lower
deficit, because one of the things that can happen going
forward is if we go through another cycle, deficits are going
to grow and they're--but they're going to grow from a very high
level. So we're almost at $1 trillion now, if we go through
another cycle--I'll give you a for-example, during the Great
Recession, the deficit was about $160 billion. In 4 years, it
climbed to $1.2 trillion. Well, right now it's going to start
at almost $1 trillion, and you go through another cycle, it's
going to go up way beyond that. So that's a real concern. It's
a concern over the time, again the timing of when things are
good.
But we see 4-percent deficits going straight through--
straight ahead. We do see the debt climbing, it's about 78
percent of GDP now, we do see it getting to be 93 percent of
GDP. Right now obviously spending outstrips revenues, and
that's--that continues going forward.
Part of why we think we're getting good growth right now is
the effects of the tax bill, it did have a stimulus effect, but
it's a stimulus effect, meaning that we'll have higher than
trend growth this year probably, and we had it last year, but
we think that's going to wear out, and growth is going to drop
to much lower levels in 2020, and we're going to get slower
growth, and that's going to mean--that's going to mean things
for the budget going forward, the deficits are going to grow
from there.
Senator Murphy. And, you know, part of the dispute over the
underlying deficit and debt impact of the tax bill was a
disagreement over what that rate of growth would be----
Dr. Hall. Mm-hmm.
FUTURE RATE OF GROWTH (1.7 PERCENT) AND PROJECTED LABOR SHORTAGE
Senator Murphy [continuing]. And it is interesting that
you're pegging growth at around 1.7 percent leading up to 2023.
And in that analysis, at least in the summary of your analysis,
you recognize--I don't want to put a phrase in your mouth--but
labor shortages, or a shrinking labor pool as contributory to
that relatively new to rate of growth compared to what we have
today. And I don't mean to bring politics into questioning you,
but the President has gotten a lot of attention recently
claiming that the country is full, and yet your analysis is
that a lack of labor is going to contribute to our inability to
eclipse 2-percent growth numbers.
Can you just sort of play out for us a little bit why that
is, explain why labor shortages, or lack of labor, leads to a
lower growth rate?
Dr. Hall. Sure. I'll start with history. When we were
achieving 3-percent growth a few decades ago, we had the labor
force growing 1.2, 1.4 percent a year. So we had baby boomers
in their prime, and we had women's labor force participation
climbing, and so closing the gap. Going forward, we see labor
force growth only being about half a percentage point.
So right away, if you go from 1.4-percent growth to 0.5-
percent growth, that's--that's a huge drag on the ability for
the economy to grow. So our forecast over the long run, we see
maybe productivity growth 1.3 percent, 1.4 percent, labor force
growth of .4 percent. You literally add those together and you
get that 1.7-, 1.8-percent growth, and that's where we see it,
and it's a--it's a supply-side limitation, and it's primarily
from a slower growing labor force than we've had in the past.
Senator Murphy. And you're already in an environment where
you have close to structurally low unemployment.
Dr. Hall. Right. In fact, we think unemployment is below
its structural level, so it's below a sustainable level, so we
think it's going to go back up in the next year or two.
Senator Murphy. So a lot of attention is to the number of
people who are outside the labor force, who aren't counted in
the reported percentage of individuals who are unemployed. If
some of those individuals were to rejoin the labor force, that
would, of course, change your dynamic about the effect of low
labor supply. Is there any reason to believe that the
individuals who have been permanently outside of the labor
force will come back in as you have other sources of new labor,
whether it be immigration or increases in women joining a labor
force fail to meet our needs?
Dr. Hall. Yes. Actually, I think we've already had pretty
good recovery----
Senator Murphy. Yes.
Dr. Hall [continuing]. From the Great Recession. I think
the number of people who have reentered the labor force has
maybe been a little stronger than we thought already going
forward. I don't know how much more one--one can expect from
that.
PROJECTED INCREASE IN REVENUE AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP (2029)
Senator Murphy. And then just lastly on the report, revenue
as a percentage of GDP, around 16.5 percent today, slowly
increases so that by 2029 you're back above 18 percent of GDP.
Explain why that happened. Explain why you have a consistent
increase in the percentage of revenue to GDP during that period
of time.
Dr. Hall. Well, there are two main reasons. One is under
current law, the reduction in tax rates, individual tax rates,
are going to go back up in 2025. So if those go back up, that
will--that will raise that. And the other thing is real bracket
creep. Typically GDP grows faster than inflation, and so more
people move up into higher tax brackets. So those are the two
things that we think under current law will raise the share of
revenue as a share of GDP back above historical levels.
Senator Murphy. And it's those individual tax reductions
that are the temporary.
Dr. Hall. Absolutely.
Senator Murphy. Right. The corporate tax cuts do not
expire.
Dr. Hall. That's right. In fact, both of those things I
mentioned are individual income tax increases.
Senator Murphy. Right. Thank you very much, Mr. Hall. The
last question for you--thank you for your answers to Senator
Hyde-Smith's question about transparency. You're really to be
applauded for how serious you've taken this issue. As we
discussed, there's a limit to how much transparency can be
provided, but you are delivering an extraordinary amount of
additional window into your work, and these interactive models
I think are really, really helpful to folks in our offices that
are working on these complicated issues.
IT INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS
And to that last question, are there IT infrastructure
needs, and I'm sorry if Senator Hyde-Smith asked this, that you
need to increase this commitment to transparency? Is it really
just a matter of sending staff on new missions and projects, or
is there an IT component to this that you're going to need
going forward?
Dr. Hall. I think a lot of it is just sending--sending our
staff on new missions to find things. And it's not just, you
know, a few people, it's all our analysts are now taking more
time to be more transparent, to document what they're doing
better, to get good ideas on known interactives and that sort
of thing.
We do have some plans on our IT. We've moving to the--we're
moving almost all our data center to the cloud, and we're
moving to virtual desktops, but that's just part of, I think,
being more efficient. We'll be fine with the transparency as
long as we get some--continue to have some resources.
Senator Murphy. And as long as you have the resources, you
don't see the additional transparency commitment taking away
from your workload and your responsiveness to requests.
Dr. Hall. No. And that was--that was the one thing that we
really insisted on, is our due diligence. The quality of our
work can't suffer from this, which is part of why we made a
real effort to shift resources around and ask for more
resources.
Senator Murphy. Great. Thank you very much, Dr. Hall.
MORE ON GAO'S DISASTER REPORTING
Good to see you, Mr. Dodaro. I only have a few questions
for you, but I wanted to focus them on the $14 million that you
were given to conduct oversight of the nearly $122 billion
provided in disaster relief for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands. Can you give us just a sense of the scope of this
project, the size and duration of the audit plan? Is it
happening now? If so, what do you have on the ground in terms
of audit and analysis resources?
Mr. Dodaro. We started shortly after the events occurred.
We've already issued 11 reports on the initial response of our
agencies, status of issues in Puerto Rico and the Virgin
Islands, for example; how the advance use of contracting was
used. We have 25 other audits underway. Of those, we expect to
complete six of them in the next 2 months, by April and May. We
also expect to complete eight others, additional ones, by the
August recess. By the August recess, we will have issued 25
reports.
Now, the scope of this covers over a dozen Federal agencies
that are providing support to the initial response and
recovery. We issued a report, for example, recently on the
Community Development Block Grant assistance. We'll look at the
SBA response. We'll look at DOD's role in the whole process,
Interior, Agriculture, in addition to the FEMA activities, and
a number of other agencies are involved as well. So what will
be the scope of our work, is really all the efforts, Federal
efforts, underway to help in the initial response and then
recovery.
Usually it takes a long time for these things to spend out.
Under CDBG, for example, the States and territories will have
up to 6 years to spend that money. Hurricane Sandy efforts are
just winding up in the last couple years as well.
So we plan to stay with it through the time Congress needs
oversight over the process.
GAO DISASTER FINDINGS SPECIFIC TO HUD
Senator Murphy. Congress provided HUD CDBG, you referenced
that program, with just short of $20 billion in funding for
Puerto Rico alone. Puerto Rico received the first infusion of
that money, about $1.5 billion, just 3 months ago. That's over
a year and a half after the storm, and HUD is sitting on the
balance of that money, $18.5 billion, and, as far as I know,
hasn't even posted anything in the Federal Register regarding
the $8.3 billion in HUD disaster mitigation so that people can
begin applying for those funds.
I think you mentioned that you've already done some
oversight here. Have you evaluated HUD's performance in
administering this disaster funding?
Mr. Dodaro. Yes, we have. A couple things we've suggested
there. Number one, we think Congress ought to give permanent
authorization to the HUD disaster assistance program. Right
now, there is no process, so HUD has to tailor the rules,
regulations, and programs to go through this process on each
disaster, and it's taken longer. They also had to do this on
Katrina. They had to do it on Superstorm Sandy. Now they're
doing it with the 2017 disasters. We have a chart in our report
that shows that it takes almost the better part of a year for
HUD to go through the process that they have in place. So we
recommend Congress, like in a lot of other Federal programs, to
give permanent authority so that the regulations and rules are
already in place, and so they can just start once Congress
appropriates the money.
Now, with regard to HUD itself, we found that they didn't
have good processes and procedures for reviewing the
applications from the States and territories. They could
strengthen their process in that area, and develop better
monitoring plans. They needed to think about the workforce that
they need to carry out these activities in a timely and
effective way. We made a number of recommendations to HUD as
well.
Now, with regard to Puerto Rico and spending the money,
what we found was that in Texas and Florida, they had only
spent about 1 percent of the money that was available for them.
That was mostly for administrative purposes. Puerto Rico and
the Virgin Islands hadn't spent anything yet because they
didn't have the same kind of infrastructure ready that Texas
and Florida had to spend the money.
So none of the States or territories that received money
under this program have spent any more than 1 percent of it as
of January this year. So Puerto Rico is no different than the
other States and territories.
Senator Murphy. I mean, you're certainly right that we
should have permanent authorization, but, you know, we're
already in the permanent business of providing disaster
assistance. HUD knows in any given year that it's going to be
responding to disasters somewhere with or without our permanent
reauthorization or authorization of that programming.
So, I mean, that doesn't sound like an excuse that should
be available to HUD given the fact that they know that they are
going to be annually in the business of getting this money out.
They could make reforms to expedite the funding notwithstanding
Congress's failure or success in permanently authorizing those
capabilities.
Mr. Dodaro. Yes, well, I'll go back. I'll give you a more
detailed answer for the record. But they can't spend money
unless Congress appropriates the money to have a program. I
mean, so they'd be having to use their authorities to create
something that Congress hasn't authorized them in advance. So I
think there's a legal issue limiting their ability to do what
you're suggesting and have it in place and go through the
process. But I'm not positive on that, and I will go back and
talk to our legal and programmatic teams and get you a more
detailed answer. But, you know, we--we've made that
recommendation.
We think Congress ought to give them the authority to
establish that program. I'm not suggesting Congress give them
funding in advance, I'm just saying that Congress ought to say
we authorize there to be a permanent program for disaster
recovery under the Community Development Block Grant program so
HUD has the--then the legal authority to create a permanent set
of rules and regulations that are in place.
Senator Murphy. And, lastly, President Trump has reportedly
been reluctant to deliver additional money to Puerto Rico, in
part, because of his claims that the government has acted
irresponsibly with respect to the money that they have already
been given. Based on your work, do you have any reason to
believe that Puerto Rico is spending Federal dollars it has
received irresponsibly? Have you found any evidence of fraud or
significant and unjustifiable waste in the dollars that have
been spent thus far?
Mr. Dodaro. Not yet. Actually, FEMA has in place manual
procedures to approve every reimbursement that goes to HUD. So
they have pretty strict controls in place right now. They're
waiting for Puerto Rico to come up with an internal control
plan that they'll produce that will give Puerto Rico more
ability to operate on their own without FEMA having to approve
manually every reimbursement of the money that they spent in
that area.
So, so far, it looks like there are stringent controls in
place, but as Puerto Rico gets more authority to operate on
their own, they--they've established a new office, they're in
the process of developing their procedures, and so--but--and
we'll--we're going to continue to monitor this, but so far it
looks like FEMA has acted responsibly and have good controls in
place over the money that's spent in Puerto Rico.
Senator Murphy. And Puerto Rico has----
Mr. Dodaro. Yes.
Senator Murphy [continuing]. Acted responsibly.
Mr. Dodaro. Well we haven't fully examined what Puerto Rico
has done yet, but it--they have to get reimbursement from FEMA.
So the real check is they have to provide documentation to
FEMA, and so FEMA--to approve to get the money. So they really
can't operate on their own very much without getting
reimbursement without FEMA operating in that area.
Senator Murphy. Right.
Mr. Dodaro. So I think basically what we've seen is that
the structure of a responsible approach is being put in place.
Senator Murphy. Great. Thank you very much.
Senator Lankford.
MORE COLLABORATION BETWEEN CBO AND GAO
Senator Lankford. Thanks.
Gentlemen, thanks again. I apologize, I'm running back and
forth between votes and other hearings, and I'm not getting a
chance to be able to get all of the dialogue today back and
forth. I want to be able to go through a couple things.
Both of you the last couple of years have asked for
additional staffing, reasonably so, on some of the issues
you've dealt with and some of the expansion of issues that are
still to come on cyber, science and all those things. Help me
understand this. How can the two teams work together more
collaboratively when there's a surge moment?
Dr. Hall, you had a moment where you were dealing with
healthcare issues, and you needed a surge of staff. Gene Dodaro
has a bunch of healthcare folks on his team as well. Now,
they're not economists, they're not used to doing the same
thing, but is there a way that we can plan together when we
have two teams of folks giving us oversight and giving us
analysis of different pieces of legislation that we can
actually put a process in place to be able to have at moments
some cooperation between the two groups, though they have
uniquely different functions? Is there a way to do that that
you could see?
Dr. Hall. That's something we haven't thought about much,
in part because, you know, people aren't terribly fungible. You
have to have people who are--who are experts in an area.
Senator Lankford. Right, but in surge moments.
Dr. Hall. In surge moments, we already try to do more with
that in terms of research assistance. We did--we threw a lot of
people at it. Whether we could find expertise at GAO, you know,
I don't know. We'd have to talk with them a little bit about
that.
Senator Lankford. Okay.
Mr. Dodaro. Yes, Keith is right. We really haven't explored
that issue. But what I would say for----
Senator Lankford. Sure. You should ask for a GAO report on
that.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Dodaro. But I'm happy to have a discussion with Keith
and see if there are some possibilities there.
Senator Lankford. Yes.
Mr. Dodaro. But the point I would make, though, is that,
and I'm not speaking for Keith, but just for GAO, we're already
oversubscribed----
Senator Lankford. Right.
Mr. Dodaro [continuing]. So whatever we do we hit peak
periods, too----
Senator Lankford. Right.
Mr. Dodaro [continuing]. We work with the committees to
discuss trade offs, ``Okay, if we do this work for you, we're
not going to do this other work for several months.'' So
whatever we do might help in the immediate, but it's going to
have consequences to other support for the Congress.
TRANSPARENCY--INSIGHTS INTO CBO'S MODELS
Senator Lankford. Well, we ask a lot, as a Congress, of
both of you, and there reaches a moment that we're overasking.
That's why you're going through committee Chairs and Ranking
Members to be able to say, ``Okay, do you really need this?''
because we've got to be able to figure out how to prioritize
things.
It's entirely reasonable for both of you to be able to work
through that process so people don't overask. But also at some
point we've got to be able to find a moment to say, ``Is there
more cooperation that we can do together?'' because, Dr. Hall,
your peak periods are different than GAO's peak periods on a
different issue, and there may be some cooperation that we
haven't explored together. So I'll just leave that out as an
idea. I don't anticipate including that as a report document,
but I would like to be able to at least broach that and say
let's consider that.
Dr. Hall, you've done a lot of work, and we've had, in
previous documents from Appropriations, some additional
requests, and you have even worked with our team to be able to
add more information about how models are done, how analytics
are done. Your information that you've sent up to us for
appropriations continues to include more viewing into the black
box basically and how these things are done with statistics and
background.
Tell me how that's moving in a time period that we can see
that because the modeling of this is extremely important. As
you know, with any scientific model, having other folks run
numbers in the same model is exceptionally helpful, and then to
be able to ask, ``What are the variables in that model?'' to be
able to look at it and say, ``Did you consider this?''
Dr. Hall. Sure.
Senator Lankford. Right now, we're not able to ask the
reasonable question, ``Was this considered?'' And so for any of
us to turn in any piece of legislation, we always wonder,
``Where did that number come from?''
Dr. Hall. Sure. Well, we're doing--we are already doing a
lot of things. We've already done quite a lot. We've tried to
increase transparency in many ways, and we're trying to make
good business decisions on how we do it, and what drives the
most is what's most helpful to Congress, what's something we
can do? And that can be everything from better documentation to
spelling out key variables, that sort of thing.
There's a little bit of a focus--a bit of a focus on-- on
modeling code, and we can try to do that some, but the only
thing I would again caution on this--I've talked about this a
bit--models are tools that analysts use.
Senator Lankford. Right.
Dr. Hall. Right? And so more than anything else, you need
an analyst who does his or her work carefully, considers a lot
of things, uses the model appropriately if there's a model
involved. So there's a lot more besides just the model.
We've done a lot of things, and we'd love to get some
feedback on what's working, what you find helpful, what you
don't find helpful. One of things I think we've done
intentionally is we've cast a very broad net on ways to be
transparent, and we're waiting to see what works.
Senator Lankford. Right.
Dr. Hall. And getting some feedback on that would be great
because we still have a commitment to being more transparent.
REPORT COMPARING PREVIOUS ESTIMATES ON PROGRAMS
Senator Lankford. Yes. One of the things that you've
included in your notes to us is your own requirement and
deadline you're going to put together to be able to create a
report to look at previous estimates on programs, on what you
are expecting in deficit spending, whatever it may be, to look
at, here's what we looked at in 2015, 2005, 2019, let's compare
it to where we were same time, same period, to be able to help
evaluate that.
Dr. Hall. Right.
Senator Lankford. That would be helpful to us, and because
we're trying to be able to make decisions based on your
estimates, and for you to be able to say, ``Here's our
variabilities as well.'' As we go through this, economists are
never going to get it 100 percent right except for the
economist that wrote it after it was over. So to be able to--
anyone that's looking in the future to help us understand, ``We
think our margin of error is historically somewhere through
here,'' would help us tremendously.
The challenge that we have--Chris and I would never do
this, but there are other Members of the Senate that when they
know they want a certain bill that's really in the jurisdiction
of a different committee, but I'm not on that committee, so I'm
going to write it in such a way that it lands in my committee,
not in that one.
Now, again, the two Senators present, clearly we would
never do that, but the reason I bring that up is once your
model comes out and once the details are out, there will be
Members of the House and the Senate that will do gymnastics to
be able to write whatever it is, not for best legislative texts
or long term, but best possible score coming from CBO. We're
going to have to figure this out because the models are
exceptionally important so that we know what the variables are
we're dealing with, but we've got to be able to figure out how
to be able to manage this so we don't have legislative Jiu-
Jitsu to be able to write something that's not best text, but
best for you, because at the end of the day it's going to be
best for the American people, not best for CBO, but our
scorekeeper is you. So if we don't get through you first, it
never gets to the American people. Do you see what I mean?
Dr. Hall. Sure. And let me say, we've actually--we've
really done a lot. We've got a pretty significant report at the
end of last year of the number of things that we've done, and
we do--we do, do a lot of self-assessment. We've actually--
actually done that. We have--we do give you some idea how--what
our error is. A year before I can tell you, a year ahead our
typical revenue estimate is off by 1.5 to 2 percent.
Senator Lankford. Right.
Dr. Hall. And the outlays are something--something like the
same. So we've got that process actually going where we're
doing it annually. For every year, we're now going to look back
to the prior year and produce a public report, and we did this
year, as a matter of fact, of exactly how we did the prior
year.
And one of the things I think is particularly challenging,
and I think part of what you have in mind, is on individual
scores, individual pieces of legislation, and that's really
challenging often because knowing the effect of the legislation
can be really difficult because the data gets mixed in with
other accounts, and it can be really hard to sort that out.
Senator Lankford. Right.
Dr. Hall. So what we're trying to do is we've done a couple
of those now, is we're looking for instances to do those again
where the data is available to give you an idea on the expected
area and particular estimates, particularly pieces of
legislation.
And something else that probably should help is we're
trying really hard to have a section on uncertainty in our
estimates. We've redesigned our cost estimate format, and we
set it up so it's more transparent, but there is now an
uncertainty part of that. To try to give you the degree, we can
tell you how uncertain our estimate is, we're going to try to
tell you there.
Senator Lankford. Yes.
Dr. Hall. We're always hindered by the unknown unknowns, so
sometimes it's qualitative rather than quantitative.
Senator Lankford. Yes. Only God doesn't have unknowns, and
so we all deal with that, and I get that. But that's helpful
for us in our dialogue because at times, and both sides of the
aisle do it, they look at what you put out and say that's
exactly what it's going to be, and you and all of your team
know it's not exactly what it's going to be, it's our best
guess----
Dr. Hall. Right.
Senator Lankford [continuing]. As we go through this. And
so to know some of the variables as we work through it would be
exceptionally helpful. The more transparent you can build the
process, the more it gets us good information to be able to
work through the process as well.
Dr. Hall. Good.
Senator Lankford. I appreciate that very much. Give us the
time period you're thinking of for some of these reports. You
list in your information that you're going to release the
estimates as you listed the analyzing accuracy of CBO estimates
and some reports on that.
Dr. Hall. Well, we've already produced some of those.
Senator Lankford. Right.
Dr. Hall. I'd be glad to follow up and point you to some of
those and give you some idea of how we're going to repeat those
over time.
Senator Lankford. Okay. Spacewise, let me ask one question,
Gene, on your own space. Do you have the appropriate space and
the footprint in the building you're in as far as leased out
space, space for your folks? Any changes that you need?
Mr. Dodaro. We're in good shape in space in our building.
Actually, we're leasing out the third floor, most of the sixth
floor now, not only to the Army Corps of Engineers
headquarters, but also to units from the Justice Department as
well to increase our revenue. I mean, that's----
Senator Lankford. Right. I knew that was coming.
Mr. Dodaro. Yes.
Senator Lankford. I just didn't know how that's working
out.
Mr. Dodaro. It's working out fine. What we did was we hired
an architect to redesign and make better use of the space. It's
a big building.
Senator Lankford. You couldn't get the Army Corps to do
that for you since they're moving in?
Mr. Dodaro. Well, we thought there would be a conflict
there.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Dodaro. That's working out very well. It's producing
the revenue. We have enough space. We're allowing our people
more telework options, and they don't need the same degree of
space in headquarters.
We've reduced our footprint in the field about 40 percent.
There we have to lease from GSA, so we've avoided millions of
dollars in rent increases in that area. I was just in Boston
earlier this week in our field office there, and they've got
nice space in the Tip O'Neill Federal Building. They're happy
there because they have child care and everything available to
them right in that facility.
Senator Lankford. That's great. Okay. Thank you.
Chris, thanks for letting me slip in.
Senator Murphy. Thank you very much. Absolutely.
