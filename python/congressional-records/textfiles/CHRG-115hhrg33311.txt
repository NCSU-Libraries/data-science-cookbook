WEDNESDAY, JULY 25, 2018
House of Representatives,
Committee on House Administration,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 11:24 a.m., in Room

[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Harper, Comstock, Walker, Smith,

The Chairman. I call to order the Committee on House
Administration for today's Committee markup. A quorum is
present, so we may proceed.
The meeting record will remain open for 5 legislative days
so Members may submit any materials they wish to be included
therein.
[The information follows:]
The Chairman. We are here today to formally approve
Committee Resolution 115-20 to update the townhall meeting
regulations found in the Members' Congressional Handbook.
The current handbook regulations allows Members of the
House to co-host in-person townhall meetings with Members
representing adjacent congressional districts. This handbook
update will allow Members of the House to co-host telephone and
internet or virtual townhall meetings with another Member even
if the congressional districts are not adjacent.
This update will offer additional flexibility to Members
when communicating with their constituents via virtual townhall
meetings.
I would now like to recognize the Ranking Member, Mr.
Brady, for the purpose of providing an opening statement if he
desires.
Mr. Brady. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Chairman, I support the Committee resolution before us
today. This change to our Members' handbook will allow Members
to communicate with their constituents about regional issues,
allowing constituents more meaningful access to their
government. I appreciate the bipartisan work in developing this
proposal, and I urge my colleagues to support it.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.
The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Brady.
I would ask if any other Member of the Committee wishes to
be recognized for the purpose of providing an opening
statement.
Ms. Lofgren. Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. I recognize the gentlewoman from California.
Ms. Lofgren. I don't have an opening statement, but I just
wanted to clarify--I think it is permitted, but I wanted to get
it on the record--that you could have more than one adjacent
Member.
For example, I had a townhall meeting once where there were
three Members who were adjacent to each other on a topic, held
at the county, you know, board chambers.
So this is not restricted to two if there are--in an urban
area, for example, there are oftentimes more than two who are
adjacent.
And, with that clarification, I would yield back.
The Chairman. The Chair would agree with that
interpretation. As long as they are adjacent, it can be more
than two.
Ms. Lofgren. Thank you.
The Chairman. Anyone else?
I now call up and lay before the Committee Resolution 115-
20 to prove the update to the Members' Congressional Handbook.
Without objection, the first reading of the resolution is
dispensed with, and the resolution is considered read and open
for amendment at any point.
[The resolution follows:]
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
The Chairman. Is there any debate?
Are there any Members who wish to offer an amendment to the
resolution?
If not, I move the Committee adopt the resolution.
The question is on the motion.
All those in favor, signify by saying aye.
Opposed, say nay.
In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes have it, and the
motion is agreed to.
Without objection, the motion to reconsider is laid upon
the table.
Without objection, the markup is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 11:27 a.m., the Committee was adjourned.]
