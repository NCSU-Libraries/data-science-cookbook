MARKUP OF COMMITTEE RESOLUTIONS 115-6, 115-7, AND 115-8
----------
TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2018
House of Representatives,
Committee on House Administration,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 2:25 p.m., in Room
1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Gregg Harper
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Harper, Davis, Comstock,
Loudermilk, and Brady.
Staff Present: Sean Moran, Staff Director; Kim Betz, Deputy
Staff Director; Cole Felder, Deputy General Counsel; Dan
Jarrell, Legislative Clerk; Amanda Anger, Professional Staff;
Erin McCracken, Communications Director; Jamie Fleet, Minority
Staff Director; and Eddie Flaherty, Minority Chief Clerk.
The Chairman. I now call to order the Committee on House
Administration for today's Committee meeting. A quorum is
present, so we may proceed. The meeting record will remain open
for 5 legislative days so that Members may submit any materials
that they wish to be included therein.
There are three items that we have on the docket today:
First, Committee Resolution 115-6, the Committee's views and
estimates on the fiscal year 2019; second, we have Committee
Resolution 115-7, a measure to amend the regulations
collectively known as the Members' Congressional Handbook; and,
third, Committee Resolution 115-8, a measure to amend the
regulations collectively known as the Committee Congressional
Handbook.
The first item before us is Committee Resolution 115-6, the
Committee's views and estimates for fiscal year 2019. The
Congressional Budget Act of 1974 requires Congressional
Committees to submit to the Committee on the Budget their views
and estimates on programs within their jurisdictions.
The views and estimates we are making up today highlight
the Committee's continued work to conduct oversight and
identify future potential savings at the Federal Election
Commission. As the Committee has stated previously, one way to
reduce the FEC's budget is to eliminate the Presidential
Election Campaign Fund. The Committee continues that
recommendation. In addition, the views and estimates highlight
the ongoing concerns the Committee has with the Election
Assistance Commission.
The views and estimates reflect the Committee's support for
the ongoing efforts to strengthen the cybersecurity platforms
within each of the legislative branch entities and agencies.
Equally important, the Committee supports the ongoing efforts
in the House to ensure it has the resources and assistance in
the event of a cyber attack.
Furthermore, the views and estimates recognize the
importance of providing resources to address the issue of
sexual harassment. As I have said previously, one case of
sexual harassment is one too many. We need to ensure that the
House's training program, which will begin this April, is
effective in educating and preventing discrimination and
harassment.
Finally, the views and estimates recognize the ongoing need
to secure and protect Members, their staffs, their
constituents, and, of course, the public. The events in the
summer of 2017 and the corresponding increase in threats
against Members demonstrate security remains paramount. The
Committee supports funding for the United States Capitol Police
and the House Sergeant at Arms for these efforts.
The second measure before us, Committee Resolution 115-7,
clarifies certain provisions and makes additional technical
corrections to the Members' Congressional Handbook, and I will
mention a few. First, the Committee Resolution incorporates the
prohibitions contained in H. Res. 724, which we passed earlier
this month. H. Res. 724, among other things, prohibits the
Members' representational allowance from being used for
settlements or for an award in connection with conduct
prohibited by the Congressional Accountability Act.
The Committee resolution also clarifies the use of the MRA
for security, including allowing prior year funds to be
obligated for security furnishings and enhancements, clarifies
the role of the House Sergeant at Arms in approving noncapital
security enhancements; clarifies responsibility for costs
associated with security enhancements considered capital
improvements; clarifies payments for security personnel are an
ordinary and reimbursable expense; and, lastly, clarifies
security items exceeding $500 must be added to office
inventory.
Finally, the third measure on our docket, Committee
Resolution 115-8, mirrors the changes in the Members'
Congressional Handbook as it relates to settlements and awards
under the Congressional Accountability Act. The measure
prohibits Committee funding from being used for settlements or
awards in connection with conduct prohibited by the
Congressional Accountability Act.
I would now like to recognize my colleague and the
Committee's Ranking Member, Mr. Brady, for the purpose of
providing an opening statement.
Mr. Brady. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this
business meeting today.
I support the three Committee resolutions before us.
However, we do intend to file minority views on the proposed
views and estimates on the President's budget, as we do have
some well-known disagreements about the Election Assistance
Commission and the Federal Election Commission.
And, of course, we support the ban on using the MRA or
Committee funds to settle sexual harassments and discrimination
cases. That is a very long overdue commonsense change, and I
appreciate your bipartisan work on that. I encourage my
colleagues to support the proposal before us, and I yield back
the balance of my time.
The Chairman. The gentleman yields back.
Does any other Member wish to be recognized for the
purposes of an opening statement?

Committee Resolution 115-6, the views and estimates for fiscal
year 2019.

Without objection, the markup is adjourned.
