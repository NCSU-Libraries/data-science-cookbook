MEMBER DAY HEARING
----------
Wednesday, April 3, 2019
U.S. House of Representatives,
Committee on Financial Services,
Washington, D.C.
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:06 a.m., in
room 2128, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Maxine Waters
[chairwoman of the committee] presiding.
Members present: Representatives Waters, Foster, Vargas,
Casten, Phillips; McHenry, Luetkemeyer, and Williams.
Chairwoman Waters. The Financial Services Committee will
come to order. Without objection, the Chair is authorized to
declare a recess of the committee at any time.
Today, the committee will hear from Members of the House on
matters of interest to them pursuant to Section 2(j) of H.Res.6
which requires each standing committee to hold a hearing at
which it receives testimony from Members, Delegates, and the
Resident Commissioner on proposed legislation within its
jurisdiction.
The committee welcomes Members to discuss their priorities
for this Congress.
And so, the Chair now recognizes the distinguished Ranking
Republican Member, Mr. McHenry, for 5 minutes for any remarks
he might want to give.
Mr. McHenry. I will be brief. Thank you, Chairwoman Waters,
for yielding, and for holding this hearing. I think it is
important to hear from our colleagues who wish to testify
before the committee to give feedback on the direction she
should be taking, I should be taking, other committee members
should be taking, and the concerted effort we have for an
agenda coming out of this committee.
And while there are areas of broad disagreement, there are
also areas of broad agreement. My hope is that we will focus on
areas of agreement and try to legislate in a bipartisan way.
That is my hope. That is my interest and I am interested to
hear from my colleagues on what they hope for us to achieve as
a committee and as a Congress.
With that, I will yield back.
Chairwoman Waters. Thank you very much.
This is Members' Day. And this is an opportunity for the
Members of Congress to come before this committee to talk about
their concerns. Now, this was created in an effort to help
Members know and understand what each of these committees are
doing. And Members are very busy and they decide where they
want to spend their time.
Many of our Members who have been around for a while, know
pretty much what is happening on these committees, and they
don't take time to do that.
Many of our newer Members are busy trying to get to the
committees that they are assigned to and to do the work that is
necessary for them to be prepared for hearings, et cetera.
So, I don't expect that we are going to hear from Members
in the way that the leadership anticipated in making this
opportunity available. With that, we could do one of two
things. We could use this time for Members of the committee to
talk about their concerns, however, I do not wish to recommend
that.
I wish to say thank you to our Members who showed up this
morning. I wish to say thank you to our Ranking Member who
showed up this morning.
And if there are no questions that you absolutely have to
have, this committee is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 10:10 a.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
