DHS'S PROGRESS IN SECURING ELECTION SYSTEMS AND OTHER CRITICAL
INFRASTRUCTURE
----------
Wednesday, July 11, 2018
U.S. House of Representatives,
Committee on Homeland Security,
Washington, DC.
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 10:31 a.m., in
room HVC-210, Capitol Visitor Center, Hon. Michael T. McCaul
(Chairman of the committee) presiding.
Present: Representatives McCaul, King, Rogers, Barletta,
Perry, Katko, Hurd, McSally, Fitzpatrick, Estes, Bacon, Lesko,
Thompson, Jackson Lee, Langevin, Keating, Payne, Vela, Watson
Coleman, Rice, Correa, Demings, and Barragan.
Chairman McCaul. The Committee on Homeland Security will
come to order.
The committee is meeting today to examine the work that the
Department of Homeland Security is doing to assist State and
local officials to secure election infrastructure, including
voting machines, vote tallying systems, and voter databases.
In addition to election security, we will also examine
DHS's role working across all 16 critical infrastructures,
because a cyber threat to elections may pose a similar threat
to other critical infrastructure sectors.
I now recognize myself for an opening statement.
Our democratic system and critical infrastructures are
under attack. In 2016, Russia meddled in our Presidential
election through a series of cyber attacks and information
warfare. Their goals were to undermine the credibility of the
outcome and sow discord and chaos among the American people.
This was a provocative attack against our country; we must
not allow it to happen again. I have stated repeatedly and long
before the last election that foreign interference in our
democracy cannot be tolerated. I strongly believe we will be
targeted again this November in the midterm elections, and we
need to be prepared.
That is why we included $380 million in grants to the
Election Assistance Commission and $26 million to the
Department of Homeland Security for election infrastructure in
fiscal year 2018. These funds will enhance election technology
and bolster cyber readiness.
However, malicious use of the internet and the exploitation
of social media are not just aimed at our election systems. In
March, the FBI and DHS reported that Russian hackers attacked
American nuclear power plants. Crippling or shutting down major
parts of our energy sector would be catastrophic.
Russia has already done this to our allies. In 2015, a
cyber attack turned off electricity for hundreds of thousands
of Ukrainians. Last year, I stood on the front lines of
Russia's cyber war in Ukraine and saw the effects first-hand.
Nation-state hacking is real and it is dangerous.
Unfortunately, Russia is not the only villain. Between 2011 and
2013, Iranian hackers attacked dozens of U.S. banks and tried
to shut down a dam in New York. In 2014, Chinese hackers stole
22 million security clearances from OPM, including my own.
These attacks and others are part of a greater onslaught being
waged against the United States.
As a result, I have made strengthening our cybersecurity a
top priority of this committee. In the past year we have passed
legislation to create the Cyber Security and Infrastructure
Security Agency to elevate and operationalize the cybersecurity
mission at DHS; authorize cyber incident response teams to
assist local and State officials in identifying cyber risks and
restoring essential services; and reauthorize DHS to ensure it
offers services to local and State election officials upon
request.
We are proud of these accomplishments, but we can always do
more. So today's hearing gives us a chance to offer new ideas
and promote new solutions to help protect our elections and
other critical infrastructures.
I would like to thank the witnesses for being here today.
We are grateful for your service to the country and expertise
and look forward to working with each of you.

In the past year we have passed legislation to:
Create the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency
(CISA)--to elevate and operationalize the cybersecurity mission
at DHS,
Authorize Cyber Incident Response Teams--to assist local and
State officials in identifying cyber risks and restoring
essential services,
Reauthorize DHS--to ensure DHS offers services to local and
State election officials when requested (Richmond amendment).
We are proud of these accomplishments but we can always do more.
Today's hearing gives us a chance to offer new ideas and promote
solutions to help protect our elections and other critical
infrastructure.
I'd like to thank the witnesses for joining us today. This
committee is very grateful for your service and expertise and we look
forward to working with each of you.
Chairman McCaul. With that, the Chairman now recognizes the
Ranking Member.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to
thank you for holding today's hearing on election security.
I, too, would like to congratulate and thank Under
Secretary Krebs for being here today. Good seeing you. I look
forward to working with you to make sure DHS legislative
authorities and responsibilities related to cybersecurity are
well understood, and to ensure that the Department has the
resources it needs to carry out the mission effectively.
Under Secretary, you have taken the job at a critical
moment in our Nation. However, I am concerned you do not have
the support you need from the White House.
You are responsible for building private-sector confidence
in DHS information-sharing programs like Automated Indicator
Sharing after President Trump toyed with the idea of planting
an absurd story to discredit its own--for its own political
purposes.
You are responsible for securing Federal networks at a time
when the White House National security advisor has decided to
eliminate the National Security Council's cybersecurity
coordinator.
You are responsible for helping secure critical
infrastructure networks for a White House that would rather
save jobs in China than heed the advice of intelligence
community on supply chain vulnerabilities.
And you are responsible for helping State and local
governments secure election infrastructures following Russia's
brazen election meddling efforts in 2016, which the President
has been reluctant to call out and which Congressional
Republicans, until recently, were content to ignore.
As we sit here today, President Trump is in Europe
complicating your mission. Instead of working with our European
allies to confront Russia, a shared adversary whose attempts to
undermine Western Democratic institutions are growing more and
more bold, he is trolling them to curry favor with Russian
President Vladimir Putin.
President Trump has said he will address Russia's 2016
election meddling in a meeting with Putin, but he has never
demonstrated a credible ability to confront Putin in our
intelligence community's findings. He has predicted his
meetings with Putin may be the easiest, so I know and I have no
reason to believe anything productive will come of it.
This President's failure to take seriously the threat to
our democracy is one of the main reasons that we must do
effective and thorough oversight in this body.
Although I am pleased that the Majority has finally
scheduled today's hearing, I am disappointed that the Majority
failed to invite a full range of stakeholders, including the
Election Assistance Commission, or hold the hearing at a time
when DHS's Federal partners were available to participate.
It is important to note for the record that committee
Democrats have been requesting official oversight activities on
elections security since before the 2016 election.
In March 2017, after months of inaction by the Republican
majority, I introduced a resolution of inquiry seeking
information from the Department on its activities relating to
counter--countering Russian election interference in the 2016
Presidential election, so we would understand how to protect
our elections in the future. It was unceremoniously rejected
along party lines.
Committee Democrats have written to the Chairman no less
than 5 times since August 2016 to request a hearing, briefing,
or investigation on vulnerabilities to our election
infrastructure. We have also reiterated these requests on
numerous occasions on the record.
Despite these repeated requests, this committee did not
conduct a formal hearing or briefing on the topic until April
2018, 15 months after the intelligence community released its
report concluding that the Russian government had attempted to
interfere in the 2016 elections and would attempt to do so
again.
When the Trump administration's 6 top intelligence
officials testified before the Senate that Russia was targeting
2018 elections, this committee, the committee that prides
itself on acting in the wake of current issues, followed suit
of the House Republican conference by shirking its
responsibility to act on this urgent threat.
Ranking Members of the Oversight and Government Reform
Committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, Judiciary Committee,
the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Armed
Services, and the House Administration Committee have all urged
the Chairs or Speaker Ryan to aggressively address this on-
going National threat. Our calls for action were ignored,
responded to with a halfhearted acknowledgment of the threat
and a vague promise for future action, or the offer to ask a
Government witness about election security at a hearing on
another topic.
Because of--our request for thorough hearings and briefings
were denied, some committee Democrats joined the Democrats on
the Committee of House Administration to form the Congressional
Task Force on Election Security. I openly asked Republicans to
join us and submit their ideas, yet no Republican Member
provided their input or attended the task force's public
events.
After studying the topics for 8 months, meeting with
stakeholders and holding a series of forums and briefings, the
task force produced a report and introduced legislation to
implement the recommendations.
Mr. Chairman, I have a stack of requests made by Democrats
for action on election security, a copy of the report on
legislation I referenced, and other election security oversight
documents, and I ask that they be entered into record at this
time.
Chairman McCaul. Without objection, so ordered.

Submitted For the Record by Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson
Letter From Honorable Engel, Conyers, and Thompson
July 25, 2016.
The Honorable James B. Comey,
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, FBI Headquarters, 935
Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20535.
The Honorable Ashton B. Carter,
Secretary of Defense, U.S. Department of Defense, 1300 Defense
Pentagon, Washington, DC 20301.
The Honorable John F. Kerry,
Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, 2201 C Street NW,
Washington, DC 20520.
The Honorable James R. Clapper,
Director of National Intelligence, Office of the Director of National
Intelligence, Washington, DC 20511.
Dear Director Corney, Secretaries Kerry and Carter, and General
Clapper: As senior Members of national security committees in Congress,
we are deeply troubled by reports of a Russia-supported hacking of
Democratic National Committee data, and we applaud the FBI's quick
action launching an investigation. We request that the Administration
brief Members of Congress on this situation as soon as possible in
unclassified or classified settings as needed.
We see two separate issues at play here, both of which deserve the
focus of investigators and congressional overseers.
First, the DNC hack was plainly cyber crime. More and more,
America's adversaries are employing cyber theft and cyber terrorism as
tactics to threaten our security. We need to understand fully the
extent of the hack and work to determine who was responsible. We need
to assess whose personal information was compromised by the attack and
ensure those individuals have what they need to prevent any further
damage. We need to determine what vulnerabilities allowed this attack
to succeed, and provide information to the public about how to guard
against future attacks of this nature.
Second--and perhaps more important--the timing and content of the
theft, targeting one of our two major political parties, makes clear
that this cyber attack amounts to more than a public embarrassment or
harmless mischief. If reports of Russia's involvement are confirmed,
the only reasonable conclusion is that leaders in Russia are stealing
and disseminating information in an effort to sway an election in the
United States.
This is an action right out of President Putin's playbook. In
recent years, Russia has influenced elections, infiltrated political
parties across Europe, and stoked divisive politics in the hope of
fracturing Western unity. It doesn't stretch the imagination that Mr.
Putin would now try his hand at manipulating the course of American
democracy--leaking information through a syndicate that has repeated
anti-Semitic insinuations, endangered lives, and threatened American
security by recklessly releasing stolen information. That scenario
should sound the alarm for people across this country.
That's why we also ask that the FBI collaborate with the
Departments of State and Defense and the Intelligence Community to
obtain a complete picture of Russia's involvement and its leaders
intentions. Nearly a half century ago, a break-in at the DNC
headquarters eventually led to the end of a Presidency. For a foreign
government to engage in the same sort of behavior cannot be tolerated.
Russia doesn't get to put its thumb on the scale in our elections. In
the days ahead, we need to send a clear message to Russia's leaders and
all who mean us harm: we will not allow the Kremlin or any other
foreign power to dictate the terms of political debate in this country.
With the clock ticking down to our election, we ask for quick
action on this matter. The American people deserve to go to the polls
in November confident that Russian subterfuge has had no role in
setting the agenda for our country's future.
Sincerely,
Eliot L. Engel,
Ranking Member, House Foreign Affairs Committee.
John Conyers, Jr.,
Ranking Member, House Judiciary Committee.
Bennie G. Thompson,
Ranking Member, House Homeland Security Committee.

Letter From Honorable Cummmings, Conyers, Engel, and Thompson
August 30, 2016.
The Honorable James Comey,
Director, Federal Bureau of Investigation, 935 Pennsylvania Avenue NW,
Washington, DC 20530.
Dear Mr. Director: Based on multiple press reports, it appears that
the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is investigating whether
Russia executed cyber attacks against the Democratic National Committee
(DNC) and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) that
resulted in the illegal hacking of a wide range of emails and other
documents.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Party's Emails to Help Donald Trump, Los Angeles Times (July 25, 2016)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We are writing to request that the FBI assess whether connections
between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests may have
contributed to these attacks in order to interfere with the U.S.
Presidential election.
Serious questions have been raised about overt and covert actions
by Trump campaign officials on behalf of Russian interests. It is
critical for the American public to know whether those actions may have
directly caused or indirectly motivated attacks against Democratic
institutions and our fundamental election process.
On July 22, 2016, just days before the Democratic convention,
approximately 20,000 pages of illegally hacked documents were leaked by
WikiLeaks in an apparent attempt to influence the U.S. Presidential
election in favor of Donald Trump.\2\ According to one press report:

democratic-convention-wikileaks-releases-thousands-of-documents-about-
clinton-the-campaign-and-internal-deliberations/).
``The FBI suspects that Russian government hackers breached the
networks of the Democratic National Committee and stole emails that
were posted to the anti-secrecy site WikiLeaks on Friday. It's an
operation that several U.S. officials now suspect was a deliberate
attempt to influence the Presidential election in favor of Donald
Trump, according to five individuals familiar with the investigation of
the breach.''\3\

Donald Trump has repeatedly praised Russian President Vladimir
Putin, stating that ``he's doing a great job,''\4\ ``I'd get along very

Donald Trump has proposed shocking policy positions that would
greatly benefit Russia, including breaking from longstanding U.S.
commitments to our NATO allies to combat Russian aggression \8\ and
weakening sanctions and recognizing Russia's annexation of Crimea.\9\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Of direct concern, however, are Donald Trump's comments encouraging
Russian hacking and his top aides' previously undisclosed connections
to Russian officials and interests.
On July 27, 2016--the third day of the Democratic convention--
Donald Trump urged Russia to hack Secretary Hillary Clinton's
emails.\10\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Less than 2 weeks later, on August 8, 2016, Roger Stone, a Donald
Trump confidante, revealed that he has communicated with WikiLeaks
founder Julian Assange about the upcoming release of additional
illegally hacked Democratic documents. Mr. Stone made these statements
during a Republican campaign event while answering a question about a
potential ``October surprise.''\11\

Washington Examiner (Aug. 9, 2016) (on-line at
www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-ally-claims-he-communicated-with-
wikileaks-founder/article/2598931).
It is unclear whether U.S. law enforcement authorities have
interviewed Mr. Stone about his communications with Mr. Assange or
about his knowledge of how WikiLeaks obtained the illegally hacked
documents.
In addition, on July 7, 2016, one of Donald Trump's foreign policy
advisers, Carter Page, traveled to Moscow to give a speech that was
harshly critical of the United States and its ``hypocritical focus on
ideas such as democratization, inequality, corruption and regime
change.''\12\ Mr. Page had touted his extensive dealings with Russian
energy giant Gazprom, claiming that he had been an adviser ``on key
transactions for Gazprom.''\13\ After Donald Trump named Mr. Page as
his foreign policy adviser in March, Mr. Page explained that ``his
business has suffered directly from the U.S. economic sanctions imposed
after Russia's escalating involvement in the Ukraine.''\14\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Mr. Page appears to enjoy high-level access to Russian officials
that are currently under sanctions imposed by the United States
Government. According to one press report:
``After the Obama administration added Rosneft Chainnan Igor Sechin to
its sanctions list in 2014, limiting Sechin's ability to travel to the
United States or do business with U.S. firms, Page praised the fmmer
deputy prime minister, considered one of Putin's closest allies over
the past 25 years. Sechin has done more to advance U.S.-Russian
relations than any individual in or out of government from either side
of the Atlantic over the past decade,' Page wrote.''\15\

It is unclear whether U.S. law enforcement authorities have
interviewed Mr. Page about whether he met with Mr. Sechin or other
individuals on the U.S. sanctions list during his trip to Moscow or on
other occasions.
Another top adviser to Donald Trump, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn,
traveled to Moscow in December 2015 and joined Vladimir Putin at the
head table during a dinner honoring the Kremlin-backed media network
RT. During the event, General Flynn gave a speech that was highly
critical of the United States, stating, ``The United States can't sit
there and say, `Russia, you're bad.' '' \16\ The following week,
President Putin praised Donald Trump as ``an outstanding and talented
personality.''\17\ General Flynn declined to answer media inquiries
about whether he traveled to Moscow on Donald Trnmp's behalf.\18\

Most recently, Donald Trump's campaign chairman, Paul Manafort,
resigned after failing to disclose his role in assisting a pro-Russian
party in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort reportedly had ``wooed investments from
oligarchs linked to Putin and advised the now-toppled pro-Russian
Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych.''\19\ According to one press
account:

``Donald Trump's campaign chairman helped a pro-Russian governing party
in Ukraine secretly route at least $2.2 million in payments to two
prominent Washington lobbying firms in 2012, and did so in a way that
effectively obscured the foreign political party's efforts to influence
U.S. policy. . . .Under Federal law, U.S. lobbyists must declare
publicly if they represent foreign leaders or their political parties

Rick Gates, a top strategist in Donald Trump's campaign, reportedly
worked with Mr. Manafort on this effort, ``helping steer the advocacy
work done by a pro-Yanukovych nonprofit,'' including ``downplaying the
necessity of a Congressional resolution meant to pressure the Ukrainian
leader to release an imprisoned political rival.''\21\ Although Mr.
Manafort has resigned from his position, it appears that Mr. Gates
continues to be a top adviser to Mr. Trump.

It is unclear whether U.S. law enforcement authorities have
interviewed Mr. Manafort or Mr. Page about their failure to disclose
this information, but several prominent members of Mr. Trump's party
have expressed grave concerns.
For example, Republican Adam Kinzinger of Illinois called for an
investigation into Donald Trump's ``chief adviser, what his association
with the Russians are.'' More broadly, Rep. Kinzinger criticized ``this
affection in the campaign for Russia and Vladimir Putin,'' and he
questioned how and why a reference to Russian offensive weapons was
mysteriously removed from the Republican Party's platform, noting that
``it just happened.''\22\

The Honorable Michael McCaul,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security Washington, DC 20515.
The Honorable Bennie Thompson,
Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson: As a Senior
Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am writing to
request that the committee convene a joint briefing with the Select
Committee on Intelligence, Foreign Affairs, and House Administration to
discuss specific threats to the U.S. election systems from outside
influences. It has been reported that attempts have already been made
to compromise the integrity of State-wide voter registration databases
for Illinois and Arizona.
On August 15, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson held a
conference call with the National Association of Secretaries of State
and election officials to discuss the election infrastructure
cybersecurity. During that call Secretary Johnson offered Federal
assistance to State officials in managing risks to voting systems in
their jurisdiction.
State-wide centralized voter registration systems are used by many
States during elections to authenicated voters to determine who can
cast a ballot. One of the threats to the election system would be a
``denial of service'' attack that prevents local polling locations from
accessing information on registered voters.
For these reasons, I believe that it is important that a joint
briefing with the Select Committee on Intelligence, Foreign Affairs,
and House Administration be held at the earliest possible time.
If you have questions regarding this request, please contact me
through my Homeland Security Policy Advisor, Lillie Coney.

Letter From Seven Members of Congress
December 6, 2016.
President Barack Obama,
The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20500.
Dear Mr. President: We are deeply concerned by Russian efforts to
undermine, interfere with, and even influence the outcome of our recent
election. This Russian malfeasance is not confined to us, but extends
to our allies, our alliances and to democratic institutions around the
world.
The integrity of democracy must never be in question, and we are
gravely concerned that Russia may have succeeded in weakening
Americans' trust in our electoral institutions through their cyber
activity, which may also include sponsoring disclosures through
WikiLeaks and other venues, and the production and distribution of fake
news stories.
Foreign interference presents a win-win for Russia--which we must
counter. By eroding Americans' and foreigners' trust in U.S.
institutions, Russia both weakens our country and sows global
instability and uncertainty. Both present a boon for Russia and a loss
for those working to maintain peace and prosperity around the world
through the leadership of the United States and its allies.
To evaluate Congress's response appropriately, we would like all
Members to have a comprehensive understanding of what the U.S.
intelligence community knows regarding Russia's involvement in these
actions and attempts to interfere in our election. Specifically, we are
requesting a classified briefing that will provide details regarding
Russian entities' hacking of American political organizations; hacking
and strategic release of emails from campaign officials; the WikiLeaks
disclosures; fake news stories produced and distributed with the intent
to mislead American voters; and any other Russian or Russian-related
interference or involvement in our recent election.
We thank you for your attention to this matter.

Letter From Honorable Jackson Lee
December 13, 2016.
The Honorable Michael McCaul,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, 176 Ford HOB, Washington, DC
20515.
The Honorable Bennie Thompson,
Ranking Member, Committee on Homeland Security, H2-117 Ford HOB,
Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson: As a Member of
the standing Committee on Homeland Security since its creation, I am
writing to respectfully request that the committee conduct thorough and
probing hearings regarding the activities of entities allied with the
Government of Russia to influence the outcome of the 2016 presidential
election in the United States when the 115th Congress convenes in
January 2017.
Given your strong commitment to the rule of law and constitutional
governance, and your demonstrated record of working together
constructively, I know you find it as deeply disturbing as I do that
the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded, in a secret assessment,
that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win
the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S.
electoral system.
This is as grave an attack on American independence and sovereignty
as Pearl Harbor and 9/11. It cannot be allowed to stand with impunity.
The facts and actors involved in this plot must be uncovered and laid
bare for the American people to see and understand.
The Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which includes
the Central Intelligence Agency, has cited a growing body of
intelligence from multiple sources confirming that the politically
motivated hacks of the 2016 election originated at the highest levels
of the Kremlin and confirmed that the activity was intended to favor
Presidential candidate Trump. This election malfeasance on the part of
the Government of Russia appears to be part of wider strategy to
disrupt and destabilize the political system and economies ofthe
western democracies.
The integrity of the democratic process must never be in question,
and I am very concerned that Russian interference in the recent
election may have inflicted substantial damage to Americans' confidence
in the political system. That interference includes, but is not limited
to sponsoring disclosures through WikiLeaks and other venues, the
production and distribution of fake news stories to influence
traditional and social media, and cyber attacks on computing networks
used by local and State election administrations and political
organizations to communicate with voters, constituents, and other
members of the public.
Foreign interference in U.S. elections also represents a serious
threat to National security to the full enjoyment and exercise ofthe
civil liberties and rights Americans justly value and cherish. There
can be no higher priority for the next Congress than ensuring that the
election process, the hallmark of this democratic republic's
governance, is invulnerable to foreign influence or manipulation.
Specifically, the House Homeland Security Committee should
investigate the findings of the intelligence community thorough a
comprehensive, or ``deep-dive,'' investigation of the cyber attacks
that plagued the 2016 Presidential election, including cyber attacks
previously designed to undermine the campaign of the Democratic
Presidential candidate which were previously determined by the U.S.
intelligence community to be connected to entities allied with the
Government of Russia. Further, the hearings should explore the impact,
if any, that media reporting of WikiLeaks data breach information had
on voter decisions in the 2016 election and the influence of ``fake
news,'' false stories deliberately injected into the news mainstream to
mislead and misinform voters, such as the Comet Ping Pong incident
which led a North Carolina man to fire rounds from an AR-15 rifle into
a crowd at a pizzeria in Washington, DC.
The linchpin of representative democracies such as the United
States is public confidence in the political system, regime, and
community. That confidence in turn rests upon the extent to which the
public has faith that the system employed to select its leaders
accurately reflects its preferences. At bottom, this means that the
American people must be able to freely elect their leaders without
interference, covert or overt, from foreign governments or entities
allied with foreign powers.
For these reasons, it is essential that when the 115th Congress
convenes in January 2017, the Committee on the Homeland Security
conduct thorough and probing inquiry regarding the activities of
entities allied with the Government of Russia to influence the outcome
of the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.
Thank you for your consideration of this urgent request. If you
have questions or need further information, contact me through my Chief
of Staff, Glenn Rushing.
Very Truly Yours,
Sheila Jackson Lee,
MEMBER OF CONGRESS.

Letter From Honorable Thompson and Richmond
May 23, 2017.
President Donald J. Trump,
The White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW Washington, DC 20500.
Dear Mr. President: Last week, reports surfaced that the White
House may be planning to create a false narrative about the Department
of Homeland Security's Automated Indicator Sharing (AIS) program in
order to neutralize criticism over your handling of classified
information with Russian officials.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Foreign Policy, ``Trump Team Planning Possible Retaliation for
Classified Leak Allegation,'' by Jenna McLaughlin (May 18, 2017),
http://foreignpolicy.com/2017/05/18/trump-team-planning-possible-
retaliation-for-classified-leak-allegations/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
According to a piece in Foreign Policy (FP), White House officials
met last Wednesday to discuss the possibility of planting a story in
the media or opening an investigation to accuse DHS of using the AIS
platform to ``inappropriately open up streams of sensitive data to
Russia and other nonallies.''\2\ These officials hoped to create the
illusion that AIS, a public-facing portal that does not deal in
classified information, exhibits careless information practices by the
Obama administration roughly equivalent to your disclosure of
intelligence gathered by a foreign ally. A second source confirmed that
``Trump and his team have been interested in targeting the Homeland
Security program for the past couple weeks. Nothing has been decided .
. . but it's an option on the table.''\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Id. (quoting the article, not the source).
\3\ Id. (quoting the article, not the source).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
These reports, if true, are deeply troubling. The AIS program is
the result of bipartisan legislation enacted in the 114th Congress,
after years of negotiation between privacy, security, and industry
stakeholders in an effort to speed public-private sharing of cyber
threat indicators. In a press release celebrating AIS' launch last
year, DHS described the capability as ``the `See Something, Say
Something' of the internet,'' noting that:
``When one participant detects a threat, all participants in AIS will
learn about it. By broadening the depth and increasing the speed of
cybersecurity information sharing, the country as a whole will be
better able to manage cyber threats. The Cybersecurity Act of 2015 also
provides targeted liability protection to companies that share cyber
threat indicators with DHS or with each other. And like all of the
Department's cybersecurity programs, AIS includes rigorous privacy and
civil liberties protections.''\4\

Machine Speed,'' (March 17, 2016), https://www.dhs.gov/blog/2016/03/17/

Despite holding enormous promise, AIS is still in its nascent
stages. The Department should be using its limited resources to grow
the capability and build trusted partnerships with its customer base,
rather than fighting off baseless accusations. While we sincerely hope
that the accounts in the FP report are not true, we nevertheless cannot
stand aside and allow the White House to jeopardize this important
program in a self-serving attempt to change the news cycle.
Pursuant to Rule X(3)(g) and Rule XI of the Rules of the House of
Representatives, we respectfully request you provide a written response
to the following information, and whatever supplementary information
you deem responsive, by June 1, 2017.
1. Please provide a detailed log of meetings held at the White
House on Wednesday, May 17, 2017, accompanied by a list of attendees.
If the meeting described herein, with respect to DHS' Automated
Indicator Sharing program, indeed occurred, please provide any notes,
discussion drafts, or other materials generated in advance of, during,
or subsequent to the discussion.
2. Please provide the dates, times, and attendees of any meetings
White House officials have held where DHS cybersecurity information
sharing programs, including the Automated Indicator Sharing program,
may have been discussed.
3. Has the White House directed an investigation into how the DHS
Automated Indicator Sharing program shares cyber threat information
with its partners, including international partners? If so, on what
grounds?
4. If the White House is considering or considered planting a false
story about the Automated Indicator Sharing program, as indicated in
the FP piece, please provide any meeting notes, drafts, and other
related materials that describe the details of such a story.
Thank you for your attention to this matter. If you have any
questions, please contact Hope Goins, Minority Staff Director.

Letter From Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson
May 23, 2017.
The Honorable Michael T. McCaul,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, H2-176 Ford House Office
Building, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman McCaul: I am writing to express my continued
commitment to examining the Russian government's interference in the
2016 elections.
On April 5, during the consideration of a measure to jumpstart an
investigation into what the Department of Homeland Security knew and
did about this unprecedented attack on our democracy (H. Res. 235), you
indicated that, while you opposed my resolution of inquiry, you
supported examining this issue through the normal committee process. At
the time, you suggested that Members could ask DHS Secretary Kelly
about Russian interference when he testifies next before the committee.
While asking one-off questions of the Secretary at a public hearing of
Government officials in a closed-door meeting here or overseas may
yield some information, it does not replace the need for a
comprehensive investigation. The gravity of this matter demands more;
it demands that the committee launch a bipartisan investigation--
particularly given recent developments surrounding the Russia
investigation.
Following President Trump's abrupt firing of FBI Director Comey
earlier this month, a special counsel was appointed by the Deputy
Attorney General to oversee the investigation, which FBI Director Comey
initiated, into Russian meddling in our elections. Since then, the
drumbeat for an independent commission that cannot be interfered with
by the Trump administration steadily intensified. As I said during my
opening statement when H. Res. 235 was considered, current
investigations under way in Congress and at the Justice Department are
not likely to focus on DHS's efforts--which are important to evaluate
given that the Russians are expected to attempt to interfere in future
U.S. elections. As such, now is the time for this committee to launch
its own bipartisan inquiry.
I share the view that you expressed at our April markup that any
foreign government interference in our elections is unacceptable and
should not go unpunished. By launching a committee investigation, we
could do our part to ensure not only that those involved are punished
but that State officials responsible for overseeing our elections have
the answers they need to guard against future interference. Protecting
our election systems has been and will continue to be a bipartisan
issue. I truly hope that we can begin to address this matter with the
seriousness that it deserves, and look forward to working with you to
undertake oversight into DHS's efforts to identify and mitigate harm to
our election systems.
Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. If you have
any questions, please contact Rosaline Cohen, Chief Counsel for
Legislation.
Sincerely,
Bennie G. Thompson,
Ranking Member.

Letter From Twelve Members of Congress
June 21, 2017.
The Honorable John F. Kelly,
Secretary, U.S. Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20528.
Dear Secretary Kelly: We write to express our concern regarding
recent statements you have made with respect to the designation of
election infrastructure as a critical infrastructure subsector and to
seek clarification regarding what you envision the Department of
Homeland Security's (the Department or DHS) role to be when it comes to
securing election infrastructure.
On January 6, 2017, the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence (ODNI) released a report, completed in coordination with
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), and National Security Agency (NSA), entitled Background to
``Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent US Elections'':
The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution. The declassified
version of the report made several concerning findings related to the
depth and breadth of Russia's efforts to interfere in the 2016
Presidential elections, including that ``Russian intelligence obtained
and maintained access to elements of multiple US State or local
electoral boards.''\1\ Ultimately, the ODNI assessed that ``Moscow will
apply lessons learned from its Putin-ordered campaign aimed at the US
Presidential election to future influence efforts worldwide, including
against US allies and their election processes.''\2\

\2\ Id.

The same day, your predecessor, then-Secretary Jeh Johnson,
designated election infrastructure as critical infrastructure.\3\ In
making the designation, then-Secretaiy Johnson stated:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Statement by U.S. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh
Johnson on the Designation of Election Infrastructure as a Critical
Infrastructure Subsector, (Jan. 6, 2017), available at https://
www.dhs.gov/news/2017/01/06/statement-secretary-johnson-designation-
election-infrastructure-critical. ``Election Infrastructure'' includes:
``storage facilities, polling places, and centralized vote tabulations
locations used to support the election process, and information and
communications technology to include voter registration databases,
voting machines, and other systems to manage the election process and
report and display results on behalf of State and local governments.''
Id.
``I have determined that election infrastructure in this country should
be designated as a subsector of the existing Government Facilities
critical infrastructure sector. Given the vital role elections play in
this country, it is clear that certain systems and assets of election
infrastructure meet the definition ofcritical infrastructure, in fact
and in law.
``I have reached this determination so that election infrastructure
will, on a more formal and enduring basis, be a priority for
cybersecurity assistance and protections that the Department of
Homeland Security provides to a range of private and public sector
entities.''\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ Id.
Importantly, then-Secretaiy Johnson made clear that a State or
local election board's decision to avail itself of DHS' cybersecurity
resources is voluntary. The designation allows the Department ``to
prioritize our cybersecurity assistance to [S]tate and local election
officials, but only for those who request it.''\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Id.
``In light ofthe mounting evidence that Russia sought to interfere with
the 2016 election to both sway the outcome and erode public confidence
in our democratic institutions--an objective it had pursued for over a
decade--we supported the designation of election infrastructure as a
critical infrastructure subsector and were interested in ensuring that
the new administration would continue to prioritize cybersecurity
assistance to State and local election officials. Accordingly, when you
first testified before our Committee on February 7, 2017, you were
asked about your views on the critical infrastructure subsector
designation. You assuaged our concern that the administration might
rescind the designation when you responded: `I believe we should help
all of the [S]tates--provide them as much help as we can to make sure
that their systems are protected in future elections. So, I would argue
that, yes, we should keep that in place.' ''\6\

Four months later, you testified before our committee once again.
This time, your remarks called into question your commitment to honor
the designation of election infrastructure as critical infrastructure.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
You stated:
``My predecessor, Jeh Johnson, just before he left, designated the
whole system as critical infrastructure. I've had a lot of push-back
from [M]embers of Congress, both sides of the aisle. Governors have
pushed back on that . . . I'm meeting with all of the Homeland
Security--I believe it's next week--their Homeland Security [S]tate
advisors. This will be a topic that we'll bring up about do they feel
it's needed. But by no means do we have any intention, desire, or move
to take over any [S]tate process or tell the [S]tates how to do
business.''\7\

Aside from the resistance you have described from some Members of
Congress and State officials, it is hard to understand what has changed
since you testified in February that would establish reasonable grounds
to reconsider the designation. Indeed, the only new information to
emerge in the interim is even more disturbing evidence regarding the
scope and breadth of Russian efforts to disrupt the 2016 elections.
And, to disabuse Congress of the notion that Russia's interference in
the 2016 elections was an isolated incident, then-FBI Director James
Comey warned the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence in
March: ``[T]hey'll be back. And they'll be back in 2020. They may be
back in 2018.''\8\

Since the beginning of the month, news reports have revealed that
Russia's efforts to penetrate election systems was far more successful
in scope than previously understood, and involved sending spearfishing
emails to over 100 election officials to gain access to their
networks.\9\ Investigators in Illinois found evidence Russian hackers
gained access to software designed to be used by poll workers on
Election Day in the summer and fall of 2016 and attempted to delete or
alter voter data. Hackers compromised 90,000 records in Illinois, and
gained access to the State voter database that included names, dates of
birth, genders, driver's licenses, and partial Social Security numbers
on 15 million people.\10\

There is no evidence that attempts to interfere in our elections--be it

the cybersecurity threats to election infrastructure are only growing
more complex. It is more important than ever that State and local

necessary to protect our elections from future attack.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Over the past 5 months, we have co-chaired an Election Security
Task Force to better understand what can be done to protect our
elections going forward. Our findings demonstrate that there is an
urgent need for Federal funding to help States secure their elections.
Through our investigation, we found that voting machines can easily
be hacked. In July, at DefCon, one of the world's largest, longest-
running, and best-known hacker conferences, 25 pieces of election
equipment were successfully breached by participants with little prior
knowledge and limited tools.\2\ In over 40 States, elections are
carried out using voting machines that were purchased more than a
decade ago.\3\ These machines are now either obsolete or at the end of
their useful life. Some of these machines rely on operating systems
like Windows XP or Windows 2000 which pose a particularly significant
security risk as those operating systems either do not receive regular
security patches, or have stopped receiving support altogether.\4\
These issues are exacerbated by the fact that 20 percent of Americans
cast their ballot on voting machines that do not have any kind of paper
backup.\5\ In other words, if these paperless machines were hacked, it
would be nearly impossible to tell.\6\

State voter registration databases are also vulnerable to attack.
In Illinois, hackers successfully breached registration databases and
attempted, but failed, to alter and delete voting records.\7\ In
Arizona, hackers successfully installed malware on a county election
official's computer.\8\ Russian hackers also targeted at least one
election vendor with the hope of ultimately obtaining access into
numerous State and local voter registration databases.\9\ If these
attacks had been successful, hackers would have been able to alter or
delete voter registration records, causing a great deal of chaos on
Election Day and potentially swaying the results of the election.

The single most urgent need is for States using paperless machines
to replace their outdated equipment with paper ballot voting systems.
The Brennan Center estimates that cost to replace paperless voting
machines would be between $130 and S400 million, and States do not have
the money to do this themselves.\10\ South Carolina is 1 of the 5
remaining States that relies exclusively on paperless machines, and a
spokesman for the South Carolina Election Commission recently told the
New York Times, ``We're using the same equipment we've used since 2004.
If $40 million dropped into our hands today, we'd have a paper ballot
trail, too.''\11\ In order to prevent future attacks, States also need
to hire IT staff to upgrade and maintain IT infrastructure, and train
election officials and poll workers on cybersecurity.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
State and local election officials are acutely aware that they need
to improve election security, but they lack the necessary funds to
safeguard their voting infrastructure.\12\ In most States, legislatures
are not increasing their election security budgets.\13\ In some cases,
Governors are actively undermining election security efforts. In
Florida, Governor Scott's budget proposed reducing the funding for the
Division of Elections by almost $1 million.\14\ In July, Governor
Kasich vetoed a provision in Ohio's budget that would have allocated $1
million toward voting equipment.\15\ Governor Walker issued a partial
veto to the State's budget, and in doing so, eliminated five jobs from
the Wisconsin Elections Commission.\16\ This issue is simply too
important to sit back and watch State governments and the Federal
Government pass responsibility back and forth.

Moreover, State and local officials have expressed a desire for
Congress to step in. In a recent Politico survey of State election
officials, 21 of 33 respondents want the Federal Government to
authorize funds for States to spend on replacing voting machines or
otherwise strengthening election security.\17\ In response to the
letter sent out by the Task Force to the chief election official in
each State asking how the Federal Government could help States with
election security, the National Association of Secretaries of States
replied by saying, `'States would clearly benefit from the
appropriation of the outstanding balance of Federal HAVA funds to aid
them in ensuring that they have sufficient equipment, technical
support, and resources to maintain a sound security posture for their
computer-based systems.''\18\

The money that States need can be appropriated right now. HAVA
authorized $3 billion dollars for States to upgrade and modernize their
election infrastructure in the wake of the chaotic 2000 Presidential
election. According to the Election Assistance Commission, the agency
charged with administering HAVA's grants, approximately $2.6 billion of
the HAVA funds have been distributed.\19\ Appropriating the remaining

When a sovereign nation attempts to meddle in our elections, it is
an attack on our country. We cannot leave States to defend against the
sophisticated cyber tactics of state actors like Russia on their own.
Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland Security wrote in The
Wall Street Journal, ``In an age of unprecedented cyber risks, these
dangers aren't surprising. But lawmakers and election officials'
lackadaisical response is both staggering and distressing . . . This is
a matter of National security, and Congress should treat it as such.''

Letter From Six Members of Congress
January 9, 2018.
The Honorable Paul D. Ryan,
Speaker of the House of Representatives, United States Capitol,
Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Mr. Speaker: January 6 marked 1 year since the Office of the
Director of National Intelligence released its ominous report
documenting Russia's multifaceted campaign to interfere in the 2016
elections and warning that Russia is likely to do it again.
Over the past year, our Nation has learned more about the breadth
and magnitude of Russia's growing threat against our democracy and our
National security. We now know that Russia used its influence to help
elect Donald Trump, sought to interfere in at least 21 State elections,
executed a propaganda campaign to manipulate and sow discord among the
American people, and hacked our Nation's critical infrastructure,
including U.S. electricity grids.
Since then, President Trump's former National Security Adviser,
Michael Flynn, and the President's former campaign policy adviser,
George Papadopoulos, both have pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about
their contacts with Russia. President Trump also fired James Comey, the
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, because he continued
to investigate the ``Russia thing'' while refusing to pledge his
loyalty to President Trump.
Russia's aggression toward the United States and the Trump
administration's efforts to cover up its communications with the
Russians demand an immediate, whole-of-Government response. Yet,
Republican House leaders and Committee Chairmen have blocked,
stonewalled, and rejected our basic requests to investigate, hold
public hearings, and advance legislation to address these matters.
House Republicans have chosen to put President Trump ahead of our
National interests.
Rather than pursue the truth on behalf of the American people,
House Republicans have waged an aggressive campaign to shut down
Congressional and criminal investigations into Russia's attack, they
have launched and re-launched investigations into baseless conspiracy
theories to deflect attention and resources, they have defamed our
Nation's top law enforcement and intelligence agencies, and they have
sought to discredit anyone seeking to uncover wrongdoing, including
Special Counsel Robert Mueller, a decorated war veteran.
To date, the House has held only one full committee public hearing
on the most significant finding of the ODNI report: That our elections
continue to be vulnerable to foreign interference in the future.
Instead, they have relegated this issue to a handful of toothless
subcommittee hearings, which have been marked by the Trump
administration's refusal to provide documents requested by Democrats
that would help inform our work, such as documents relating to Russia's
attempted attacks against 21 State election systems that are currently
being withheld by the Department of Homeland Security. Our country, our
democracy, and the American public deserve better.
As Members of Congress, we take a solemn oath to support and defend
the Constitution and protect the American people. The failure of House
Republicans to take strong and swift action in the face of Russia's
assault on our democracy is beneath the dignity of this oath. The
strength and integrity of our democracy, the rule of law, and our
democratic institutions hang in the balance.
We ask you to change course and begin demonstrating true leadership
on this critical National security issue. We request that House
Republicans join us in fulfilling our sworn Constitutional duty by
ensuring that each committee of jurisdiction thoroughly investigates
the following key questions:
How were Russian hackers able to penetrate our State
election systems, and how do we protect our elections
infrastructure in advance of upcoming elections this year and
beyond?
What vulnerabilities remain in our electrical grids and
infrastructure networks, and what can we be doing to ensure our
safety and security?
How was social media leveraged to influence voters, and what
can be done to ensure that American voters know where their
information is coming from?
What was the extent of the Trump campaign's involvement in
Russia's operation to hack and disseminate material damaging to
Hillary Clinton?
In light of President Trump's refusal to release his tax
returns, what is the extent of his and his family's business
and financial ties to Russians, and how might those ties
constitute leverage over the President and his family?
In light of Attorney General Jeff Sessions' testimony in
October that the Trump administration is not doing enough to
stop future Russian interference and that ``the matter is so
complex that for most of us we are not able to fully grasp the
technical dangers that are out there,'' what steps has the
Trump administration taken to hold Russia accountable for its
attack and ensure the safety of our elections from foreign
interference?
Why is the Trump administration dragging its feet on
implementing the sanctions against Russia that were adopted by
Congress with widespread bipartisan support?
What are the extent and nature of efforts by the Trump
administration to impede criminal and Congressional
investigations into the Trump campaign's involvement and
support for Russian interference into our elections?
We are extremely concerned by the intelligence community's warning
that Russia may attempt to interfere with future elections--including
the upcoming mid-term elections--and we are deeply troubled by the lack
of action by the Trump administration and House Republicans in
responding to this core threat to our democracy.
We ask you to review this request and to schedule a meeting with
leaders of both parties so we may work together to respond to the
matters of serious concern raised in this letter. Thank you for your
consideration of these requests.
Sincerely,
Congressman Eliot Engel,
Ranking Member of the Foreign Affairs Committee.

Letter From Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson
February 16, 2018.
Chairman Michael T. McCaul,
Committee on Homeland Security, H2-l76 Ford House Office Building,
Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Chairman McCaul: I am writing to express my continued concern
about election security and Russian interference in our election
systems. I ask that you to take urgent action by holding a hearing on
this important homeland security issue and marking up recently-
introduced legislation to protect our election systems, H.R. 5011, the
Election Security Act. Both actions should be taken without delay as
the first election of the 2018 season will take place in your home
State of Texas on March 6, 2018.
In November 2016, 139 million Americans cast their votes in the
wake of a massive Russian cyber-enabled influence operation designed to
undermine faith in American democracy, exposing serious National
security vulnerabilities in our election infrastructure.
In response, on January 6, 2017, then-Secretary of Homeland
Security Jeh Johnson designated election infrastructure as a critical
infrastructure subsector, citing its importance to our National
interests. The same day, the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence (ODNI) released a declassified report entitled
``Background to Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent
US Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution''
that concluded the Kremlin would use lessons from its 2016 elections
operations to influence future elections world-wide. Similarly, in
March 2017, dudng a hearing before the House Permanent Select Committee
on Intelligence, then-Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director
James Comey warned that Russia would use its experience from the 2016
elections to attempt to influence upcoming U.S. elections.
Recognizing the alarming conclusions of our National security and
intelligence agencies and on-going reports of our foreign adversaries'
intentions, on May 23, 2017, I wrote to you to request a Committee on
Homeland Security investigation into Russian interference in our
elections. While this committee failed to take action, Government
officials continued to sound the alarm. At the Aspen Security Forum in
July 2017, the Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the
Central Intelligence Agency, the former Secretary of Homeland Security,
and the White House's Homeland Security Advisor all agreed that Russian
entities targeted the 2016 elections. Additionally, in July 2017, a
Department of Homeland Security official testified before the Senate
Select Committee on Intelligence that State election systems were
targeted by nefarious Russian actors. Even after it came to light that
almost half of U.S. States had been targeted by the Russians, including
States Members of the Committee on Homeland Security call home, our
committee did not have a single noticed activity on the issue.
Absent action on my request, on June 29, 2017, I joined with
colleagues from the Committee on Homeland Security and the Committee on
House Administration to form the Congressional Task Force on Election
Security. Earlier this week, after months of engagement with State
election officials, security experts, and other stakeholders, the Task
Force released a comprehensive report with findings and recommendations
and unveiled the Election Security Act, which is aimed at bolstering
protections for upcoming U.S. elections.
The Task Force's report comes on the heels of still more warnings
from U.S. Government officials that Russia seeks to interfere with our
upcoming elections. Indeed, a week prior to the release of our report,
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson stated that Russia is already trying
to interfere in the 2018 midterm elections. On February 13, the day
prior to the release of the Task Force's final report, 6 current
intelligence officials--the Director of National Intelligence, the
Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Director of the FBI,
the Director of the National Security Agency, the Director of the
Defense Intelligence Agency, and the Director of the National
Geospatial Intelligence Agency--unanimously agreed that the 2018
elections are a potential target for Russian operations.
Given the seriousness of this threat to our Nation, Congress must
redouble its efforts to thwart foreign influences seeking to interfere
in our elections. The Committee on Homeland Security should have acted
long ago. With less than 10 legislative days prior to the first primary
election of the year, it is critical that we hold a hearing to examine
this National security issue and consider the Election Security Act
without delay. We owe it to the American public to act. I look forward
to working with you to secure our Nation's elections and our democracy.
Sincerely,
Bennie G. Thompson,
Ranking Member.

Letter From Chairman Michael T. McCaul
February 21, 2018.
Ranking Member Bennie Thompson,
Committee on Homeland Security, H2-117 Ford House Office Building,
Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Ranking Member Thompson: Thank you for your February 16, 2018
letter. Russian interference in our electoral process and the
undermining of our democratic institutions by a foreign adversary must
never be tolerated. That is why I am proud of our bipartisan efforts to
pass the first ever, comprehensive reauthorization of the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS). Specifically, I am glad we adopted an
amendment that prioritizes and requires DHS to provide voluntary
assistance to State and local election officials in recognition of the
importance of election infrastructure. Not only did we pass this bill
unanimously through our committee, it passed through the House with
overwhelming bipartisan support last July by a vote of 386-41.
It is imperative that we continue to ensure DHS has the most
efficient and robust structure possible to help thwart all cyber
adversaries. The bipartisan Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security
Agency Act of 2017, which I introduced and you co-sponsored, elevates
and operationalizes the Department's cybersecurity and infrastructure
protection offices, helping to ensure stronger mission execution which
is so integral to our shared concerns. This bill also sailed through
the House with support from both parties. The Senate should follow our
lead and get these bills to the President's desk.
While recognizing Russian interference in our election in October
of 2016, I called on President Obama to ``send a clear signal to
Moscow: attempts to influence U.S. elections or interfere with our
democratic system will be met with severe consequences.'' Since that
time, I have remained consistent on the seriousness of this threat.
Just last week, I called for the extradition of Russians who had been
indicted for election interference, so they could be ``held accountable
and prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.'' Clearly, these kinds
of attacks transcend partisan politics.
I want to encourage all Members of the committee to raise this
vital issue when Secretary Nielsen appears before the committee during
our March budget hearing. In addition, it is my goal to have the Under
Secretary of the National Protection and Programs Directorate, once
confinned, appear before the committee to discuss this, and other key
cyber issues, in classified and unclassified settings.
I look forward to working with you to protect the integrity and
transparency of our American democracy.
Sincerely,
Michael T. McCaul,
Chairman.

and Ranking Member Quigley: We write to express strong support for the
Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and to respectfully request that
the EAC receive $14 million so it can continue to assist States in
their urgent efforts to secure voting systems in advance of the 2018
midterm elections. In addition, we request that you appropriate $400
million under the Help America Vote Act of 2002 (HAVA) for States to
use to replace aging and vulnerable voting machines and to provide
cybersecurity training.\1\ Intelligence officials continue to warn that
our State-based electoral system is a target for foreign meddling and
cyber attacking, and we believe this money is necessary to protect
American elections against the possibility of imminent attack.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The EAC is the only Federal agency charged with making American
elections more secure, accessible, accurate, and transparent. It has
built strong relationships with State and local election officials as
well as cybersecurity experts, and has been vital to helping States
understand and respond to the threats confronting their election
infrastructure. The EAC has worked diligently, with a bare-bones
budget, over the past few years to provide guidance on cybersecurity
and election technology. But at this critical time, the Commission
needs additional resources to fully respond to the needs of the States.
Providing the EAC with additional funds would enable them to hire
two additional staffers whose exclusive responsibilities would be to
work directly with State and local election officials, as well as
cybersecurity experts, on improving cybersecurity. In addition, the
agency could hire two additional researchers to develop best practices
on cybersecurity and risk-limiting audits, and to create materials to
train election officials and poll workers on security issues. The EAC
would also be able to hold a summit to bring together computer
scientists, ``white hat'' hackers, and academics to examine election
technologies and expose any vulnerabilities before the equipment is put
to use. Finally, the EAC could increase the amount of funds it
transfers to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
to $2.5 million which would enable NIST to provide further technical
expertise on voting machine standards.
Furthermore, States need an additional $400 million in grants under
HAVA to be appropriated so they can safeguard their voting
infrastructure. The single most urgent need is for States using
paperless machines to replace their outdated equipment with paper
ballot voting systems. The Brennan Center estimates that the cost to
replace paperless voting machines is between $130 and $400 million, and
States do not have the money to do it themselves.\3\ Moreover, State
and local officials have expressed a desire for Congress to step in. ln
December 2017, the National Association of Secretaries of States (NASS)
called upon Congress to provide the States with the remaining HAVA
funds. President of NASS and Indiana Secretary of State Connie Lawson
said, ``The challenges faced by State and local election officials in
2017 are quite different from those we faced in 2002.''\4\

2017). NASS Calls on Congress to Provide the Remaining $396 Million in
Outstanding HAVA Funds. [Press release].
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Appropriating a new round of HAVA grants would not address all
security concerns. As you may know, the Congressional Task Force on
Election Security found that States need funding to hire IT staff,
upgrade and maintain IT infrastructure, implement risk limiting audits,
develop more secure election technology, and for cybersecurity
training. Toward that end, its legislative proposal requests a total of
$1.8 billion--half of the amount initially authorized to fight hanging
chads in HAVA--over 10 years to replace all non-secure voting machines,
maintain and upgrade elections systems, provide on-going cybersecurity
training, help States implement risk limiting audits, and invest in
innovative election technology. But the $400 million already authorized
would allow States to address their biggest vulnerability by replacing
paperless voting machines and would represent an important down payment
on tackling this long-term National security challenge.
We cannot leave States to their own devices in defending against
the sophisticated cyber tactics of foreign governments. An attack on
the electoral infrastructure in one State is an attack on all of
democracy in America. Michael Chertoff, former Secretary of Homeland
Security, and Grover Norquist wrote in The Washington Post, ``It's not
practical to expect local election administrators in rural Missouri or
small-town Maine to go toe-to-toe with the premier government-backed
cyber mercenaries in China or North Korea. Just as Federal agencies
prudently provide support for State law enforcement in dealing with
terrorism, Federal officials should give guidance and support in
dealing with the election cybersecurity threat.''
We urge you to fully fund HAVA and provide the EAC with the support
it needs so that the Federal Government can meaningfully assist States
in securing our election systems.

Letter From Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson
March 12, 2018.
The Honorable Michael T. McCaul,
Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC 20515.
Dear Mr. Chairman: I am pleased that on Wednesday, March 7, you
publicly announced that the committee would commence efforts to address
two homeland security issues--election security and school security. On
the subject of election security, I was pleased to hear you express
that you share concerns that I, along with my Democratic colleagues on
the committee, have repeatedly expressed about the prospect that
Vladimir Putin's cyber hackers continue to pose a threat to our
election infrastructure and that the 2018 elections are a target.
Further, you informed the committee that on March 6 you sent a request
for a Classified briefing from the Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) on the cybersecurity threats facing State election systems. I
request that this Classified briefing be an official noticed activity.
You also indicated that you intend to notice a public hearing dedicated
to receiving testimony on election security from Federal Government
witnesses as soon as possible. There are just 8 legislative days left
until the next Congressional work period. As such, I would appreciate
information on the projected time line for holding both the election
security briefing and hearing.
With respect to school security, I was heartened to hear you
acknowledge that school security is a homeland security issue. I was
also pleased to hear you express interest to move forward, on a
bipartisan basis, with school security legislation in this committee.
However, I am disappointed that consideration of H.R. 4627, the
``Shielding Public Spaces from Vehicular Terrorism Act'' was postponed.
As such, a timely amendment Rep. Val Demings (D-FL) authored,
addressing the risk that President Trump could direct DHS to abandon a
long-standing prohibition on Federal homeland security grant
expenditures on guns to allow such purchases for teachers, did not get
considered. While I was pleased to hear you acknowledge that this
prohibition is a long-standing DHS policy, I was perplexed to learn
that the Majority needs more time to seek more infmmation to ``properly
vet'' the amendment, given that no outreach was made to Rep. Demings or
my staff since Monday, March 5 at 10 a.m., when the amendment was filed
as required under the committee notice. Action on the Demings
legislation is necessary, given that the President recently expressed
support for Federal funding to be provided to cover firearms training
for K-12 educators.
We would welcome the opportunity to work on a bipartisan basis to
make our Nation's schools more secure to terrorism, active shootings,
and other threats, as you expressed was your goal. We stand ready to
work with you on such legislation, and we would appreciate greater
detail when you expect to take up H.R. 4627 with concern to your goals,
timing-wise, for bipartisan school security legislation.
Further, I believe the bipartisan school security legislative
effort could be bolstered by the committee holding a hearing outside of
the Capitol. To that end, I would highlight that on March 6, Emergency
Preparedness, Response, and Communications (EPRC) Ranking Member,
Donald M. Payne, Jr. (D-NJ), submitted a request for a field hearing to
conduct oversight on DHS's effort to improve school security and
preparedness in his New Jersey Congressional district. As you know,
Ranking Member Payne's interest in this homeland security issue dates
back to 2013, when he introduced the ``SAFE in Our Schools Act'' (H.R.
3158).
Election security and school security demand urgent action.
Accordingly, I look forward to getting a more detailed picture of your
specific plans for committee action on these homeland security
challenges, as sought above. Together, I believe we can, in a
bipartisan way, make our children, constituents, communities, and this
democracy more secure.
To coordinate such effort, please do not hesitate to have your
staff contact my staff director, Hope Goins.
Thank you.
Bennie G. Thompson,
Ranking Member.

In The News--Keeping the Vote Cybersafe
Aug 13, 2016, The New York Times
To the Editor:
In ``U.S. Seeking Ways to Keep Hackers Out of Ballot Box'' (news
article, Aug. 4), Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says the
Obama administration is discussing giving extra protections to the
Nation's electoral system. This change may be necessary and should be
considered immediately.
The diverse nature of the cyber threat, and the recent revelation
that outside actors, possibly nation-states, have an increased interest
in influencing our elections, make it imperative that the Federal
Government give additional attention to securing our electoral system
and possibly deem it part of our Nation's critical infrastructure.
Without delay, Mr. Johnson should communicate with the thousands of
jurisdictions in the country that help carry out elections and offer
the Department of Homeland Security's assistance, expertise, and
guidance. While the diverse and varied nature of our voting
infrastructure confounds efforts to secure it, this tells us that the
process should begin as soon as possible.

Press Release--Thompson, Smith, Cummings, Conyers, Engel, Hoyer, Schiff
Joint Statement Calling for a Comprehensive Investigation of Russian
Interference in the 2016 Election
Dec. 13, 2016
(WASHINGTON).--Today, House Armed Services Committee Ranking Member
Adam Smith (D-WA), House Oversight Committee Ranking Member Elijah
Cummings (D-MD), House Judiciary Committee Ranking Member John Conyers
(D-MI), House Foreign Affairs Committee Ranking Member Eliot Engel (D-
NY), House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD), House Intelligence
Committee Ranking Member Adam Schiff (D-CA), and Homeland Security
Committee Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS) released the
following joint statement in response to news reports about
intelligence assessments of Russian interference in the 2016 election,
and comments by the House Republican leadership downplaying the need
for a thorough investigation:
``All Americans should be deeply concerned by the reports that Russian
agencies have interfered with a U.S. election. As Speaker Ryan noted,
`any foreign intervention in our elections is entirely unacceptable.'
``The first duty of the United States Government is to safeguard the
American people and the integrity of our free society from attacks by
foreign adversaries. Cyber attacks on our political institutions are
direct threats to their integrity and are just as menacing as attacks
on our economic, physical, and military infrastructure.
``Given the gravity of these unprecedented attacks by a foreign state,
we need a Congressional investigation that is truly bipartisan, that is
comprehensive, that will not be restricted by jurisdictional lines, and
that will give the American people a complete and full accounting of
what happened consistent with safeguarding our National security.''

Press Release--Congress Must Protect Electoral Systems & Preserve
Election Assistance Commission
dhs promises to help states protect systems as house gop votes to
eliminate commission
Feb. 8, 2017
(WASHINGTON).--Yesterday, the Committee on House Administration
voted on party lines to eliminate the independent Election Assistance
Commission. The EAC was created to help States upgrade voting
technology and promote critical election-related information sharing.
Having up-to-date voting machine technology is critical to ensure they
are protected from any potential hacking, tampering, or fraud.
This inexplicable move willfully ignores the present-day threats to
election infrastructure. In fact, yesterday, Homeland Security
Secretary John Kelly stated to Congress: ``I believe we should help all
of the States, provide them as much help as we can to make sure their
systems are protected in future elections'' [VIDEO of exchange with
Rep. Cedric Richmond]. He also noted that protecting the Nation's
electoral systems should be a priority under the National
Infrastructure Protection Plan. Additionally, President Trump has said
that our election systems were compromised in the 2016 election and
millions illegitimately voted. Those allegations are reported to be
investigated by the White House under a commission that lacks the
independence of the EAC.
Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking Member of the Homeland
Security Committee, released the following statement on the change:
``The danger of cyber attacks from state and non-state actors is
constantly escalating and evolving and Americans must be confident that
we are addressing this threat. Congress cannot abdicate this
responsibility while the President sends Federal investigators on a
wild goose chase to search for millions and millions of non-existent
illegal votes. Given public unease regarding Russia's extensive
interference with the recent Presidential election, Congress should be
doing more, not less, to ensure the integrity of our electoral systems.
Our legitimacy as Congress is only as legitimate as strength and
security of the ballot box. This is a shameful, partisan move by House
Republicans that undermines our democracy.''
Rep. Cedric L. Richmond (D-LA), Ranking Member of the Subcommittee
on Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Protection, added the following:
``Voting is a fundamental right and the foundation of our democracy and
it is essential that we maintain confidence in the integrity of the
ballot box. Now that constant cyber attacks are our new reality, taking
the appropriate security measures is more important than ever. If we
are serious about protecting our electoral process we need to continue
to make smart investments like the EAC that will help us reach that
goal.''

In The News--Independent Commission Must Investigate President Trump's
Potential Russian Ties
Feb. 27, 2017, BlackPressUSA
The endurance of our Nation's security, sovereignty, and democracy
is not a partisan issue. This is a top concern for all Americans and
should be a top priority for the leaders that we send to Washington,
whether Democrat or Republican. As elected officials, my colleagues and
I swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States
against all enemies, foreign and domestic. We, therefore, have a
responsibility to do our due diligence in investigating Russian
interference, and potential influence, into our democratic elections
and the potential Russian on-going connections within this current
Presidential administration.
Despite all of the evidence gathered thus far--evidence that has
led all 17 of the U.S. intelligence agencies to conclude with
confidence that the Russians had indeed interfered in the past
election--the current administration seems unable or unwilling to put
its full weight behind a full and proper investigation that seems
necessary to the American people. In the face of evidence that campaign
and administration officials seem to have had relationships with
Russian officials, the President cannot simply move on from this issue.
In fact, the resignation of National Security Advisor Michael Flynn
this month seems to provide us with more questions than answers.
The potential conflicts between the Trump administration and its
apparent ties to Russia seem numerous. The President has refused to
release his tax returns--a move not seen from any other modern major
party candidate--leaving questions unanswered as to potential Russian
business ties and conflicts of interest that President Trump was all
too happy to gloat about in years past. The President is unable to
criticize Russia and its dictator-like leader Vladimir Putin, but,
instead, praises him and prefers him to President Obama. When
confronted with the assertion that Putin has had journalists and
political opponents killed, President Trump doubled down on his support
of Putin by shockingly asserting a moral equivalence between Russia and
the United States.
The President's ties to Russia don't end with him, however, they
trickle down into his administration. As in the campaign, President
Trump continues to surround himself with advisers that have expansive
and well-documented financial entanglements to Russia. Recently, The
New York Times reported that phone records show Trump associates
communicated with senior Russian intelligence officials throughout the
campaign, including his former campaign chair Paul Manafort, who is
known to have involvements in multimillion-dollar business deals with
Putin allies in Ukraine. Additionally, Michael Flynn was forced to
resign following information revealing that he had lied about privately
discussing U.S. sanctions against Russia with the Russian ambassador to
the United States before Trump took office, a potentially illegal act.
It has since been reported that White House officials were made aware
of Flynn's actions and made no effort to correct the record. It was
only after leaks to the public that President Trump's hand was forced,
raising concerns regarding the ability of this White House to maintain
honest and open communication with the American people.
This intricate web leaves us with critical questions that must be
answered. What did the President know and when? Was the White House
ignoring or covering up the truth and spreading misinformation? Did
Flynn operate at the direction or the knowledge of the President and
were others involved? The American people deserve to know the full
extent of Russia's financial, personal, and political strings attached
to President Trump and this administration.
Now more than ever, we need an independent, bipartisan commission
to fully investigate Russia's interference in the election and any
potential Trump campaign ties to the Kremlin. Unfortunately, Republican
leaders in the House seem less than enthusiastic about investigating
their own President. In turn, last month, Representatives Eric Swalwell
(D-CA), and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) reintroduced legislation that would
create a 12-member, bipartisan, independent commission empowered to
conduct an in-depth investigation into attempts by the Russian
government or others to use electronic means to influence, interfere
with, or undermine trust in last year's elections. This would be
similar to the highly-praised 9/11 Commission--which was led by well-
regarded National security experts that were not elected officials.
Such a commission is not only necessary in order to ensure our
security, but to restore trust in this administration and in the
democratic process. All Democratic Members of the House of
Representatives, along with one Republican, have co-sponsored this
critical bipartisan legislation.
The American people deserve transparency and peace of mind when it
comes to their elected leadership. The Trump administration has
insisted on remaining friendly with Russia despite the very clear
threat that they have presented to our National security. In doing so,
they have put our Nation at risk while keeping American citizens in the
dark. The Trump administration's intent to ignore these on-going acts
of aggression sends a message that this type of meddling is acceptable.
The only democratic way forward is to launch a complete investigation
into not only the interference into our democratic election, but also
into the ties and communication that this administration has had with
Russia.

Press Release--AG Sessions Must Prioritize Election Hacking
Investigation After Yahoo Indictments
March 15, 2017
(WASHINGTON).--Today, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking
Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, released the following
statement on news that the Justice Department announced the indictments
of two Russian spies and two criminal hackers in connection with the
2014 hack of Yahoo.
``Today's Justice Department indictment of two Russian-government
agents in the Kremlin's cyber division is a watershed moment in our
efforts to counter state-directed cyber hacking campaigns. Without
doubt, the tactics utilized in the Yahoo plot are a roadmap to how the
Kremlin carries out its cyber hacking campaigns. I call on Attorney
General Sessions to prioritize the investigation of the cyber hacking
campaign against our political institutions during the 2016 election
with an eye to indicting whoever in Vladimir Putin's government
directed this unprecedented attack on our democracy.''
______
Press Release--Pelosi, Thompson, Brady Announce Election Security Task
Force
June 29, 2017
(WASHINGTON).--Today, as the Nation prepares to celebrate July 4th,
House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Committee on Homeland Security
Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), and Committee on House
Administration Ranking Member Robert Brady (D-PA) announced the
formation of a Task Force to ensure the health and security of our
Nation's election systems.
The Congressional Task Force on Election Security will address the
lack of action to protect electoral infrastructure following Russia
interfering and attempting to influence the 2016 Presidential election.
According to the Department of Homeland Security, the election systems
in 21 States were breached and voter records containing personal
information were stolen. To this day, we have seen no action from the
Republican Congress or the Trump administration to provide greater
protection to our election systems.
The Congressional Task Force on Election Security is intended to be
a forum for Members from the two committees to hear from experts with
expertise in cybersecurity and election infrastructure and identify
policy recommendations that can help ensure the integrity of our
election systems and guard against future attacks.
Leader Pelosi released the following statement on the Task Force:
``The integrity of our democracy itself is under threat from the
Russians,'' said House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi. ``But we see an
appalling absence of action, or even concern, from President Trump and
Congressional Republicans. Democrats won't allow Putin's assault on
American democracy to go unchallenged. With our Task Force on Election
Security, House Democrats are continuing to pursue the facts and defend
our democracy where Republicans won't.''
Ranking Member Thompson added the following:
``Last year's Russian campaign to hack our political institutions and
interfere with the Presidential election was a blatant attack on our
democracy. If we continue to do nothing to protect the integrity of our
election systems, we make it easy for Russia and other nefarious actors
to impact future elections. Unfortunately, we have seen no effort from
the Republican-led Congress or the Trump administration to address this
vulnerability. Looking toward the future, we must be able to put
politics aside for the good of the country and work together to protect
against efforts to undermine our cherished democratic institutions. I
look forward to working with Ranking Member Brady and my colleagues to
get answers for the American people and prevent future damage to our
democracy.''
Ranking Member Brady added the following:
``We now know that Russia launched an unprecedented attack on our
election infrastructure, and the intelligence community has indicated
that foreign actors will be back in 2018 and 2020. Free, fair, and
secure elections are the cornerstone of our democracy, and Congress
must take action to address this threat to our election security, and
our National security. I look forward to working with my colleagues to
identify the vulnerabilities in our voting systems and to take action
to make our elections safer.''

Press Release--Election Security Task Force Receives First Briefing
July 27, 2017
(WASHINGTON).--The Congressional Task Force on Election Security,
chaired by Committee on Homeland Security Ranking Member Bennie G.
Thompson (D-MS) and Committee on House Administration Ranking Member
Robert Brady (D-PA) received its first information-gathering briefing
to inform its work on securing our election systems.
The Task Force was briefed by the Brennan Center For Justice on its
new report: Securing Elections From Foreign Interference. Brennan
Center experts offered specific actions Congress and local election
officials can quickly take to insulate voting technology from continued
foreign interference. Their report focuses on assessing and securing
two of the most vulnerable points in the system: voting machines, which
could be hacked to cast doubt on or change vote totals; and voter
registration databases, which could be manipulated in an attempt to
block voters, cause disruption, and undermine confidence when citizens
vote.
Co-Chairs Thompson and Brady released the below joint statement
following the briefing:
``Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and targeting of voting
infrastructure in at least 21 States was a direct attack on our
democracy. The American people expect their Government to do whatever
possible to prevent this from happening again. While Republicans refuse
to look into this issue, we are taking the steps to begin an
investigation into what we can do to secure our election infrastructure
and prevent what transpired last year from happening again. The Brennan
Center's expertise on election issues will lend us to our first public
meeting in the coming weeks where we will hear from officials and
experts with diverse backgrounds. This will be the first step toward
forming solutions to protect our democracy and its cherished
institutions from malicious actors and outside influence.''

Press Release--Thompson Statement on DHS Notifying States of Election
Targeting
September 22, 2017
(WASHINGTON).--Today, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking
Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, released the following
statement on the news that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
has notified each State and territory whether or not their election
systems were targeted during the 2016 election:
``Russia's priority in undermining confidence in our democratic
institutions was clear during last year election and will only growing
stronger. To counter this, there must be a strong relationship between
DHS and its partners at the State level with the aim of keeping our
election systems--part of our critical infrastructure--secure. While
this should have happened much sooner, I am glad that DHS finally
notified each State whether or not they were targeted by Russia. I urge
DHS to keep building trusted relationships with State governments to
carry out its responsibility to help States secure their election
systems. Congress must also continue to do its part to investigate what
happened last year, work to prevent it in the future, and ensure DHS
has the resources it needs to protect these systems.''

Public Forum Thursday
September 26, 2017/September 27, 2017
(WASHINGTON).--On Thursday, September 28th, the Congressional Task
Force on Election Security, will hold its first public forum:
``Securing America's Elections: Understanding the Threat.'' The task
force will hear from Jeh Johnson, former Homeland Security Secretary,
and Suzanne Spaulding, former DHS Under Secretary for the National
Protection and Programs Directorate.
Details: Congressional Task Force on Election Security Forum
``Securing America's Elections: Understanding the Threat'' 11 a.m.

The Congressional Task Force on Election Security was created this
summer to address the lack of action to protect electoral
infrastructure following Russia interfering and attempting to influence
the 2016 Presidential election. It is chaired by Committee on Homeland
Security Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS) and Committee on
House Administration Ranking Member Robert Brady (D-PA).
Co-Chairs Thompson and Brady released the below joint statement
announcing the forum:
``Recent news reminds us that Russia targeted voting infrastructure in
at least 21 States last year in a direct attack on our democracy.
Looking forward, the American people expect us to investigate our
vulnerabilities and do whatever possible to prevent this from happening
again. While Republican leaders in Congress refuse to investigate, we
have decided to take initiative to start a process to provide answers
on how we can better secure our election infrastructure and prevent
election meddling in the future.''

Press Release--Election Security Task Force Releases Preliminary
Recommendations
November 15, 2017
(WASHINGTON).--The Congressional Task Force on Election Security,
chaired by Committee on Homeland Security Ranking Member Bennie G.
Thompson (D-MS) and Committee on House Administration Ranking Member
Robert Brady (D-PA) released its preliminary findings and
recommendations marking 1 year since the 2016 election. Because of
Republican inaction, the Task Force was created this summer to put
forth solutions to secure our election systems after Russia interfered
and attempted to influence last year's election. Just yesterday,
Attorney General Jeff Sessions admitted to Congress that he could not
report on any administration election security efforts.
Over the past 5 months, the Task Force has held public forums with
election and cybersecurity experts and has been working to understand
the threats to election infrastructure and how to address them. The 5
findings and 6 recommendations released today underline the Department
of Homeland Security and the Election Assistance Commission as the
primary agencies that can help States better secure their election
systems. Today's preliminary findings will inform an upcoming final
task force report.
Preliminary recommendations:
Maintain the designation of election infrastructure as a
critical infrastructure subsector.
Help States fund and maintain secure election systems.
States should conduct post-election risk-limiting audits.
Empower Federal agencies to be effective partners for
Nation-wide security reforms.
Establish clear and effective channels for sharing threat
and intelligence information with election officials.
Prioritize cybersecurity training at the State and local
level.
Congressman Thompson and Congressman Brady released the following
statement:
``One year ago, 139 million Americans cast their vote in the wake of a
massive Russian cyber-enabled influence operation designed to undermine
confidence in our democracy. Russia also targeted voter registration
databases in at least 21 States and sought to infiltrate the networks
of voting equipment vendors, political parties, and at least one local
election board. If we do nothing, this will become our new normal. With
the next Federal election only 1 year away, it is high time we start
thinking about enacting real solutions. The findings and
recommendations released today are an outline of concrete steps that we
can take to ensure our elections are more secure going forward.''

Press Release--Election Security Task Force Seeks Clarification On DHS
Role in Continuing Kobach Voter Fraud Commission
January 23, 2018
Despite no evidence of voter fraud, President Trump ordered DHS to
examine nonexistent Commission findings and ``determine next course of
action''
(WASHINGTON).--Today, House Homeland Security Committee Ranking
Member Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS) and Committee on House Administration
Ranking Member Robert A. Brady (D-PA), Co-Chairs of the Congressional
Task Force on Election Security, wrote to Department of Homeland
Security (DHS) Secretary Kristjen Nielsen seeking clarification
regarding the Department's responsibilities related to the now-defunct
Presidential Commission on Election Integrity.
The Commission was ostensibly established to investigate
allegations of fraudulent voter registrations and fraudulent voting.
However, the Members write this claim was substantiated by ``nothing
more than the President's active imagination and frustration that he
did not receive the majority of the popular votes cast in the 2016
Presidential election.'' The letter notes the Commission was the
subject of frequent criticism and legal action ``alleging violation of
several Federal laws, including the Fifth Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution, the Privacy Act, the Hatch Act, and multiple State laws,
among other things.''
After the commission was unable to produce any evidence of improper
voting and registrations, the President abruptly terminated the
commission. However, he nevertheless directed DHS to ``examine'' the
Commission's initial findings and ``determine the next courses of
action.''
The Members write:
``It is unclear how the Department will carry out this charge given
that the Commission never produced any findings. We are concerned that
directing DHS essentially to take over where the Commission left off
could distract the Department from its pressing obligation to protect
U.S. election systems from foreign interference and may undermine the
burgeoning relationships DHS is building with State election
officials.''
The Members request that DHS provide the following information
related to their examination:
Any documents, files, electronic records, or information
that the Department has received or anticipates receiving from
the Commission, despite reports that all voter data will be
destroyed and that the Commission never made any findings.
What activities the Department will undertake pursuant to
the President's decision to transfer the Commission's
responsibilities to DHS, including whether those additional
activities will require the Department to divert resources from
existing activities.
What steps the Department plans to take in order to avoid
undermining the cooperative relationship between DHS and the
States necessary to secure our Nation's elections.

Press Release--Election Security Task Force Chairs Release Statement on
Secretary Tillerson Comments on Russia Already Interfering in This
Year's Elections
February 8, 2018
(WASHINGTON).--Today, House Homeland Security Committee Ranking
Member Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS) and Committee on House Administration
Ranking Member Robert A. Brady (D-PA), Co-Chairs of the Congressional
Task Force on Election Security, released the below joint statement in
reaction to Secretary of State Tillerson's comments on Russia already
interfering in this year's elections.
``Secretary Tillerson confirmed what Congressional Democrats have known
since the ODNI released its report on election meddling: Russia is
determined to interfere in our elections and disrupt our democratic
processes. His candid admission that we are no better prepared to stop
them than we were in 2016 is a testament to President Trump's failure
to acknowledge that Russia interfered in our elections once and is
determined to do so again. His unwillingness to counter the threat
should be appalling to all concerned Americans.''
``While Republicans in Congress have turned a blind eye, the Trump
administration seems to do Putin's bidding. Congressional Democrats,
however, have spent the last year identifying vulnerabilities in our
election systems and figuring out what we need to do to secure them.
Next week, the Congressional Task Force on Election Security, which we
chair, will be releasing its final report, recommendations, and new
legislation to give our elections systems a much-needed update.''
``Congress fought hard to protect the integrity of elections against
hanging chads 15 years ago, and certainly we should act to protect our
elections from the Russian government today. It's time for Republicans
to wake up and join us in protecting our democracy from Putin.''
The Election Security Task Force wrote the House Appropriations
Committee last November stressing the need to appropriate the remaining
$400 million already authorized for election infrastructure under the
Help America Vote Act for States to use to help secure their elections
systems.

Press Release--Brady, Thompson: Trump Abdicating His Oath of Office By
Refusing to Act on Election Security
February 27, 2018
(WASHINGTON).--Today, the Co-Chairs of the Congressional Task Force
on Election Security, House Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member
Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS) and Committee on House Administration Ranking
Member Robert A. Brady (D-PA), released the below joint statement on
the need for election security measures following Admiral Mike Rogers'
testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee today. At the
hearing, the National Security Agency (NSA) Director and U.S. Cyber
Command Commander told Senators that President Trump has not given him
orders to counter Russian interference in our elections.
``It is unimaginable that the President of the United States has not
ordered NSA Director Rogers--or apparently the heads of any other
agency--to stop Russia from meddling in our elections. This is a clear
invitation for Putin to continue to do what he pleases with American
sovereignty and our democratic institutions. Let us be clear: This
inaction is the President abdicating his oath of office. While spending
time on Twitter falsely alleging a witch hunt, he is not keeping the
country safe and secure.
``With a President unwilling or unable to put the country and its
security first, Congress must act. We call on Republicans and Democrats
to come together and pass clearly-needed election security reforms. The
Congressional Task Force on Election Security introduced legislation
earlier this month--H.R. 5011, the Election Security Act--that would
provide assistance to States to help secure their elections systems and
protect our democratic institutions from Russian efforts to undermine
them. We hope that our Republican colleagues can join us and put
politics aside so we secure our elections--the hallmark of our
democracy--from Russian interference.''

Press Release--House Democrats Call on Republican Congress to Uphold
their Oath of Office & Protect Elections from Russian Attacks
March 6, 2018
(WASHINGTON).--Today, March 6--at the start of the 2018 election
season--House Democrats are holding a press conference to release a new
letter to the Appropriations Committee Republican leadership calling
for necessary funds to protect our Nation's on-going elections from the
threat of repeated Russian attacks.
It has been over a year since Russia's unprecedented assault on the
country's elections in 2016--including targeting 21 States' voting
systems. These attacks exposed serious National security
vulnerabilities to our election infrastructure--which includes voting
machines and voter registration databases. Since that time, the Trump
administration and Republican leadership in Congress--despite their
oath of office to protect against enemies foreign and domestic--have
refused to address the issue or put forth any solutions to close these
security gaps, inviting Russia to interfere in our elections again.

Press Release--Thompson Demands Election Security Hearings After
Homeland Security Chairman Backtracks
March 21, 2018
(WASHINGTON).--Today, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking
Member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, released the
following statement after receiving written notice from Committee
Chairman Michael McCaul (R-TX) that he will not convene a hearing
dedicated to election security as he indicated publicly on March 7.
While promising to work with Democrats on this issue as soon as
possible, Chairman McCaul said: ``I look forward to working with you to
conducting a full hearing on this issue as it not only impacted--was a
real event in the last Presidential election--but I believe it will be
a real event in the mid-term 2018 elections.'' Today, Homeland Security
Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen testified before the Senate Intelligence
Committee that our elections are ``clearly potential targets for
Russian hacking attempts.''
``I am extremely disappointed that Chairman McCaul has already
backtracked on his public promise to hold a much-needed hearing on
election security and the on-going Russia cyber threat. This also comes
after repeated overtures last year to work together on this issue.
Alas, we have made no progress. To be clear, we first began hearing of
Russia's interference in our elections almost 2 years ago.''
``Chairman McCaul often reiterates his opposition to Russia, but
actions speak louder than words. Like Speaker Ryan and his fellow House
Chairmen, he is ensuring the House stays true in its partisanship and
seems too willing to do President Trump's bidding. Homeland security
used to be a bipartisan issue, but it seems this is no longer possible
when one party refuses to put the country--and its security--first.''
``Holding a focused and comprehensive hearing on election security
is not a partisan or complicated request. It speaks volumes that while
Chairman McCaul has been dragging his feet on this issue for over a
year, the Senate is holding election security hearings today with
current and former homeland security officials. This is all we are
asking for. I call on Chairman McCaul to realize his error and follow
through on his promise.''
``If Chairman McCaul believes Russia will interfere in the 2018
elections, as he has stated, we cannot ignore this threat. Having
hearings on election security--while developing solutions and showing
the public that we are working together on this issue is a solid first
step. The 2018 elections are only 7 months away and we must be doing
much more to protect them. If we do nothing, we are just inviting Putin
to what he pleases with our democracy and our domestic affairs.''

Press Release--Thompson to Speaker Ryan: Election Security Briefing
Insufficient
May 15, 2018
(WASHINGTON).--Today, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking
Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, and Co-Chair of the
Congressional Task Force on Election Security, released the following
statement on news that Speaker Ryan has announced an election security
briefing for Members of Congress:
``Unfortunately, due to it being in an unclassified setting, it is not
possible for this last-minute briefing scheduled by House Republicans
on election security to be able to go into the detail necessary to
properly educate Members of Congress on the Trump administration's
efforts--or lack thereof--to secure our election systems from foreign
interference. House Republicans have treated election security as a
third-rung issue for over a year, it is time for them to finally take
this National security issue seriously. The next Federal election is
less than 6 months away.''

Press Release--Thompson: Shocking Secretary Nielsen Hasn't Read 2017
Intel Assessment, Isn't Aware Russia Helped Trump
May 22, 2018
(WASHINGTON).--Today, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking
Member of the Committee on Homeland Security, released the following
statement on Homeland Security Nielsen's alarming comments after the
House of Representative's election security briefing today:
``I was shocked to hear that Secretary Nielsen has apparently not
bothered to read the January 2017 intelligence community assessment
that Russia interfered in our elections and undermined our democratic
process to help President Trump win. This report is over a year old,
has stood the test of time, was agreed to by the entire intelligence
community, and was backed up by Senate investigators. The fact that she
did not seem aware of the report's findings while briefing Members of
Congress on the very important topic of election security is appalling
to all who have tried to make progress on this issue since 2016 with
little help from Republicans or this administration. I sincerely hope
the Secretary's comments today were not just rhetorical gymnastics to
placate the President.
``Even though this report is widely available, I will be sure to
deliver the Secretary a copy. After today's briefing, it is clear that
our Government must do more, and whatever possible, to secure our
elections from foreign interference. The integrity of our democracy is
at stake and comments like those from the Secretary today are not
helpful.''

Press Release--Thompson Statement on Mueller Indicating Election
Meddling On-going
June 21, 2018
(WASHINGTON).--Today, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking
Member of the Committee on Homeland Security and co-Chair of the
Congressional Task Force on Election Security, released the following
statement on news from Special Counsel Robert Mueller that election
meddling operations are still on-going:
``As Robert Mueller confirmed today, the threat to our elections from
foreign interference persists and it is high time the White House wakes
up and takes this threat seriously. Inaction will have grave
consequences for public confidence in the integrity of our democracy.
It is unacceptable that the Government official most directly
communicating on the on-going threat to our elections is the Special
Counsel.
``President Trump must start acting like the President of the
country instead of obsessing over photo ops with Kim Jong-un, saving
ZTE jobs in China, and casting aside close allies like Canada to curry
favor with Vladimir Putin. Anything less is an abdication of his oath
of office. With the mid-term elections less than 5 months away, he must
make it clear that election security is the top National security
priority and push Republicans in Congress to do more.''
It has been over 3 months since Congressman Thompson introduced
H.R. 5011, the Election Security Act to help secure our voting systems.
The legislation, with 105 co-sponsors, has still not received a hearing
or a vote.

Congressional Task Force on Election Security Preliminary Findings and
Recommendations
One year ago, 139 million Americans cast their vote in the wake of
a massive Russian cyber-enabled influence operation designed to
``undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate
Secretary [Hillary] Clinton, and harm her electability and potential
presidency.'' Using a vast network of social media trolls, fake ``bot''
accounts, and state-owned news outlets, the Kremlin spread
disinformation to the American electorate through more than 1,000
YouTube videos, 130,000 tweets, and 80,000 Facebook posts viewed by as
many as 150 million people on Facebook platforms alone. They hacked
into U.S. political organizations, selectively exposing sensitive
personal information about DNC staffers using third-party
intermediaries like WikiLeaks. Finally, according to U.S. intelligence
reports, Russia targeted voter registration databases in at least 21
States and sought to infiltrate the networks of voting equipment
vendors, political parties, and at least one local election board.
Although this election cycle was unlike any before, the U.S.
intelligence community warns that it may be the ``New Normal.'' Recent
reports show that the vast majority of U.S. States are still relying on
outdated, insecure voting equipment and other election technologies
that lack even basic cybersecurity standards. Meanwhile, Republicans in
Congress have shown little interest in fighting Russian interference,
and have instead chosen to act on measures that would eliminate rather
than bolster funding for the Election Assistance Commission (EAC), the
Federal agency responsible for helping States secure these vulnerable
systems.
With just over a year until the 2018 midterm elections, it is
important that we reflect on lessons learned in the last year and focus
the spotlight on election security to push for reforms that protect the
integrity of the ballot box.
The Congressional Task Force on Election Security has spent the
past 5 months working together to understand the threats to election
infrastructure and how to address them. The Task Force found:
Election security is National security, and our election
infrastructure is critical infrastructure.--Federal law defines
critical infrastructure as systems and assets for which
``incapacity or destruction . . . would have a debilitating
impact on security, National economic security, National public
health or safety,'' or any combination thereof. Such
infrastructure is given priority access to threat intelligence,
incident response, technical assistance, and other products and
services to help owners and operators harden their defenses. It
is hard to imagine a system failure that would inflict more
damage than a foreign adversary infiltrating our voting systems
to hijack our democratic process. Nonetheless, Trump's Homeland
Security Department (DHS) has wavered on its commitment to
honor the Obama administration's decision to designate election
systems as a critical infrastructure subsector. Whether the
next Secretary of Homeland Security will take a firm stand and
maintain the designation remains to be seen.
Our election infrastructure is vulnerable.--Many elections
across our country are being run on equipment that is either
obsolete or near the end of its useful life. In over 40 States,
elections are carried out using voting machines and voter
registration databases created more than a decade ago. These
technologies are more likely to suffer from known
vulnerabilities that cannot be patched easily, if at all. As we
saw at this year's DEFCON Voting Village, even hackers with
limited prior knowledge, tools, and resources are able to
breach voting machines in a matter of minutes.
These vulnerable systems are being targeted by one of the
world's most sophisticated cyber actors.--According to the U.S.
intelligence community, Russian interference in the 2016
election ``demonstrated a significant escalation in directness,
level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous
operations,'' and warned that ``Moscow will apply lessons
learned from . . . the U.S. Presidential election to future
influence efforts world-wide, including against U.S. allies and
their election processes.'' We cannot reasonably assume that
State voting systems are secure enough to withstand a state-
sponsored cyber attack, and we have no reason to believe these
attacks will subside.
Fortunately, many of the security solutions and best
practices are already known.--We can mitigate many
vulnerabilities with existing, time-tested cybersecurity fixes
found in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and the CIS ``Top
20'' Critical Security Controls. By adopting even the Top 5
security controls, organizations can thwart 85 percent of
common cyber attacks. Security experts also tend to agree on
the types of voting systems most susceptible to compromise, and
are urging election officials to phase out paperless Direct
Recording Electronic (DRE) machines, replace these machines
with voter-marked paper ballots, and carry out risk-limiting
audits to verify election results.
Federal agencies like DHS and EAC are important partners in
this effort, but they need resources and consistent support
from Congress.--We have a rare window of opportunity to promote
the widespread adoption of common-sense security measures that
protect the integrity of the ballot box. This is not the time
to diminish Federal efforts or shut down important lines of
dialog between DHS and election administrators.
DHS is able to provide participating State and local governments
with cyber threat intelligence, vulnerability assessments,
penetration testing, scanning of databases and operating
systems, and other cybersecurity services at no cost. Despite
some initial confusion about the critical infrastructure
designation, DHS has worked to build relationships with
election officials, clarify the voluntary nature of DHS
services, resolve disparities in information sharing and victim
notification, and assist the subsector in formally establishing
a Coordinating Council, which had its first meeting this fall.
Where DHS has rendered assistance, officials report that cyber
hygiene scans and other services are valuable. However, there
is currently a 9-month wait list for Risk and Vulnerability
Assessments, and questions remain about how to ensure threat
information reaches election officials, many of whom lack
security clearances.
The EAC has been a valuable partner to State and county election
officials. The agency has played a crucial role in election
security by serving as a clearinghouse of information for State
and local election officials, facilitating communications
between these officials and DHS, providing easy-to-use
cybersecurity guidance, and testing and certifying voting
machines. Numerous State and local officials have expressed
support and appreciation for the agency's work. Unfortunately,
in recent years Republicans have made several attempts to
terminate the agency. Instead, Congress should support the EAC
and provide it with the resources it needs to help States
secure their election systems. In addition, the President
should nominate and the Senate should confirm a fourth
commissioner to the EAC so that the agency can operate with its
full slate of commissioners.
In light of its preliminary findings, the Task Force makes the
following recommendations:
Maintain the designation of election infrastructure as a
critical infrastructure subsector.--This designation ensures
that State and local election officials receive prioritized
access to DHS's cybersecurity services. Defining election
systems as critical infrastructure means these systems will, on
a more formal and enduring basis, be a priority for DHS
cybersecurity assistance. These services are an important force
multiplier, especially at the State and local level, where
resources are scarce.
Help States fund and maintain secure election systems.--We
cannot ask our State and local election officials to take on a
State actor like Russia alone. Although States and counties are
largely responsible for elections, Congress has a role to play
in helping States fund the purchase of newer, more secure
election systems, and requiring such systems adhere to baseline
cybersecurity standards. Election officials need money to
replace aging voting systems, many of which do not provide an
auditable paper trail. It is important to note, however, that
cyber threats evolve at a rapid pace, and a one-time lump sum
investment is not enough. States also need resources for
maintenance and periodic upgrades, and cybersecurity training
for poll workers and other election officials.
States should conduct post-election risk-limiting audits.--A
risk-limiting audit involves hand counting a certain number of
ballots to determine whether the reported election outcome was
correct. Risk-limiting audits used advanced statistical methods
to enable States to determine that the original vote count was
accurate with a high degree of confidence. These audits are
useful in detecting any incorrect election outcomes, whether
they are caused by a cyber attack or something more mundane
like a programming error. Moreover, conducting these audits as
a matter of course increases public confidence in the election
system.
Empower Federal agencies to be effective partners in pushing
out Nation-wide security reforms.--With mid-term elections in a
year, election officials cannot afford to wait 9 months for
valuable cybersecurity services like Risk and Vulnerability
Assessments. At the same time, we cannot ask DHS to deliver
election assistance at the expense of its other critical
infrastructure customers. We should give DHS the resources it
needs to provide election officials with timely assessments and
other cybersecurity services, without detracting from its
overall critical infrastructure mission. Similarly, Congress
should fund EAC at a level commensurate with its expanded role
in election cybersecurity and confirm a fourth commissioner so
the agency is able to continue to serve as a resource on
election administration.
Establish clear and effective channels for sharing threat
and intelligence information with election officials.--
Effective information sharing is critical to address the
decentralized threat that our Nation faces in terms of securing
our elections. Prior to the 2016 elections, we have seen how
information sharing failures can cause catastrophic events. The
9/11 terrorist attacks exposed serious gaps in information
sharing within the Federal Government and State and local law
enforcement partners. It is imperative that election officials
have access to the most timely and high-level security
information. Chief election officials in each State should have
expedited access to security clearances. DHS needs a formalized
process to provide real-time appropriate threat information to
State and local election officials to improve information flow
and help prevent intrusions in our election infrastructure.
Prioritize cybersecurity training at the State and local
level.--The events of 2016 demonstrate that human error is a
significant vulnerability as it leaves systems open to spear-
phishing and other forms of cyber attack. States and localities
face the daunting task of training hundreds, if not thousands,
of election officials, IT staff, and poll workers on
cybersecurity and risk mitigation. It costs money for States to
produce training materials, and takes staff time to implement
State-wide training programs. The Federal Government should
provide training support either through the EAC or by providing
funding to States to assist with their training programs.

H. Res. 235
The document is retained in the committee files and is available
at: https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-resolution/
235?r=1.
Mr. Thompson. H.R. 5011, the Election Security Act,
currently has over 100 cosponsors, all Democrats. The
legislation would, among other things, provide on-going support
to State and local governments to secure election
infrastructure, instead of addressing election challenges
crisis to crisis; direct the Department of Homeland Security to
address the resources it needs to carry out its election
security responsibilities, and submit a request to Congress,
and establish mechanisms to ensure that State election
officials have timely access to actionable threat information.
I have asked the committee to consider H.R. 5011 and today
renew my request for consideration of this legislation. Even
though Congress appropriated some additional funding for DHS
and the States to improve election security in the fiscal year
2018 omnibus, it was merely a downpayment of what is required.
H.R. 5011 would help provide the States with the appropriate
level of funding.
Today's other witness, Rhode Island's secretary of state,
Nellie Gorbea, participated in one of our task force forums in
October. She provided important insight into the resources the
Federal Government was making available to States, the
resources States need to secure election infrastructure, and
proactive activities she was undertaking at the State level to
improve election security.
I am glad that the secretary is here with us today. Again,
I look forward to her and Under Secretary Kreb's testimony.
Securing our elections is part and parcel to securing our
Democracy.
With that, Mr. Chair, I yield back.
[The statement of Ranking Member Thompson follows:]
Statement of Ranking Member Bennie G. Thompson
July 11, 2018
Under Secretary Krebs, you have taken this job at a critical moment
for our Nation; however, I am concerned you do not have the support you
need from the White House. You are responsible for building private-
sector confidence in DHS's information-sharing programs like Automated
Indicator Sharing, after President Trump toyed with the idea of
planting an absurd story to discredit it for his own political
purposes.
You are responsible for securing Federal networks at a time when
the White House's National Security Advisor has decided to eliminate
the National Security Council's cybersecurity coordinator. You are
responsible for helping secure critical infrastructure networks for a
White House that would rather save jobs in China than heed the advice
of the intelligence community on supply chain vulnerabilities. And you
are responsible for helping State and local governments secure election
infrastructure following Russia's brazen election meddling efforts in
2016, which the President has been reluctant to call out and which
Congressional Republicans, until recently, were content to ignore.
As we sit here today, President Trump is in Europe complicating
your mission. Instead of working with our European allies to confront
Russia--a shared adversary whose attempts to undermine Western
democratic institutions are growing more and more bold--he is trolling
them to curry favor with Russian President Vladimir Putin. President
Trump has said he will address Russia's 2016 election meddling in a
meeting with Putin, but he has never demonstrated a credible ability to
confront Putin with our intelligence community's findings. He has
predicted his meeting with Putin ``may be the easiest,'' so I have no
reason to believe anything productive will come of it. This President's
failure to take seriously the threat to our democracy is one of the
main reasons that we must do effective and thorough oversight in this
body.
Although I am pleased that the Majority has finally scheduled
today's hearing, I am disappointed that the Majority failed to invite a
full range of stakeholders, including the Election Assistance
Commission, or hold the hearing at a time when DHS's Federal partners
were available to participate. It is important to note for the record
that committee Democrats have been requesting official oversight
activities on election security since before the 2016 election.
And in March 2017, after months of inaction by the Republican
majority, I introduced a Resolution of Inquiry seeking information from
the Department on its activities related to countering Russian election
interference in the 2016 Presidential election so we would understand
how to protect our elections in the future. It was unceremoniously
rejected along party lines.
Committee Democrats have written to the Chairman no less than five
times since August 2016 to request a hearing, briefing, or
investigation on vulnerabilities to our election infrastructure. We
have also reiterated these requests on numerous occasions on the
record. Despite these repeated requests, this committee did not conduct
a formal hearing or briefing on the topic until April 2018--15 months
after the intelligence community released its report concluding that
the Russian government had attempted to interfere in the 2016 elections
and would attempt to do so again.
When the Trump administration's six top intelligence officials
testified before the Senate that Russia was targeting our 2018
elections, this committee--the committee that prides itself on acting
in the wake of current issues--followed suit of the House Republican
Conference by shirking its responsibility to act on this urgent threat.
Ranking Members of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee,
the Foreign Affairs Committee, Judiciary Committee, the Permanent
Select Committee on Intelligence, the House Armed Services, and the
House Administration Committee have all urged their Chairs or Speaker
Ryan to aggressively address this on-going National security threat.
Our calls for action were ignored, responded to with a half-hearted
acknowledgement of the threat and a vague promise for future action, or
the offer to ask a Government witness about election security at a
hearing on another topic.
Because our requests for thorough hearings and briefings were
denied, some committee Democrats joined with Democrats on the Committee
on House Administration to form the Congressional Task Force on
Election Security. I openly asked Republicans to join us and submit
their ideas, yet no Republican Member provided their input or attended
the task force's public events.
After studying the topic for 8 months, meeting with stakeholders,
and holding a series of forums and briefings, the Task Force produced a
report and introduced legislation to implement the recommendations.
H.R. 5011, the Election Security Act, currently has over 100 co-
sponsors--all Democrats. The legislation would, among other things:
provide on-going support to State and local governments to
secure election infrastructure, instead of addressing election
challenges crisis-to-crisis;
direct the Department of Homeland Security to assess the
resources it needs to carry out its election security
responsibilities and submit a request to Congress; and
establish mechanisms to ensure that State election officials
have timely access to actionable threat information.
I have asked this committee to consider H.R. 5011, and today renew
my request for consideration of this legislation. Even though Congress
appropriated some additional funding for DHS and the States to improve
election security in the fiscal year 2018 omnibus, it was merely a
down-payment on what is required. H.R. 5011 would help provide the
States with the appropriate level of funding.
Today's other witness, Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie
Gorbea, participated in one of our Task Force forums in October. She
provided important insight into the resources the Federal Government
was making available to States, the resources States need to secure
election infrastructure, and proactive activities she was undertaking
at the State level to improve election security. I am glad that
Secretary Gorbea is here with us again today, and I look forward to her
and Under Secretary Krebs' testimony. Securing our elections is part
and parcel to securing our democracy.
Chairman McCaul. The Ranking Member yields back.
Other Members of the committee are reminded that opening
statements may be submitted for the record.
[The statement of Hon. Jackson Lee follows:]
Statement of Hon. Sheila Jackson Lee
July 11, 2018
Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson thank you for holding
today's hearing so that the committee may learn more about ``DHS
Progress in Security Election Systems and Other Critical
Infrastructure.''
I thank today's witnesses:
The Honorable Christopher Krebs, Under Secretary, National
Protection and Programs Directorate with the Department of
Homeland Security; and
The Honorable Nellie Gorbea, Secretary of State, State of
Rhode Island.
I thank each of you for bringing your expert view of the cyber
threats against our Nation's system of elections and other matters
regarding the security of critical infrastructure.
The House Committee on Homeland Security has the responsibility of
providing for the cybersecurity of Federal civilian agencies as well as
the to secure the Nation's 16 critical infrastructure sectors from
cyber and other threats.
On January 6, 2017, Homeland Security Secretary Johnson designated
election systems as critical infrastructure, and created a new
subsector under the existing Government Facilities Sector designation.
The Election Infrastructure Subsector covers a wide range of
physical and electronic assets such as storage facilities, polling
places, and centralized vote tabulation locations used to support the
election process, and information and communications technology to
include voter registration databases, voting machines, and other
systems to manage the election process and report and display results
on behalf of State and local governments.
The process established for contacting and working with local and
State elections administrators seems to be working well.
The work to secure our Nation's election system from cyber threats
is on-going, which is why this hearing is relevant.
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) mission in
cybersecurity and infrastructure protection is focused on enhancing
greater collaboration on cybersecurity across the 16 critical
infrastructure sectors and the sharing of cyber threat information
between the private sector and Federal, State, and local partners.
I thank Ranking Member Thompson for his leadership in co-chairing
the Congressional Task Force on Election Security, which issued a
report earlier this year which outlined areas of concern regarding the
security of election systems.
Leader Pelosi convened the Task Force after waiting a year for the
leadership of the House to investigate Russian interference in the 2016
U.S. Elections.
We know the threats that computing devices and systems face, which
are almost too numerous to count:
Bot-nets;
Ransom-ware;
Zero Day Events;
Mal-ware;
Denial of Service Attacks;
Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks;
Pharming;
Phishing;
Data Theft;
Data Breaches;
SQL Injection;
Man-in-the-middle attack.
The list goes on, but suffice it to say that as hard as one person
in our Government is working to stop cyber attacks there are likely
another thousand attempting to breach a system or device owned by a
United States citizen.
This is why I introduced H.R. 3202, the Cyber Vulnerability
Disclosure Reporting Act, which passed the House earlier this year.
The bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a
report on the policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber
vulnerability disclosures.
The report will include an annex with information on instances in
which cybersecurity vulnerability disclosure policies and procedures
were used to disclose details on identified weaknesses in computing
systems that or digital devices at risk.
The report will provide information on the degree to which the
information provided by DHS was used by industry and other
stakeholders.
The report may also contain a description of how the Secretary of
Homeland Security is working with other Federal entities and critical
infrastructure owners and operators to prevent, detect, and mitigate
cyber vulnerabilities.
The reason that I worked to bring this bill before the full House
for consideration is the problem often referred to as a ``Zero Day
Event.''
A Zero Day Event describes the situation that network security
professionals may find themselves when a previously unknown error or
flaw in computing code is exploited by a cybercriminal or terrorist.
The term ``Zero Day Event'' simply means that there is zero time to
prepare a defense against a cyber attack.
When a defect in software is discovered then network engineers and
software companies can work to develop a ``patch'' to fix the problem
before it can be exploited by those who may seek to do harm.
H.R. 3202 seeks a report on the on-going Department of Homeland
Security's policies and procedures for coordinating cyber vulnerability
disclosures such as Zero Day Events with private-sector partners.
Because vulnerabilities can be used by adversaries it is important
that this sensitive information be managed securely so details are not
routinely made available neither to the public nor to Congress.
H.R. 3202 provides the Congress with the opportunity to understand
the process and procedures used by the Department of Homeland Security
and the benefit these disclosures may have for private-sector entities
participating in programs in support of cybersecurity.
During the 2016 election we learned of new threats from cyber space
that go far beyond any that would have been considered in previous
elections.
Russia targeted our Presidential Election according to the report,
``Background to Assessing Russian Activities and Intentions in Recent
U.S. Elections: The Analytic Process and Cyber Incident Attribution,''
provided by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's
National Intelligence Council.
Russia used every cyber espionage tool available to influence the
outcome of the Presidential election by using a multi-faceted campaign
that included theft of data; strategically timed release of stolen
information; production of fake news; and manipulation of facts to
avoid blame.
The Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate (GRU) is
suspected by our intelligence agencies of having begun cyber operations
targeting the United States election as early as March 2016.
They took on the persona of ``Guccifer 2.0,'' ``DCLeaks.com,'' and
Wikileaks as the identities that would be reported as having
involvement in the work they had undertaken to undermine our Nation's
Presidential election.
Russia is blamed for breaching 21 local and State election systems,
which they studied extensively.
In February 2018, special counsel Robert Mueller released
indictments of 13 Russians, at least one of whom has direct ties to
Russian President Vladimir Putin.
The 37-page indictment details the actions taken to interfere with
the U.S. political system, including the 2016 U.S. Presidential
election.
Among the charges, which include charges for obstruction of
justice, are several especially notable details.
The indictment states that 13 defendants posed as U.S. persons and
created false U.S. personas and operated social media pages and groups
designed to attract U.S. audiences.
The social media profiles ``addressed divisive U.S. political and
social issues'' and falsely claimed to be controlled by U.S. activists.
The defendants are also accused of using ``the stolen identities of
real U.S. persons to post on social media accounts'' which, over time,
became the chosen ``means to reach significant numbers of Americans for
purposes of interfering with the U.S. political system, including the
Presidential election of 2016.''
The goal of the effort was to sow discord in the U.S. political
system, including the 2016 U.S. Presidential election.
The internet does not sleep--and nor do our Nation's on-line
adversaries.
That Russia used cyber intrusions to attack United States political
institutions to collect data to manipulate the media and the public
with the purpose of influencing the outcome of the 2016 Presidential
elections is now an undisputed fact.
The United States has enemies in other corners of the globe who
would not hesitate to attack our election system if given the chance.
These foreign adversaries do not share our commitment to democracy,
liberty, and human rights, or the precious freedoms we hold dear.
This Congress must do its job and delve into the issue of Russian
involvement in our National election.
The work today must focus on election recovery should a serious
cyber incident occur during an election.
Vulnerabilities of computing systems are not limited to intentional
attacks, but can include acts of nature, human error, or technology
failing to perform as intended.
I am particularly concerned that so many jurisdictions rely on
electronic poll books, to check in voters before issuing them ballots,
with no paper backups; and the use of paperless electronic voting
machines without sufficient paper ballot options in polling locations
should they be needed.
The right and better approach to election cybersecurity is to be
prepared and not need options for voters to cast ballots, should voting
systems fail, rather than being unprepared and needing options for
voters to cast ballots during an election.
We must be steadfast in our resolve to have a strong shield to
defend civilian and critical infrastructure networks for all threats
foreign and domestic.
I look forward to the testimony of today's witnesses.
Thank you.
Chairman McCaul. Just for the record, we had the Secretary
testify before this committee, it was openly available on this
topic. We had a Classified briefing for all House members on
election security.
We have been waiting for Under Secretary Krebs to get
confirmed by the Senate, and, sir, we just congratulate on your
confirmation by the U.S. Senate. We are fortunate, now, to have
you here today to talk about this issue. I also think that the
administration is going to be well-served by you, sir, and they
are lucky to have you.
On June 15, 2018, Chris Krebs was sworn in as the under
secretary for the Department of Homeland Security's National
Protection and Programs Directorate after being confirmed by
the Senate by a voice vote. As under secretary, Mr. Krebs
oversees NPPD's efforts to defend civilian networks, secure
Federal facilities, manage systemic risk to National critical
functions, and work with stakeholders to raise the security
baseline of the Nation's cyber and physical infrastructure.
This is his second tour working at DHS, previously serving
as a senior advisor to the assistant secretary for
infrastructure protection and playing a formative role in a
number of National and international risk management programs.
I appreciate your leadership in both the private and the public
sectors, sir. Thank you for being here.
I now would like to yield to Mr. Langevin from Rhode Island
to introduce the Rhode Island secretary of state.
Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you
and Ranking Member Thompson for reaching out to me to
facilitate inviting Rhode Island Secretary of State Nellie
Gorbea here to the committee for--to hear her testimony and the
progress she has made in securing election--Rhode Island's
election systems.
Before I introduce Secretary Gorbea, I just want to take a
moment to publicly congratulate Secretary Krebs on his finally
being confirmed, officially. We had a brief conversation and
wanted to publicly, again, congratulate you, Secretary. I
appreciate the on-going relationship and work that you and I
have done together, and discussions we have had on election and
cybersecurity, in particular election security. I hope that
dialog can continue in our working together.
But Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Thompson, very proud,
today, to be honored--to be able to recognize and welcome
Nellie Gorbea, Rhode Island's secretary of state, to the panel,
today.
Secretary Gorbea has helped position the Ocean State as a
leader in election security. Under her direction, Rhode Island
replaced all of its two-decades-old voting equipment prior to
the 2016 election with new paper ballot systems. Following the
2016 elections, Secretary Gorbea has taken all the steps that
we need--that we would hope for States to take to better secure
their elections systems.
She has emphasized proper I.T. staffing and training,
solicited help from the Election Assistance Commission and from
DHS and proactively exchanged information with peers through
the Multi-State ISAC, Elections Infrastructure ISAC, and the
National Association of Secretaries of State.
Now, with the help of Federal grants appropriated by this
Congress, Secretary Gorbea is directing the overhaul of Rhode
Island's voter registration database, initiating local level
grants to increase security and implementing the country's
second mandatory post-election risk limiting audit process.
Just as importantly, Secretary Gorbea has implemented reforms
to increase voter access to the polls in Rhode Island,
including on-line and automated voter registration.
Secretary Gorbea, thank you for making the trip down from
Rhode Island to here, today, with us. Thank you for your on-
going efforts to expand Rhode Island's access to the polls, and
to prevent foreign adversaries' access to the same.
Mr. Chairman, this is a position that I once held as Rhode
Island secretary of state. I am very proud and grateful for the
leadership that Secretary Gorbea has continued to provide and
has, certainly, exceeded even things that I have accomplished
when I was there, and I am very proud of what she has done. I
hope you and all of our colleagues take the opportunity to ask
the secretary about her successes and how Rhode Island's
leadership can be a model for other States to follow.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. With that, I yield back.
Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields back. Thank you,
both, for being here today. Your full written statements will
appear in the record.
The Chair now recognizes Under Secretary Krebs for an
opening statement.
STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER C. KREBS, UNDER SECRETARY, NATIONAL
PROTECTION AND PROGRAMS DIRECTORATE, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF
HOMELAND SECURITY
Under Secretary Krebs. Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member
Thompson, and Members of the committee, thank you for today's
opportunity to testify regarding the Department of Homeland
Security's on-going efforts to assist State and local election
officials, those who own and operate election systems, with
improving the resilience of election security across America.
Today's hearing is timely as primary elections are,
generally, complete. Election officials now have some time to
reflect and get ready for the November mid-term elections. In
fact, later this week, our leadership team at DHS will meet
with election officials as they gather in Philadelphia for
their National summer conference.
It is not lost on me that we will discuss defending our
democratic institutions and the very cradle of democracy, the
city that birthed this great Nation. The 2018 mid-terms remain
a potential target for Russian actors, but the intelligence
community has yet to see any evidence of a robust campaign
aimed at tampering with our election infrastructure along the
lines of 2016 or influencing the makeup of the House or Senate
races.
The intelligence community, however, continues to see
Russia using social media flag--false flag personas,
sympathetic spokesmen, and other means to influence or inflame
positions on opposite ends of controversial issues. These
efforts appear to be more focused on dividing rather than
targeting specific politicians or political candidates.
Nonetheless, we remain vigilant and any attempt to undermine
our democracy will be met with consequences. In the mean time,
we will continue to work with our election partners to
strengthen the resilience of our election systems.
As I have traveled across the country during primary
season, it is clear to me that secretaries of state and other
election officials are not sitting back; they take
cybersecurity and security in general seriously. Our mission at
DHS is to help our stakeholders better understand and manage
the risks they face.
Through concerted efforts, in part by building
relationships, establishing trust, and understanding what it is
that our stakeholders need to manage their risks, we have made
significant progress over the last year-and-a-half. Working
with State and local election officials, as well as with
private-sector partners who support them, we have created
Government and private-sector councils who, collaboratively,
work to share information, promote best practices, and develop
strategies to reduce risk to the Nation's election systems.
We have also created the Election Infrastructure
Information Sharing and Analysis Center, or ISAC, made up of
over 1,000 members in just under 5 months, including all 50
States. We are also sponsoring security clearances for multiple
election officials in each State. We have increased the
availability and deployment of free technical services.
We have also offered cybersecurity and physical security
training and exercises and later this summer, we will have a 3-
day tabletop exercise with all States involved. Our suite of
services will continue to mature as the requirements identified
by our election stakeholders mature.
We understand that the only way to deliver a resilient
election system is to work, collaboratively, with those
election--with those officials on the front lines running the
process. Our work to secure election officials--I am sorry--to
secure election infrastructure is part of my directorate's
broader mission to secure all of our Nation's critical
infrastructure.
We are responsible for coordinating the overall Federal
effort to promote the security and resilience of the Nation's
critical infrastructure. As we confront--confront threats posed
by a range of capable adversaries, DHS remains focused on
ensuring National unity of effort. It is critical that we
combine the unique expertise of the intelligence community, law
enforcement, sector-specific agencies, and others, to provide
an integrated approach to risk management across our Nation's
critical infrastructure.
Rarely is a cyber event sector-specific. Our adversaries
target systems that are cross-sector and the growing
interdependencies across sectors demand this integrated
approach. Accordingly, DHS serves as information and operations
integrator focused on delivering cross-sector public-private
risk management strategies to enhance the resilience of our
Nation's infrastructure.
Before I conclude, I would like to take a moment to thank
Congress and this committee in particular for legislative
progress thus far in strengthening DHS's cybersecurity and
critical infrastructure authorities. Specifically, we strongly
support final passage of legislation to create the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, SISA, at DHS
which would rename and reorganize the National Protection and
Programs Directorate. This change reflects the important work
we carry out every day to safeguard and secure our critical
infrastructure.
Thank you and I look forward to your questions.
[The prepared statement of Secretary Krebs follows:]
Prepared Statement of Christopher C. Krebs
July 11, 2018
Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and Members of the
committee, thank you for today's opportunity to testify regarding the
U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) on-going efforts to assist
with reducing and mitigating risks to our election infrastructure. DHS
is eager to share with you the progress we have made to establish
trust-based partnerships with our Nation's election officials who
administer our democratic election processes.
Safeguarding and securing cyber space is a core homeland security
mission. DHS is responsible for protecting civilian Federal Government
networks and collaborating with other Federal agencies, as well as
State, local, Tribal, and territorial governments, and the private
sector to defend against cyber threats. We endeavor to enhance cyber
threat information sharing across the globe to stop cyber incidents
before they start and help businesses and Government agencies to
protect their cyber systems and quickly recover should such an attack
occur. By bringing together all levels of government, the private
sector, international partners, and the public, we are taking action to
protect against cybersecurity risks, improve our whole-of-Government
incident response capabilities, enhance information sharing of best
practices and cyber threats, and to strengthen resilience.
Recognizing that the 2018 U.S. mid-term elections are a potential
target for malicious cyber activity, DHS is committed to robust
engagement with State and local election officials, as well as private-
sector entities, to assist them with defining their risk, and providing
them with information and capabilities that enable them to better
defend their infrastructure.
Given the foundational role that elections play in a free and
democratic society, in January 2017 the Secretary of Homeland Security
designated election infrastructure as a critical infrastructure
subsector. Under our system of laws, Federal elections are administered
by State and local election officials in thousands of jurisdictions
across the country. These officials manage election infrastructure and
ensure its security and resilience on a day-to-day basis.
As such, DHS and our Federal partners have formalized the
prioritization of voluntary cybersecurity assistance for election
infrastructure similar to that which is provided to a range of other
critical infrastructure entities, such as financial institutions and
electric utilities.
Since 2016, DHS's National Protection and Programs Directorate
(NPPD) has convened Federal Government and election officials regularly
to share cybersecurity risk information and to determine an effective
means of assistance. The Election Infrastructure Subsector (EIS)
Government Coordinating Council (GCC) has worked to establish goals and
objectives, including plans for EIS engagement and the establishment of
a sector-specific plan (SSP). GCC representatives include DHS, the
Election Assistance Commission (EAC), and 24 State and local election
officials. Participation in the council is entirely voluntary and does
not change the fundamental role of State and local jurisdictions in
overseeing elections.
The Department and the EAC worked with election industry
representatives to launch an industry-led Sector Coordinating Council
(SCC), a self-organized, self-run, and self-governed council with
leadership designated by the sector membership. The SCC serves as
industry's principal entity for coordinating with the Government on
critical infrastructure security activities and issues related to
sector-specific strategies and policies. This collaboration is
conducted under DHS's authority to provide a forum in which Government
and private-sector entities can jointly engage in a broad spectrum of
activities to coordinate critical infrastructure security and
resilience efforts which is used in each of the critical infrastructure
sectors established under Presidential Policy Directive 21, Critical
Infrastructure Security and Resilience. The process is a well-tested
mechanism across critical infrastructure sectors for sharing threat
information among the Federal Government and critical infrastructure
partners, advancing risk management efforts, and prioritizing services
available to sector partners in a trusted environment.
NPPD also engages directly with election officials--coordinating
requests for assistance, risk mitigation, information sharing, and
incident coordination, resources, and services. In order to ensure a
coordinated approach from the Federal Government, NPPD has convened
stakeholders from across the Federal Government through an Election
Task Force. The task force serves to provide actionable information and
offer assistance to assist election officials with strengthening their
election infrastructure by reducing and mitigating cyber risk, and
increasing resilience of their processes.
Within the context of today's hearing, I will address the
unclassified assessment of malicious cyber operations directed against
U.S. election infrastructure and our efforts to help enhance the
security of elections that are administered by jurisdictions around the
country.
enhancing security for future elections
DHS regularly coordinates with the intelligence community and law
enforcement partners on potential threats to the homeland. Among non-
Federal partners, DHS has been engaging State and local officials, as
well as relevant private-sector entities, to assess the scale and scope
of malicious cyber activity potentially targeting the U.S. election
infrastructure. Election infrastructure includes the information and
communications technology, capabilities, physical assets, and
technologies that enable the registration and validation of voters; the
casting, transmission, tabulation, and reporting of votes; and the
certification, auditing, and verification of elections.
DHS is committed to ensuring a coordinated response from DHS and
its Federal partners to plan for, prepare for, and mitigate risk to
election infrastructure. We understand that working with election
infrastructure stakeholders is essential to ensuring a more secure
election. DHS and our stakeholders are increasing awareness of
potential vulnerabilities and providing capabilities to enhance the
security of U.S. election infrastructure as well as that of our
democratic allies.
Election officials across the country have a long-standing history
of working both individually and collectively to reduce risks and
ensure the integrity of their elections. In partnering with these
officials through both new and on-going engagements, DHS is working to
provide value-added--yet voluntary--services to support their efforts
to secure elections.
Improving Coordination with State, local, Tribal, Territorial
(SLTT) and private-sector partners.--Increasingly, the Nation's
election infrastructure leverages information technology (IT) for
efficiency and convenience, but also exposes systems to cybersecurity
risks, just like in any other enterprise environment. Just like with
other sectors, NPPD helps stakeholders in Federal departments and
agencies, SLTT governments, and the private sector to manage these
cybersecurity risks. Consistent with our long-standing partnerships
with State and local governments, we have been working with election
officials to share information about cybersecurity risks, and to
provide voluntary resources and technical assistance.
The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center
(NCCIC) works with the MS-ISAC to provide threat and vulnerability
information to State and local officials. For nearly a decade, DHS has
funded the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-
ISAC), which has since created the EI-ISAC, to enable its members to
share cybersecurity information and collaborate with each other. The
EI-ISAC's membership includes almost 1,000 SLTT election-specific
entities. Through the MS-ISAC, it has representatives co-located with
the NCCIC to enable regular collaboration and access to information and
services for State chief information officers.
Providing Technical Assistance and Sharing Information. NPPD
actively promotes a range of services including:
Cyber hygiene service for internet-facing systems.--Through this
automated, remote scan, NPPD may provide a report identifying
vulnerabilities and mitigation recommendations to improve the
cybersecurity of systems connected to the internet, such as on-line
voter registration systems, election night reporting systems, and other
internet-connected election management systems.
Risk and vulnerability assessments.--We have prioritized State and
local election systems upon request, and increased the availability of
risk and vulnerability assessments (RVAs). These in-depth, on-site
evaluations include a system-wide understanding of vulnerabilities,
focused on both internal and external systems. We provide a full report
of vulnerabilities and recommended mitigations following the testing.
Incident response assistance.--We encourage election officials to
report suspected malicious cyber activity to the NCCIC. Upon request,
the NCCIC can provide assistance in identifying and remediating a cyber
incident. Information reported to the NCCIC is also critical to the
Federal Government's ability to broadly assess malicious attempts to
infiltrate election systems. This technical information will also be
shared with other State officials so they have the ability to defend
their own systems from similar malicious activity.
Knowing what to do when a security incident happens--whether
physical or cyber--before it happens, is critical. NPPD supports
election officials with incident response planning including
participating in exercises and reviewing incident response playbooks.
Crisis communications are a core component of these efforts, ensuring
officials are able to communicate transparently and authoritatively to
their constituents when an incident unfolds. In some cases, we do this
directly with State and local jurisdictions. In others, we partner with
outside organizations. We recognize that securing our Nation's systems
is a shared responsibility, and we are leveraging partnerships to
advance that mission.
Information sharing.--NPPD maintains numerous platforms and
services to share relevant information on cyber incidents. State
election officials may also receive information directly from the
NCCIC. The NCCIC also works with the EI-ISAC, which allows election
officials to connect with the EI-ISAC or their State chief information
officer to rapidly receive information they can use to protect their
systems. Best practices, cyber threat information, and technical
indicators, some of which had been previously Classified, have been
shared with election officials in thousands of State and local
jurisdictions. In all cases, the information sharing and/or use of such
cybersecurity risk indicators, or information related to cybersecurity
risks and incidents complies with applicable lawful restrictions on its
collection and use and with DHS policies protective of privacy and
civil liberties.
Classified information sharing.--To most effectively share
information with all of our partners--not just those with security
clearances--we work with the intelligence community to rapidly
declassify relevant intelligence or provide tearlines. While DHS
prioritizes declassifying information to the extent possible, we also
provide Classified information to cleared stakeholders, as appropriate.
DHS has been working with State chief election officials and additional
election staff in each State to provide them with security clearances.
By working with ODNI and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), in
February 2018 election officials from each State received 1-day read-
ins for a Classified threat briefing while they were in Washington, DC.
This briefing demonstrated our commitment to ensuring election
officials have the information they need to understand the threats they
face.
Field-based cybersecurity advisors and protective security
advisors.--NPPD has more than 130 cybersecurity and protective security
personnel available to provide actionable information and connect
election officials to a range of tools and resources to improve the
cybersecurity preparedness of election systems; and to secure the
physical site security of voting machine storage and polling places.
These advisors are also available to assist with planning and incident
management for both cyber and physical incidents.
Physical and protective security tools, training, and resources.--
NPPD provides guidance and tools to improve the security of polling
sites and other physical election infrastructure. This guidance can be
found at www.dhs.gov/hometown-security. This guidance helps to train
administrative and volunteer staff on identifying and reporting
suspicious activities, active-shooter scenarios, and what to do if they
suspect an improvised explosive device.
election security efforts moving forward
DHS has made tremendous strides and is committed to working
collaboratively with those on the front lines of administering our
elections to secure election infrastructure from risks. The
establishment of Government and sector-coordinating councils will build
the foundations for this enduring partnership not only in 2018, but for
future elections as well. We will remain transparent as well as agile
in combating and securing our physical and cyber infrastructure.
However, we recognize that there are significant technology needs
across SLTT governments, and State and local election systems, in
particular. It will take significant and continual investment to ensure
that election systems across the Nation are upgraded and secure, with
vulnerable systems retired. These efforts require a whole-of-Government
approach. The President and this administration are committed to
addressing these risks.
There is a fundamental link between public trust in our election
infrastructure and the confidence the American public places in basic
democratic functions. Ensuring the security of our electoral process is
a vital National interest and one of our highest priorities. Our voting
infrastructure is diverse, subject to local control, and has many
checks and balances. As the threat environment evolves, we will
continue to work with Federal agencies, State and local partners, and
private-sector entities to enhance our understanding of the threat; and
to make essential physical and cybersecurity tools and resources
available to the public and private sectors to increase security and
resiliency.
national risk management
In addition to addressing election security, we coordinate the
overall Federal effort to promote the security and resilience of the
Nation's critical infrastructure, and is responsible for administering
the implementation of Federal Government cybersecurity policies and
practices. Cyber threats remain one of the most significant strategic
risks for the United States, threatening our National security,
economic prosperity, and public health and safety. We have long been
confronted with myriad attacks against our digital networks. Americans
have seen advanced persistent threat actors, including hackers, cyber
criminals, and nation-states, increase the frequency and sophistication
of these attacks. Our adversaries have been developing and using
advanced cyber capabilities to undermine critical infrastructure,
target our livelihoods and innovation, steal our National security
secrets, and threaten our democracy.
Global cyber incidents, such as the ``WannaCry'' ransomware
incident and the ``NotPetya'' malware incident in May and June 2017,
respectively, are examples of malicious actors leveraging cyber space
to create disruptive effects and cause economic loss. These incidents
exploited known vulnerabilities in software commonly used across the
globe. Prior to these events, NPPD had already taken actions to help
protect networks from similar types of attacks. Through requested
vulnerability scanning, we helped stakeholders identify vulnerabilities
on their networks so they could be patched before incidents and attacks
occur. Recognizing that not all users are able to install patches
immediately, we shared additional mitigation guidance to assist network
defenders. As the incidents unfolded, we led the Federal Government's
incident response efforts, working with our interagency partners,
including providing situational awareness, information sharing, malware
analysis, and technical assistance to affected entities.
In a series of incidents since at least May of last year, working
with U.S. and international partners, DHS and FBI have identified
Russian government actors targeting Government entities and businesses
in the energy, nuclear, water, aviation, and critical manufacturing
sectors. DHS assesses that this campaign ultimately collected
information pertaining to industrial control systems with the intent to
gain access to industrial control systems environments. The intrusions
have been comprised of two distinct categories of victims: Staging and
intended targets. In other words, through the Department's incident
response actions, we have observed this advanced persistent threat
actor target certain entities that then become pivot points, leveraging
existing relationships between the initial victim and the intended
targets to hide their activity, as part of a multi-stage intrusion
campaign to gain access to networks of major, high-value assets that
operate components of our Nation's critical infrastructure. Based on
our analysis and observed indicators of compromise, DHS has confidence
that this campaign is still on-going, and threat actors are actively
pursuing their ultimate long-term campaign objectives. DHS and the FBI
have published a joint technical alert to enable network defenders to
identify and take action to reduce exposure to this malicious activity.
cybersecurity priorities
This administration has prioritized protecting and defending our
public and economic safety from the range of threats that exist today,
including those emanating from cyber space. Last year, the President
signed Executive Order 13800, Strengthening the Cybersecurity of
Federal Networks and Critical Infrastructure. This Executive Order set
in motion a series of assessments and deliverables to understand how to
improve our defenses and lower our risk to cyber threats. This order
also emphasized the importance of accountability--clarifying that
Department and agency heads are responsible and will be held
accountable for the security of their networks and systems. NPPD plays
an important role in providing capabilities, services, and direction to
Federal agencies.
Across the Federal Government, agencies have been implementing
action plans to use the industry-standard National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework. Agencies are
reporting to DHS and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on their
cybersecurity risk mitigation and acceptance choices. In coordination
with OMB, DHS is evaluating the totality of these Agency reports in
order to comprehensively assess the adequacy of the Federal
Government's overall cybersecurity risk management posture.
Although Federal agencies have primary responsibility for their own
cybersecurity, DHS provides a common set of security tools that helps
agencies manage their cyber risk. NPPD's assistance to Federal agencies
includes: (1) Providing tools to safeguard civilian Executive branch
networks through the National Cybersecurity Protection System (NCPS),
which includes ``EINSTEIN'' and Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation
(CDM) programs, (2) measuring and motivating agencies to implement
policies, directives, standards, and guidelines, (3) serving as a hub
for information sharing and incident reporting, and (4) providing
operational and technical assistance, including threat information
dissemination and risk and vulnerability assessments, as well as
incident response services. The NCCIC is the civilian government's hub
for cybersecurity information sharing, asset incident response, and
coordination for both critical infrastructure and the Federal
Government.
DHS conducts a number of activities to measure agencies'
cybersecurity practices and works with agencies to improve risk
management practices. The Federal Information Security Modernization
Act of 2014 (FISMA) provided the Secretary of Homeland Security with
the authority to develop and oversee implementation of Binding
Operational Directives (BOD) to agencies. In May 2018, the Secretary
issued a BOD to update a previous BOD related to securing High-Value
Assets--those assets, Federal information systems, information, and
data for which unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption,
modification, or destruction could cause a significant impact to U.S.
National security interests, foreign relations, the economy, or to the
public confidence, civil liberties, or public health and safety of the
American people.
NPPD works with interagency partners to prioritize High-Value
Assets for assessment and remediation activities across the Federal
Government. For instance, we conduct security architecture reviews on
these High-Value Assets to help agencies assess their network
architecture and configurations. The updated BOD enhances NPPD's
approach to conducting these engagements to provide agencies with
improved results and finding by expanding system scope, refining
assessment methodologies, and using less-constratined penetration
testing approaches to resemble tactics, techniques, and procedures used
by advanced threat actors attempting to gain unauthorized access.
As part of the effort to secure High-Value Assets, DHS conducts in-
depth vulnerability assessments of prioritized agency these assets to
determine how an adversary could penetrate a system, move around an
agency's network to access sensitive data, and exfiltrate such data
without being detected. These assessments include services such as
penetration testing, wireless security analysis, and ``phishing''
evaluations in which DHS hackers send emails to agency personnel and
test whether recipients click on potentially malicious links. DHS has
focused these assessments on Federal systems that may be of particular
interest to adversaries or support uniquely significant data or
services. These assessments provide system owners with recommendations
to address identified vulnerabilities. DHS provides these same
assessments, on a voluntary basis upon request, to private-sector and
State, local, territorial, and Tribal partners. DHS also works with the
General Services Administration to ensure that contractors can provide
assessments that align with our HVA initiative to agencies.
In addition to efforts to protect Government networks, Executive
Order 13800 requires continued examination of how the Federal
Government and industry work together to protect our Nation's critical
infrastructure, prioritizing deeper, more collaborative public-private
partnerships in threat assessment, detection, protection, and
mitigation. In collaboration with civilian, defense, and intelligence
agencies, we have worked to identify authorities and capabilities that
agencies could employ, soliciting input from the private sector, and
developed recommendations to support the cybersecurity efforts of those
critical infrastructure entities at greatest risk of attacks that could
result in catastrophic impacts.
As part of this effort, DHS is establishing a program office to
strengthen support to such entities and improve coordination of
interagency support. Through the program office, we will coordinate
with Federal and non-Federal partners to enhance access to Classified
information, improve incident communication and coordination, and
improve cross-sector information sharing, among other efforts.
conclusion
In the face of increasingly sophisticated threats, DHS employees
stand on the front lines of the Federal Government's efforts to defend
our Nation's critical infrastructure from natural disasters, terrorism
and adversarial threats, and technological risk such as those caused by
cyber threats. Our infrastructure environment today is complex and
dynamic with interdependencies that add to the challenge of securing
and making it more resilient. Technological advances have introduced
the ``Internet of Things'' and cloud computing, offering increased
access and streamlined efficiencies, while increasing our footprint of
access points that could be leveraged by adversaries to gain
unauthorized access to networks. As our Nation continues to evolve and
new threats emerge, we must integrate cyber and physical risk in order
to understand how to effectively secure it. Expertise around cyber-
physical risk and cross-sector critical infrastructure
interdependencies is where NPPD brings unique expertise and
capabilities.
We must ensure that NPPD is appropriately organized to address
cybersecurity threats both now and in the future, and we appreciate
this committee's leadership in working to establish the Cybersecurity
and Infrastructure Security Agency. As the committee considers these
issues, we are committed to working with Congress to ensure that this
effort is done in a way that cultivates a safer, more secure, and
resilient homeland.
Thank you for the opportunity to appear before the committee today,
and I look forward to your questions.
Chairman McCaul. Thank you under secretary and I look
forward to working with you to make sure the Senate passes
SISA. I think it is important not only to protecting all 16
critical infrastructures but also our election system.
Chair now recognizes the Secretary of State Gorbea for an
opening statement. Do you have a microphone?
STATEMENT OF NELLIE M. GORBEA, SECRETARY OF STATE, STATE OF
RHODE ISLAND
Ms. Gorbea. Good morning and thank you, Chairman McCaul,
Ranking Member Thompson, and Members of the committee for the
invitation to participate in this important discussion. I
commend your committee for holding this hearing to learn more
about what is being done at the Federal, State, and local
levels to protect our Nation's election systems and what can be
done to improve upon this work.
Advances in technology have brought with them a paradigm
shift in elections administration. Cybersecurity is at the
forefront of elections conversations taking place right now at
every level of government across the country. But before I
continue, I want to recognize and thank Congressman Jim
Langevin for his visionary leadership in elections
administration and his past service as Rhode Island's Secretary
of State and whose shoulders I definitely stand on as I do the
work I do today.
Today Rhode Island, and almost all other States, face new
challenges that can be summarized as follows.
First, although this is not currently the case in Rhode
Island, many elections across our country are being run on
equipment that is either obsolete or near the end of its useful
life; second, our public-sector employees and systems of the
State, county, and municipal levels, are ill-prepared to handle
the looming threats of cyber attacks.
Finally, our country is facing a very real threat by
foreign actors and others looking to erode the public's trust
in the integrity of our elections. These attacks are real and
are focused on undermining our representative democracy.
On behalf of my colleagues who oversee elections across the
country, I do want to thank you for the $380 million in
additional Help America Vote Act funds. However, the challenges
our democracy faces today require an on-going commitment of
funding so election officials can prepare for threats that were
nonexistent 5 years ago.
As these threats involve funding, training and improved
communications are critical to protecting our democracy. This
funding should be flexible. After all, actions addressing this
new landscape of elections and cybersecurity have taken place
in a variety of ways because elections are organized and run
differently in every State.
Having said that, I do believe that our efforts in Rhode
Island over the past 3 years, offer valuable insight into the
challenges and opportunities that election officials face in
this area of increased cyber threats; so, how has Rhode Island
handled these three challenges I described?
First, we replaced outdated voting equipment which was on
the brink of failure. We invested nearly $10 million in new
paper-based elections equipment that has four layers of
security and encryption. Federal assistance was important
throughout all of this process; the election assistance
commission helped us for example with the RFVs for that
equipment. While modernizing the electoral process and
infrastructure, we also leveraged resources offered by the
Department of Homeland Security under the Critical
Infrastructure Designation.
We further protected our central voter registration system.
For example, recently the Department of Homeland Security
performed external penetration testing and vulnerability
scanning to assess any cybersecurity concerns with regards to
our voter registration system. This risk and vulnerability
assessment provided my office with areas that needed to be
improved upon to ensure our system is as secure as possible. We
also looked to the Rhode Island National Guard to provide us
with a security analysis of newly-purchased electronic poll
books during a recent special election.
Our second challenge is one of building the capacity of the
public sector to manage and respond to cyber threats and in our
elections. Some of those services can be outsourced. However,
we need to make sure that Government owns the ability to
protect our democracy. In Rhode Island I have increased my
office's I.T. staff by 40 percent to make sure that we have the
technical expertise in-house to respond to ever shifting
landscape of cybersecurity.
Our work recently received additional help from the Federal
level. Working with the National Association of Secretaries of
State, the Department of Homeland Security provided--initiated
a process for providing two State election officials, like
myself, with the required security clearance and this has been
really helpful.
At this time I do want to also add my congratulations to
Under Secretary Krebs for his appointment, and I also want to
recognize the hire at DHS of former Election Assistance
Commissioner Chairman, Matt Masterson. I believe that really
strengthens the operations and the ability of DHS to work with
the States on cybersecurity and elections.
But building the strength of our election system at the
State level addresses only part of what is needed. Local
election officials are literally on the front lines and must
have the information or resources necessary to identify and
mitigate the emerging threats.
For this reason, in Rhode Island, we are members of the
Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis
Center, the EI-ISAC. Soon all cities and towns in Rhode Island
will be signed up with EI-ISAC which provides election
officials with cybersecurity resources as well as best
practices that enhance the overall strength of election
systems.
As cyber threats continue to evolve and become more
sophisticated, States need additional funding and resources
dedicated to the security of election. These funds have been
critically needed for strengthening the I.T. capacity within
Government, developing testing procedures, and undergoing
third-party assessments.
Our amount of $3 million is being used to invest in our
central voter registration database, strengthening of that
system and--as well as protecting it, and other large portions
can help us develop our first-ever post-election audit systems
in Rhode Island. Finally keeping in mind what I said about
local government, we are to be using part of the $3 million to
initiate an election assistance--elections administration
improvement grant program for cities and towns.
In conclusion, I want to make the following suggestions.
First, Congress should provide on-going funding to the States
so that we remain prepared to face any cybersecurity challenge.
Second, Federal agencies must continue to provide information,
training, and resources to support the work being done to
protect our election systems on a State, county, and local
level.
Congress can help us by formalizing clear communication
channels between the levels of government so that we know what
to expect in the communication of cybersecurity. Finally,
Congress must also continue to provide active oversight in this
area that now recognizes the new balance that must be struck
between the secrecy required for security measures needed to
safeguard our democracy at the same time as we balance it with
a transparency and access to information that ensure an open
government.
Thank you very much for the opportunity to share my
thoughts with you on this and my experiences as Rhode Island's
secretary of state; I look forward to continuing our
conversation.
[The prepared statement of Ms. Gorbea follows:]
Prepared Statement of Nellie M. Gorbea
July 11, 2018
Thank you, Chairman McCaul and Members of the committee, for the
invitation to participate in this important discussion of how to best
address cyber threats to our elections.
I commend your committee for holding this hearing to learn more
about what is being done on the Federal, State, and local levels to
protect our Nation's elections systems and what can be done to improve
upon this work. The advances in technology have brought with them a
paradigm shift in elections administration. Addressing cybersecurity in
elections has become an urgent and relevant matter. Cybersecurity is at
the forefront of elections conversations taking place right now at
every level of government across the country.
Before I continue, I want to recognize my Congressman, Jim
Langevin, for his visionary leadership in elections administration in
his past service as Rhode Island's Secretary of State. Two decades ago,
then-Secretary Langevin led Rhode Island's early adoption of voting
technology that replaced the ancient mechanical Shoup Lever voting
machines with paper-based optical scanners.
In Rhode Island, we are proud of our role as an innovator in
elections technology. In 1936, for example, Rhode Island was the first
State to use voting machines at every polling place across the State,
not just in major cities, as had been the practice at that time across
the country.
As Secretary of State, I am building on that legacy of innovation
and excellence despite the significant challenges that my State and
almost all other States face. These challenges can be summarized as
follows:
1. First, although this is not currently the case in Rhode Island,
many elections across our country are being run on equipment
that is either obsolete or near the end of its useful life.
2. Second, our public-sector employees and systems at the State,
county, and municipal levels are ill-prepared to handle the
looming threat of cyber attacks.
3. Finally, our country is facing a very real threat presented by
foreign actors and others who are conducting activities that
serve to erode the public's trust in the integrity of our
elections. These attacks are real and are focused on
undermining our representative democracy.
Congress recently took an important step to help us address these
challenges by providing $380 million for elections administration and
security in additional Help America Vote Act (HAVA) funds in the
Consolidated Appropriations Act. On behalf of my colleagues who oversee
elections across the country I thank you for this important investment.
I also want to emphasize that the challenges our democracy faces
require an on-going commitment of funds. Elections officials today, are
tasked with preparing for threats that were nonexistent 5 years ago and
are continuously evolving. Funds, training, and improved communication
are critical to ensuring that we continue to protect our democracy.
Actions addressing this new landscape of elections and
cybersecurity have taken place in a variety of ways because elections
are organized and run differently in every State. Nonetheless, I
believe that our efforts in Rhode Island over the past 3 years offer
valuable insight into the challenges and opportunities that elections
officials face in this era of increased cyber threats.
In Rhode Island, while I serve as chief State election official
under HAVA, elections are run in coordination and collaboration between
my office, the Rhode Island State Board of Elections, and local
elections officials with their boards of canvassers. My office, the
Department of State, maintains the Central Voter Registration System
(CVRS), a voter registration database and elections management system
used by all local elections officials that was developed thanks to HAVA
funding during Secretary of State Matthew A. Brown's administration. A
separate agency, the Rhode Island State Board of Elections, oversees
Election Day operations, is responsible for the security of the voting
equipment and handles post-election disputes and audits. Meanwhile,
local elections officials and their boards of canvassers run the polls
on Election Day.
Our collaboration is a key ingredient to successfully running
elections. Over the past year, we have strengthened relationships with
our Federal partners, specifically the Election Assistance Commission
(EAC) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). We have also taken
advantage of State resources such as the cyber unit at the Rhode Island
National Guard and the expertise of faculty members at Salve Regina
University and Brown University.
So how has Rhode Island handled the three challenges I described
above?
First, we addressed the topic of equipment. When I took office in
2015, our voting equipment, purchased in 1997, was on the brink of
total failure. Thankfully, when I confronted them with the problem, the
leadership of our State took this issue seriously--Speaker Nicholas
Mattiello, then Senate President Teresa Paiva Weed and the membership
of the General Assembly, along with Governor Gina Raimondo, all
supported the purchase of new paper-ballot optical scanning machines.
This translated into an investment of nearly $10 million over the next
7 years. The EAC was instrumental in providing us with key advice and
counsel in the development of the Request for Proposals for the new
voting equipment. Because of these efforts Rhode Island entered the
2016 election cycle with new, secure voting machines that have four
layers of security and encryption.
We have also modernized many other aspects of the electoral process
and infrastructure. Over the past 2 years we have implemented on-line
voter registration, acquired electronic poll books, and recently
implemented automated voter registration. These advancements make both
voting and the administration of elections more efficient for all
involved.
While modernizing the electoral process and infrastructure, we also
leveraged resources offered by the Department of Homeland Security
under their critical infrastructure designation, to further protect our
Central Voter Registration System. Recently, DHS performed external
penetration testing and vulnerability scanning to assess any
cybersecurity concerns with regard to our voter registration system.
This Risk and Vulnerability Assessment provided my office with areas
that needed to be improved to ensure our system is as secure as
possible. In addition, the Rhode Island National Guard provided a
security analysis of the electronic poll books (e-poll books), used
during a recent election, to assess possible security vulnerabilities.
But investments in hardware and software cannot be used effectively
if government does not have the human resources that can manage and
operate them. Our second challenge is one of building the capacity of
the public sector to manage and respond to cyber threats in our
elections.
In Rhode Island, I have increased my office's IT staff by 40
percent to ensure that we have the technical expertise in-house
necessary to respond to the ever-shifting landscape that technology
presents. This investment in our State workforce has also allowed us to
deploy on-line tools and resources that not only make our elections
infrastructure more secure, they make it easier for voters to
participate in elections.
It is important to note that security breaches can come through any
connection within a governmental office, even those that may be
physically removed from elections-related infrastructure. That is why
over the past year we have conducted social engineering training, where
our own IT team sends phishing emails to employees to test their
awareness of potentially harmful emails. In addition, all our employees
participated in cybersecurity awareness and threat mitigation training.
These tools teach employees about the dangers of methods that on-line
hackers commonly use to attempt to infect our network.
However, having technically proficient State and local technology
professionals is not enough if we do not have a well-developed
communications structure between DHS and our country's chief State
election officials. Being able to quickly disseminate information on
potential threats and respond effectively is critical to safeguarding
our elections. The National Association of Secretaries of State was
able to persuasively present this issue to the Department of Homeland
Security and, as a result, DHS initiated the process of providing chief
State election officials like myself with the required security
clearance to effectively manage the cybersecurity of elections systems.
While this process of communicating cyberthreat information between DHS
and chief State election officials was admittedly rocky at first, it is
now much improved and will be an important mechanism to share cyber
threat information. At this time, I would like to commend DHS for
bringing on former EAC Chairman Matt Masterson to work with States on
cybersecurity issues. In my experience working with former Chairman
Masterson I have found him to be a consummate professional, and his
thorough knowledge of our country's complex elections systems gives DHS
critically important knowledge for more effective policy making.
Additionally, local elections officials are on the front lines and
must have the information and resources necessary to identify and
mitigate emerging threats. For this reason, in Rhode Island we are
members of the Multi-State Information Sharing and Analysis Center (MS-
ISAC) and the Elections Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis
Center (EI-ISAC). In addition, by the end of next week I expect all our
cities and towns to be signed-up with EI-ISAC. These organizations
provide elections officials with cybersecurity products and services as
well as best practices that enhance the overall strength of our
election systems. For example, the Albert sensor is a device provided
by MS-ISAC that monitors and analyzes all traffic that comes into our
network. The information it collects is scanned and if something
malicious is detected, we are notified.
In Rhode Island, we are also taking steps of our own to ensure full
preparedness. Last month, my office and the State Board of Elections
hosted a seminar for local elections officials that included a
comprehensive tabletop exercise presenting potential scenarios on
Election Day. Elections officials were forced to make quick decisions
under pressure and practice how to handle such situations. The exercise
was based on a similar program my team attended at Harvard University's
Belfer Center.
Last year, I convened more than a hundred of Rhode Island's local
elections officials and IT staff for a summit on elections
cybersecurity. Several industry and academic experts in the field of
cybersecurity, as well as Congressman Langevin, provided briefings
during the summit. One important message that we focused on that day
with local elections officials is that cybersecurity is not a
destination; it is a continuous process of assessment, improvement of
our systems, and mitigation of risk.
This is why we must bring together all stakeholders, regardless of
political affiliations, to continually identify threats and work on
solutions. This is not a far-fetched ideal. In fact, IT leaders from
Google and Facebook have commented that the top technology companies in
our country regularly collaborate on cyberthreat information facing
their companies despite being fierce competitors. We must develop a
similar protocol in the public sector to share information on cyber
threats. In Rhode Island, I have focused on ensuring that our elections
officials and staff at every level have the information necessary to
minimize cybersecurity threats.
Investment in training of our public-sector employees has become a
critical need. As cyber threats continue to evolve and become more
sophisticated, States need additional funding and resources dedicated
to the security of elections systems. These funds are necessary for
third-party assessments, testing procedures, and strengthening IT
capacity. The HAVA funds approved by Congress in the recently-passed
Appropriations Act are an important initial investment in such systems.
Using Rhode Island as an example, I would like to take a minute to
discuss some of the critical initiatives that we are investing in with
the new HAVA funds.
One of our key priorities is to secure the registry of
voters. Prior to the 2018 election we plan to invest over
$500,000 in cybersecurity enhancements to our CVRS.
The new funds also enable us to rewrite our CVRS
application, originally developed in 2004 and 2005, to current
industry best-practice standards and help us protect against
penetration attempts.
Understanding that trust in elections results is critical,
we will fund the first-ever post-election audits in Rhode
Island. This law was passed by our legislature in 2017 and is
another step in ensuring the integrity of our elections.
Ensuring that municipalities also improve their systems and
help protect our elections, we will initiate an Elections
Administration Improvement Grant Program for cities and towns
to make election security enhancements on a local level.
In conclusion, I would like to make the following suggestions:
Congress can play a critical role by providing on-going
funding to the States so that we remain prepared to face any
cybersecurity challenge. As I mentioned above, the additional
HAVA funds approved earlier this year are welcome and much
needed by jurisdictions across the country. However, sustained
funding is necessary for elections officials to modernize their
systems to enhance the integrity and security of our elections.
Federal agencies must continue to provide important training
and resources to support the work being done on a State and
local level to protect our elections systems.
Congress also can formalize clear communication channels
between Federal agencies and State and local governments to
share cyber threats and information to assist in preparing for
any outside interference in our elections. The Federal
Government should recognize that it can play a critical
advisory and support role in securing elections infrastructure
while respecting the fact that elections are the responsibility
of State and local elections officials. It is my firm belief
that improving the integrity of elections systems can be
achieved while simultaneously improving access to voting.
Finally, Congress must also provide oversight of Federal
intelligence and security agencies recognizing the important
balance that must be kept between security measures needed to
safeguard our democracy and the transparency and access to
information that preserve our ability to have open government
and elections that can be trusted.
Thank you again for the opportunity to present testimony on the
work we are doing in Rhode Island and how the Federal Government can
work with States to ensure our Nation's elections systems are secure
and our democracy safeguarded.
Chairman McCaul. Thank you, Secretary.
I now recognize myself for 5 minutes of questioning. In
October 2016, the Ranking Member and I sat in what is called a
Gang of Eight briefing with the DNI Director Clapper and
Secretary of Homeland Jeh Johnson.
We were briefed at that time, in a Classified setting.
Since then, the information has been made public that Russia
was attempting to meddle in our elections using a campaign and
information warfare model. I would--I would have to say it was
very disturbing. I think I speak for the Ranking Member, as
well.
I urged, then at that time, that--the previous
administration to call out Russia for what they were doing and
that there should be consequences to their actions. I have also
said the same thing to this administration that Russia needs to
be called out and there should be consequences. Congress passed
sanctions--harsh sanctions against Russia for their conduct.
With that, Mr. Krebs, I want to ask you if you--as we move
into the 2016--or 2018 mid-term elections, can you tell me what
the threat level is from foreign adversaries and foreign
nation-states to potentially meddle in the upcoming elections?
Under Secretary Krebs. So, as I mentioned in my opening
statement, we have not seen anything, certainly, to the degree
of 2016 in terms of specific hacking of election systems. I
think at this point it is--it is important to--to distinguish
or differentiate between directed technical attacks against
I.T. systems, much like what we saw in 2016 with the--the
database--the voter registration database is the scanning.
That is the cybersecurity technical piece of it. Then,
there's also an information operations element of it. I think
that is fairly well-characterized in the intelligence community
assessment.
We are, again, not seeing, on either hand, something that
rises to--anything that rises from--to the level of 2016
directed, focused, robust campaign, but we do see continued
Russian activities. The intelligence community continues to see
Russian activity in the sowing discord across the American
public.
It is not, again, directed, necessarily, at politicians or
political campaigns, but it is focused on identifying divisive
issues, and sowing discord, and creating chaos, and, frankly,
undermining democracy.
Chairman McCaul. So there will be more of this campaign
information or disinformation warfare?
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, sir, that is the way I would
characterize it. We are seeing more along the lines of
information operations rather than directed technical attacks
or anything focusing on elections of, particularly, the mid-
terms.
Chairman McCaul. So, that leads me to the--the
vulnerabilities in the election system itself. You don't see
any targeted technical attacks toward, say, the voting
machines?
Under Secretary Krebs. In terms of the--just stepping back
a little bit on the voting machines and I, you now, of course
would defer to Secretary Gorbea and what she has seen in Rhode
Island, we are--voting systems in and of themselves are systems
of systems.
So, we have the voting day which is what people, typically,
think of with e-poll books and optical scanning machines or the
DREs. Then, you have a broader system that supports the
backend, the information management systems that store voter
registration. Just like any I.T. system, there--there are going
to be vulnerabilities just by the very nature of it.
There are a series of compensating controls even on DREs
that can limit risk. Ultimately, what we are looking for, here,
is not a 100 percent secure system. Just like any I.T. system,
there is no such thing as a secure I.T. system. What we are
looking for is resilience in the system.
To think about this, maybe, in a different way is, over the
course of the last couple of months through primaries, there
have been a number of issues with I.T. systems and California
had a voter printout, about 118,000 voters across 1,000
precincts in L.A. County, and then just recently in Maryland,
there was an issue with transferring registration information
from the DMV to the Secretary of State--State's office.
What we are really seeing there more than anything is that,
yes, there are technical challenges, but the way the system is
engineered or architected, in part due to work by Congress, and
HAVA in particular, is that even if you showed up to vote and
your registration had been, whether accidentally or
intentionally, deleted from a voter registration file, you have
the ability to request a provisional ballot.
So, if, in 2016, when the Russians were in the Illinois
State registration database, had they deleted voter
registration files, Illinois citizens would have been able to
show up. If their information had been deleted, they still
would have been able to request a provisional ballot. They
would have cast their ballot; it would have been counted as
cast. So, this, again, it is not 100 percent security. We are
looking to achieve resilience in the system.
Chairman McCaul. Secretary, how resilient do you believe
the--your State's system is?
Ms. Gorbea. Our system is actually very resilient and I
share Under Secretary Krebb's description of what we are
looking for is resilience and not foolproof security. So, we
have a series of mitigating factors. One is, of course,
protecting the systems. Each city and town has its own
structures of how to then transfer that information to the
central--but what Under Secretary Krebs described is, very
much, what is happening in Rhode Island today.
In addition, we have been able to leverage resources, not
just from the Federal level but for our own National Guard so
that we are constantly testing the security of systems at the
same time as we, sort-of, think of the what-if. What if
something happens?
So, for example, recently we had a mock disaster day with
all of the clerks in the cities and towns to try to go through
what happens if you show up on Election Day and you discover
that there has been some tampering? What would--how would you
respond?
We hadn't done that before this year because it hadn't
really come up. So, you have to get people at the local and
municipal level to start thinking in this way which goes to my
point about----
Chairman McCaul. My time is, kind-of----
Ms. Gorbea. Oh, sorry.
Chairman McCaul. Expired. But I--let me just say, in terms
of the voting machines themselves, most of them--these machines
are not connected to the internet now. They are disconnected?
Ms. Gorbea. So, the description of whether or not they are
connected is an interesting one because that, also, has changed
over time. Most machines are individual and there is a modem
transmission for some of them, for example, at the end of the
day, that transmits the results. But there are back-ups to that
and in the case of Rhode Island, the most important back-up, of
course, is the paper ballot.
Chairman McCaul. But everything is always front-based going
back to the premise of my question, you don't see this
technical threat currently?
Ms. Gorbea. In terms of the voting systems in Rhode Island,
no.
Chairman McCaul. From a foreign adversary?
Ms. Gorbea. From foreign adversaries, no. I do think that--
I mean we front-loaded our investment into voting machines and
that made a big difference in our----
Chairman McCaul. And Under Secretary, you and I talked
previously about Members of Congress--how--how safe are we from
foreign adversary attacks and how--how protected are we on our
networks?
Under Secretary Krebs. So everyone has a different model. I
think given the sensitivity of the information, the policy
shaping that this body engages in, I think that it is safe to
say that a foreign adversary from a pure intelligence
perspective would probably want to know what you guys are doing
on a daily basis, what policies you are driving.
In terms of how you are positioned from a security
perspective, I don't have frankly in-depth knowledge of your
I.T. systems given the separation of powers but happy to
provide a briefing on, in part, best practices, but also work
with the CIO. I think we are doing some engagement on how we
can collaborate and help Congress secure their networks.
Chairman McCaul. I think that would be helpful. I think
most Members have no idea how vulnerable they really are to
these attacks.
So with that, I recognize the Ranking Member.
Mr. Thompson. Yes, I agree with you because we have been in
some hearings--some briefings who really laid out some kind-of
scary scenarios. Well, you are--you are official now, Mr.
Krebs, welcome.
Just from a historical standpoint, how many States have we
identified that the Russians did some form of intrusion in the
last elections?
Under Secretary Krebs. So when we think back to 2016, there
are a couple ways we have to, kind-of, hash out the information
it is all based on frankly awareness visibility into activity
and infrastructure. So we have thrown around numbers--18 were
either accessed or scanned or targeted or 21, whatever it is.
Last summer we--we gave 21, when I--that number, 21 that were
scanned, that information is based on the telemetry, the
visibility into traffic over networks that we had, that,
frankly, that we had visibility to last year.
If you were to ask me what I really thought happened, I
would suspect, and Jeannette--Assistant Secretary Manfra said
this and I believe Secretary Nielsen said this too, I--I would
suspect that the Russians probably scanned all 50 States and 5
territories and the District of Columbia. Scanning, it happens
every day; it is an automated process. I just again, I think
based on the 21 number, that is not what we were able to see.
We have better visibility going in to 2018. We basically have--
will have access to close to 50 percent of visible--I am sorry,
100 percent visibility into at least the State networks.
Mr. Thompson. So is that scanning considered a
vulnerability?
Under Secretary Krebs. The scanning is a threat; a
vulnerability would reside in the system. The scanning is the
actual foreign adversary's actions to look for vulnerabilities.
Mr. Thompson. So since whether it is 18, 21 or whatever,
how many States have we worked with to identify, help them
identify potential threats or whatever?
Under Secretary Krebs. So at this point, sir, we are
working with all 50 States. We have all 50 States as members of
the Election Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis
Center. That is since February when we stood up the I-ISAC
close to 1,000 total members of the I-ISAC at this point, and
that is 50 States plus local jurisdictions, counties, in
associations like NAS----
Mr. Thompson. So your testimony is that everybody is
cooperating?
Under Secretary Krebs. There are levels of cooperation. As
always, everybody has different capabilities of the State level
and different resourcing as well. But at this moment I can say
that all 50 States are participating in the I-ISAC.
Mr. Thompson. Explain resourcing.
Under Secretary Krebs. Sir, resourcing would be how they
are funded at the State level. You know, Secretary Gorbea is
fortunate to have resources provided by the State treasury that
she could in 2016, or prior to 2016, replace her outdated
equipment. Not all States are similarly resourced and that is
going to be a challenge going forward and I think that is
probably the greatest opportunity for policy discussion.
Mr. Thompson. Madam Secretary, you talked to some of your
colleagues around the country I am sure on this. Can you shed a
little light on the resourcing?
Ms. Gorbea. Yes, I can absolutely vouch for the fact that
the equipment is just the tip of the iceberg; it is the one
that is easy to fix quickly, right? Because you know that it is
outdated, you know that it is not up to code and you can
replace it any time.
I think the second layer of resourcing that is really
important is the public sector rank-and-file people who are
working in this in Government. We at some point need to invest
in making sure that the people at the local level--you can have
fabulous resources at the Federal level at DHS, but if they
don't have anyone to engage with at the local level on the
security on what all of this means, then you are--you are
basically going blind.
So I think that there's, it is two-piece; one is the
equipment and the other one is the human resources.
Mr. Thompson. So we talked a little bit about this re-
siloing that is occurring. Give us your opinion about how you
see that, pro or con, in terms of the cyber, Under Secretary?
Under Secretary Krebs. Thank you for the question. I think
this one's pretty clear. The Homeland Security Act 2003
provided the Secretary of Homeland Security very clear
authorities to lead the critical infrastructure protection
activities of the--across the Federal Government in
coordination with sector-specific agencies, the intelligence
community, and law enforcement.
So I think to the extent that we are creating duplicative,
whether it is liability protections or information sharing or
information--integration centers, I think that is having a
negative effect. It is in some cases it could put us into
something along the lines of a pre-9/11 position where we don't
have that integration.
That is why in my opening statement said several times that
DHS is an information and operations integrator. That is our
role.
Mr. Thompson. Right. So in other words it would make us
less secure?
Under Secretary Krebs. That is my belief, yes, sir.
Mr. Thompson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields back.
The gentleman from New York, Mr. King, is recognized.
Mr. King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank both witnesses
for testifying here today and Secretary Krebs, I wish you the
very best and, Secretary Gorbea, thank you for your efforts in
Rhode Island and for working with my good friend Mr. Langevin.
When we talk about cyber activity by the Russians, today we
seem to be focusing obviously on the attempts to hack the
election systems, but also they have distorted information and
attempted to influence people. What is being done in that and
who has primary jurisdiction over that?
Under Secretary Krebs. So as I said earlier on, we do look
at things that the technical hacking and then the information
operations DHS has lead for supporting State and local
governments, and the information--or I am sorry--in a hacking
space. FBI has lead in countering foreign interference and
the--in the information operations space. DHS does support the
FBI's efforts as does of course the intelligence community.
Mr. King. It--do you want to add to that?
Ms. Gorbea. No, I--they really do have the best information
on--particularly the information warfare stuff.
Mr. King. Right, and how's the level of cooperation with
the FBI and DHS in that?
Ms. Gorbea. So most recently, we did have a meeting in
February with the Office of the Director of National
Intelligence, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security that
was incredibly helpful to secretaries of state across the
country that were altogether for their annual meeting.
That kind of information is--is critical. We can't--part of
the challenge here with elections is elections are
decentralized. So--and I think we suffered some, you know,
beginning stumbling, you know, when all of this came together.
Where a locality was being informed of a potential breach
or activities, and the chief State election officials who
happened to be secretaries of state didn't know about it.
Those--those communication activities between the Federal and
the local and the State level, I think have smoothed out
considerably over the last several months as we have learned to
get along. The other challenge is that as elected officials, we
deal in the world of transparency and open government.
Mr. King. Right.
Ms. Gorbea. DHS works in a very different mode. That is
attention that we need to be conscious of and to make sure that
we make--we accept the adequate provisions for.
Mr. King. We also know that Russia is interfering in
elections throughout Europe, more elections coming up, more
meddling expected. How much information does DHS share with our
foreign allies and foreign countries on this and how closely do
we work with them?
Under Secretary Krebs. I--it is difficult to quantify how
much information we share, but I do know that over the last
year or so with various campaigns that happened in Europe,
whether it was France or Germany, we do have cert-to-cert
relationships, where we can share technical indicators of known
command-and-control infrastructure of Russian adversaries.
So we can help them--we will share what we know, they will
share what they know, so I do feel as if it is a good
relationship in terms of the engagement.
Mr. King. As far as Rhode Island, you may have covered this
in your opening statement but how much cooperation is there
among the States as far as, you know, you sitting down with
other secretaries of state?
Ms. Gorbea. So the National Association of Secretaries of
State provides an excellent coming together on a bipartisan
basis so that we can have these conversations about what is
happening. We have also under that advocacy--or not--group--
bipartisan group have provided a space for our own I.T.
officials with our rank-and-file civil servants to be able to
have conversations around security issues and what are best
practices. Those are critically important in this day and age.
Mr. King. Without having to name names, are there other
secretaries of state who resist this, who feel that this plot
is over--you know, threat is overblown?
Ms. Gorbea. No, I don't think that anybody at this point,
well, for the most part, I think everybody agrees that there is
some level of threat; I think that was made very clear in our
security briefing afternoon. There are more tensions around
this issue of the communications with the Federal Government
and where--and how do we go about finding out what is happening
in our own States so that we can help proactively address the
issues at a local level.
Mr. King. Yes.
Secretary, you want to add anything to that?
Under Secretary Krebs. I think that is spot-on, as I
mentioned in my opening, everyone understands that the threat
is real. The challenge here is, again, goes to the resourcing
issue. If I provide information, what can be done about it?
To the point of the Classified information and how we
engage, I aim on a daily basis to operate as much in the
unclassified space as possible so that the products that I push
out are immediately actionable by broad communities. So it
doesn't help me if I am--as Secretary Gorbea pointed out, if I
am living in a Classified space. That should not be the DHS
mission space; we should be managing risk in an unclassified
manner that is informed by threat intelligence.
Mr. King. Secretary Krebs, Gorbea, thank you very much.
I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman McCaul. Gentleman yields.
The gentleman from Rhode Island, Mr. Langevin is
recognized.
Mr. Langevin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,
Ranking Member Thompson, and to Secretary Krebs and Secretary
Gorbea, thank you again for your testimony and all the work
that you are doing to enhance election security across the
country.
Mr. Krebs, let me start with you. As you know, the 2018
omnibus provided additional HAVA funding for State election
officials to better secure their systems in advance of the mid-
terms. Do you believe that the States are using these Federal
dollars--States using these Federal dollars are making risk-
informed decisions on how to spend them?
Under Secretary Krebs. So I do believe that States are
using the money in a manner that addresses their threat model,
their risks scenario. I would not though assume that all that
money is going to replace out-of-date equipment. There are
challenges from a procurement perspective; there are also the
challenge for it is frankly not enough money to transition that
equipment.
What we have done working with States and informed in part
by our risk and vulnerability assessments is working with DHS,
working with EAC and with the Government Coordinating Council--
put together a list of recommended expenditures.
So if you have got this money from the omnibus, the $380
million a year distribution, here are good ways to spend it.
There are things as simple as hiring what we are calling a
cyber navigator, someone that actually has cybersecurity
expertise that can get out from your State capital and go work
with the various counties.
Because that is the real challenge here, is that when you
think about across the Nation, there's close to, if not over,
10,000 jurisdictions and there's not enough cybersecurity
expertise to go around as it stands, so let's--let's continue
to invest in that.
But it is also things like training, exercises, response
planning, patching systems, updating operating systems, things
like that.
Mr. Langevin. So the list you mentioned certainly is
helpful because it is broad; it is not specific to their
systems per se. I guess my--what I would ask, would
requirements that States conduct risk assessments before using
the Federal dollars help to ensure maximum efficacy to improve
their cybersecurity posture?
Under Secretary Krebs. So I think that that is certainly
something that we would consider, and we of course, offer the
risk and vulnerability assessments to the States at this point.
We have conducted about 17 of them; we have another one that is
in the process.
But absent the other 31 being completed, or 32 being
completed, we are taking the lessons learned, the observations
from those risk and vulnerability assessments, and we are
sharing those broadly through the ISAC and through our day-to-
day engagement. So for those States that don't--haven't done an
RVA may not want to do an RVA because they have some other
capability, we are going ahead and taking the learnings that we
got from the RVA that Rhode Island did and we are pushing that
out more broadly.
Again, that is what informed the recommended expenditures
or the guidance that we developed with the GCC. So that is a
good way of--and--and to be clear, that through all of those
risks and vulnerability assessments we saw pretty much the same
thing: Out-of-date operating systems, patch management
challenges, and lack of awareness across staff. These are all
things that we can address through, initially, through the--the
HAVA money, but then on-going DHS support.
Mr. Langevin. Thank you. I think that some of those things
are very helpful. I think that the requirements for risk
assessments would be a best way to use the funds, and I will
mention that--I want to point out to the Chairman that the
bipartisan PAPER Act that I have introduced with Congressman
Mark Meadows contains provisions that will require these kinds
of assessments, so----
But Secretary Gorbea, in your testimony you spoke about the
need for continued cybersecurity training of State and local
election officials. So can you elaborate on the nature of the
training that is needed, and in particular, about the resources
you hope DHS can provide?
Ms. Gorbea. Yes. Yes, so basically, we are only as strong
as our weakest link. While I have been able to really improve
the--the cybersecurity at our--in the Department of State,
truth is, is that elections in Rhode Island are run also at the
local boards of canvassers, as well as the State Board of
Elections. So what we have encountered is, once you deal with a
hardware issue, you have to deal with the people, as well. DHS
has been particularly helpful in helping us navigate through
all of that.
I also want to give a shout out, though, to the Election
Assistance Commission because when we were looking for new
voting equipment, they were there to help us, also, with best
practices. I think that is a perfect role for the Federal
Government with locals. The locals know, the State people know
where their needs are most pressing.
The training that we have done in Rhode Island involves
everything from a cyber summit that you participated in about a
year ago, where we--where we basically walked through, why are
we having these conversations around cybersecurity? For
somebody who's a clerk, who's handling everything from fishing
licenses, to other types of licenses, to voter registration, it
may not be clear to them why they need to be, you know,
safeguarding that password for the central voter registration
system, where they are in--when they are doing, you know, voter
registrations.
So we had a big conversation with the local officials, and
which we will continuously do every 6 months, and as part of
every single training that we do out of the Department of State
to help build that capacity at the local level.
Mr. Langevin. Thank you very much. I know that my time
expired. I want to thank you both for your testimony.
Mr. Chairman, I know, as my time is expired, I would like
to submit this question for the record: On April 24, Assistant
Secretary Jeanette Manfra testified that the surge in risk and
vulnerability assessments for election infrastructure created a
significant backlog in other critical infrastructure sectors
and Federal agencies waiting for similar assessments. The
President's 2019 budget did not request an increase in
resources sufficient to overcome this backlog.
So my question would be, are--are more resources necessary
to support the increased requests from State and local
governments without delaying other assessments, or do you
expect RVA backlogs to be the new normal at NPPD? I will submit
that for the record, since my time is expired.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields.
The gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Rogers, is recognized.
Mr. Rogers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Secretary Krebs, I have been surprised that so many
Americans have acted shocked that Russia was meddling in our
election, when they have been meddling in elections all across
the globe in countries, particularly European countries, and
most specifically, Eastern European countries that used to be a
part of the USSR, and they do this primarily through
disinformation. Many people in America may not realize that
R.T. is Russia Today, and it is propaganda too.
My question is, since disinformation is their tool of
choice, or their weapon of choice, in meddling in elections
across the globe, do you have somebody in your department, or
is it your department's job to counter this disinformation when
you find it in our country? If not, what department does have
that responsibility?
Under Secretary Krebs. So as I mentioned earlier, the way
we look at it, again, is the technical hacking piece, and then
there's the information operations, DHS leads the cybersecurity
working with State and local. FBI leads information operations,
but DHS does support. So FBI's role working with the
intelligence community is identifying specific actors, whether
it is Twitter handles or whatever it is, and disrupting those
activities.
Now, that is only part of the problem, is actually taking
down the disruptive activity, because frankly, with
disinformation, the way to counter disinformation is actually
shine light on the activity. So what we are doing at DHS
working with others in the State Department Global Engagement
Center, working with the FBI, is to build a greater
understanding and awareness of what their activities are,
engaging social media companies, engaging traditional media and
sharing our findings, our trends. Here are the things that they
are doing. How do we raise awareness across the American
public?
This is one of those cases that it is different from
traditional cybersecurity, because cybersecurity--elections,
for instance. What we are aiming for is resilience in the
system so we can take a lick, and we can keep going forward.
Disinformation's completely different. It is--the objective
is anti-fragility, and what that means is unlike resilience,
where you just want to keep moving through it, with anti-
fragility you want to come back stronger; where you learned
from the experience, or that engagement, we learned in 2016--
that we learned, and we closed out that avenue of influence.
That is where we are aiming for.
So we are doing a good bit of trend analysis of how we are
seeing Russian actors engage through information campaigns
and--and operations, and looking for opportunities of
intervention to close out those--those avenues.
Mr. Rogers. So when you say, ``we,'' are you talking about
just DHS, or----
Under Secretary Krebs. No, sir. It is, it is a whole--it is
a cross-government agency. I, in my operation and NPPD, working
with the Intelligence Analysis Directorate, the Privacy Office,
the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Office of DHS, among
others, we have established a Countering Foreign Influence Task
Force, and they--we are looking at some of the--the unique
authorities the Department has.
That works in coordination with the FBI's Foreign Influence
Task Force, and it is also supported by the intelligence
community and the State Department; so it is--everybody has a
role in this, given the unique authorities and the, well,
frankly, the unique authorities of the various agencies.
Mr. Rogers. Thank you.
Secretary Gorbea, you talked about replacing all of your
voting machines in the State. How much did it cost to do that?
Ms. Gorbea. $10 million.
Mr. Rogers. How much of that was State money?
Ms. Gorbea. All of it.
Mr. Rogers. All of it was State money?
Ms. Gorbea. Yes.
Mr. Rogers. No Federal money was used?
Ms. Gorbea. No Federal money was used.
Mr. Rogers. Have you received any Federal money for any
security improvements?
Ms. Gorbea. Yes. Well, where we will be using the $3
million HAVA funds to continue now to really tackle our central
voter registration system, which was developed with, actually,
the first batch of HAVA monies. So that application will be
rewritten and strengthened.
Mr. Rogers. Now, you mentioned earlier in your opening
statement that you needed to make some improvements to your
central database. What exactly are you talking about?
Ms. Gorbea. So just for the protections. You know, our--the
focus of our risk vulnerability assessment was actually our
central voter registration database, to make sure that we
didn't know of open doors throughout our systems that somebody
might come in through. So that was----
Mr. Rogers. Is it connected to a network?
Ms. Gorbea. Yes, and--actually I must say we actually now
have trained all of our staff and continue to do on-going
training to every--whether you are in the archives of the
secretary of state's office or in business services, is to
identify phishing e-mails, things like that, so everybody's on
their toes to not click on something that might compromise our
elections.
Mr. Rogers. Excellent, thank you very much, thank you all
for being here, I yield back.
Chairman McCaul. Gentleman yields back, the gentlelady from
New Jersey, Mrs. Watson Coleman is recognized.
Mrs. Watson Coleman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Congratulations to you, Mr. Krebs, and thank you for being
here, Madam Secretary. I just--I have got a couple of
questions. Is it possible that Russia could be doing something
right now that would interfere with this 2018 election and we
might not know about it yet?
Could they possibly be involved some way now, or is it just
too early?
Mr. Krebs. You know, again, like I mentioned, we haven't
seen anything certainly on the level of 2016, neither on the
direct hacking. We do know that they are launching--they are
carrying out generally speaking information operations.
You know, I--this is kind-of one of those, you know, I
don't know what I don't know right now.
Mrs. Watson Coleman. How many months in advance was this
hacking identified before the 2016? Was it 3 months before, 2
months before, 5 months before?
Under Secretary Krebs. That was before my time at the
Department, I was still in the private sector.
Mrs. Watson Coleman. Would you know, though, this----
Under Secretary Krebs. It was over the course of the summer
I believe prior to the 2016.
Mrs. Watson Coleman. OK so it is really this summer that we
need----
Under Secretary Krebs. It was--you know, I think the real,
as I recall, the real indicators of activity took place about
this time July 2016.
Mrs. Watson Coleman. It is really confusing to me, all of
the various agencies that are--have a piece of this. So is
there like a routine meeting that you all have around these
issues?
Under Secretary Krebs. So in terms of the cybersecurity
piece, yes, ma'am. We have developed a government coordinating
council that brings not just Federal agencies together, but
also State and local partners.
So in that, it is a weekly meeting that DHS, the Election
Assistance Commission, but also, you know, I am of the mind
that when it is just the Federal Government working together on
a problem, you are not getting a lot done because the Federal
Government doesn't always have all the answers.
We need to work with our stakeholders, again, as I said in
my opening statement, to understand what their requirements are
so that we can tailor our services to address their needs. That
is really the mantra that I have instituted across NPPD, it is
requirements-based.
Mrs. Watson Coleman. Do you think or even do you think,
Madam Secretary, based upon your involvement, that all 50
States are equally concerned, engaged, and willing to
participate as rigorously as possible to ensure that our
infrastructure, voting infrastructure is protected, and our
voters votes are counted?
Ms. Gorbea. So I cannot speak for all 50 States, I can tell
you that at the National Association of Secretaries of State,
these issues have been highlighted and discussed more so than I
ever thought when I was running for secretary of state.
Mrs. Watson Coleman. Well, like the President still doesn't
believe that this is happening because Vladimir Putin has told
him that it hasn't. In your sort-of interactions, are there any
States that kind of are where the President is on this, that it
really didn't happen, it is crap, or does everyone recognize
except for the President that this did happen?
Ms. Gorbea. I personally have not had any conversations
that--that way.
Mrs. Watson Coleman. So $38 million has been appropriated
to help various States protect their systems or do whatever
they have to do. Does that include money going down into the
municipalities and the counties to train people, to do the
audits that need to be done, to replace the equipment that
needs to be replaced, Mr. Krebs?
Under Secretary Krebs. So the $380 million in the fiscal
year 2018 omnibus is a broad--is available for a broad set of--
--
Mrs. Watson Coleman. But it can--it goes to the States and
then the States will decide how to spend it?
Under Secretary Krebs. I believe that is correct----
Ms. Gorbea. That is correct, and it is--there is actually a
fair--while there are guidance and sort-of big buckets of
categories, it is really allowed--it really allows the chief
State election official to allocate it in the best way
possible----
Mrs. Watson Coleman. So it is been indicated that the
States have suggested a $380 million, while a lot of money is
not adequate. Do you have any idea what that number should be,
from their perspective?
Ms. Gorbea. Not--not off-hand, although I can use Rhode
Island as an example for exempt. So we are receiving $3
million, our replacement alone, voting systems of the machines,
was $10 million.
Mrs. Watson Coleman. That was purely State money.
Ms. Gorbea. That is right.
Mrs. Watson Coleman. So if a State doesn't have it, and
this $380 million could be legitimately used for it, it seems
like it really could be a lot more depending upon how many
States have the capacity to do this and want to do it.
Ms. Gorbea. Yes, that is correct.
Mrs. Watson Coleman. OK, thank you, thank you, I yield
back. Thank you, Mr. Chair.
Chairman McCaul. The gentlelady yields, the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, Mr. Perry is recognized.
Mr. Perry. Thanks, Mr. Chairman, and congratulations,
Secretary, and welcome, Madam Secretary, appreciate your
presence. I just want to make sure I understand the playing
field in--in the context that Russia or the USSR in its
previous version has been involved in the United States and
undermining the United States since 1917, since the Bolshevik
revolution.
I mean, and the history of the Venona transcripts and
recepts show that they infiltrated our Government at the very,
very highest levels and influence policy in magnificent effect
in the decades past.
But under--so this is nothing new, but in the current
context, Madam Secretary, in particular, do we know of--and,
Secretary, if you know, their incursion into the most recent
Federal election, the Presidential election, they didn't change
any of the votes as far as I know, right.
We are talking about information gathering and--but I think
in the greater sense, they are--we are talking about propaganda
and influence operations as opposed to vote tampering or
changing. Am I correct in that assessment?
Under Secretary Krebs. So from the extent of our
understanding in 2016--rather, the extent of their access was
to voter registration database that was not a vote count, it
was well kind-of left of voting day. So they were able to get
into a State voter registration database and exfiltrate some
data.
Mr. Perry. Their interest in looking at the voter database
so to speak was to then provide propaganda or information to
key voters or to target----
Under Secretary Krebs. I am not actually sure that is--that
that was their intent. In fact, I think to a certain extent,
they didn't know necessarily what they were looking at. They
were in a certain--to a certain--perhaps mucking around in a
system, trying to figure out where they had landed and where
they were.
And understand frankly how the systems worked and how they
interoperated. But to be clear, we did not see them having
access to any machines, equipment, or whatever that was
involved in voter--vote tallying.
Mr. Perry. It is because of the lack of network access and
decentralization of the voting system among States that even if
they would have wanted to, they figured out where they were and
they wanted to influence I would have been very, very
difficult.
That is my understanding, but I want to clarify that, or
have you----
Under Secretary Krebs. That is certainly a contributing
factor, yes sir.
Secretary Perry. OK, and so at this point other than access
to voter registration, we don't know what their intent was and
they don't at this point admit that they were ever even
involved right? They still don't admit that they were ever
involved but we are fairly confident that they were. Is that
correct?
Under Secretary Krebs. The intelligence community
assessment from 2017 was pretty clear that they did intend to
interfere, yes sir.
Mr. Perry. But we don't know in what way they----
Under Secretary Krebs. In what way, I would have to go back
and do a dig back into the ICA, but----
Mr. Perry. OK. I think that is important to know to inform
us of future elections. I don't suspect since they deny
currently that they were even involved, that they will ever
admit that they are probably going to try to stay involved and
continue to be involved as they have since for the last 100
years essentially. Right? They are probably going to--so it
would be important to know I would think to get an assessment
of what they were seeking to do if they did in fact get in. We
should know that so we could safeguard in the future.
But let us go to the Countering Foreign Influence Task
Force that you talked about regarding propaganda and
disinformation. We have got an election coming up in about 4
months. Will that organization be prepared at that time to
inform, by whatever method it decides and determines is
appropriate, the American public of things like Russia today or
ads on social media, etcetera to influence, via propaganda, the
American electorate? Will that task force be prepared at that
time to be engaged?
Under Secretary Krebs. Some of my task force I wouldn't
think of it as an incident response capability, I think of it
more as an analytical cell. See what the activities they do
over time, what their tactics, techniques, and procedures are
and build up a body of knowledge to then share generally
speaking. Here are the sorts of things they do. These are the
sorts of things that the American public should be on the
lookout for. Other agencies have the more tactical response of
we are seeing, for instance, the Internet Research Agency
perhaps do activity X, Y, or Z, that is where the FBI becomes
involved; that is where other agencies become involved, it is
more tactical----
Mr. Perry. OK so I think I have a clear understanding of
that but what I am missing and I think some other Members might
be missing is once we have that information, once we have that
track record, then what? Who is going to inform the American
people of this advertisement is specifically coming from a
propaganda source whether it is Russia or some other hostile
Nation or adversarial Nation and to be suspicious of it. Whose
job in the American--in the Federal Government or State and
local governments is it to do that informing of the citizenry?
Under Secretary Krebs. So this is in part a Government and
industry collaboration. So where we have social media companies
working with Government we will be able to identify that
information whether to flag it or take it down similar to
terrorists use the internet where they remove content, disable
accounts, that sort of activity can happen on the private-
sector side and on the industry side.
Mr. Perry. So it is planned solely on the private sector?
Under Secretary Krebs. No sir, it is--this is truly a
partnership. This is going to be the Government will be taking
certain actions then the private sector will be taking certain
actions. I think if you look at what Twitter has done over the
last week or so or last month, couple months, where they have
disabled 70 million accounts by press reports at least. I think
that is the sort of activity you will see happening going
forward.
Mr. Perry. OK, thanks Mr. Chairman I yield.
Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields. The gentlelady from
Florida, Mrs. Demings is recognized.
Mrs. Demings. Thank you so much Mr. Chairman and thank you
to both of you for being here with us today. Congratulations,
Mr. Under Secretary, and thank you so much for the work that
you are doing in Rhode Island as well.
Let me just say I--we have heard a lot about what happened
in 2016 with our election and I grew up in Florida and Florida
is the State that kind of keeps everyone up all night,
especially on general election night. I just, I think everybody
here understands the importance of protecting our systems but
let me just say this. I grew up in Florida. I represent a
district in Florida.
When I think about my parents, my mother was a maid and my
father was a janitor, but I cannot remember a time they did not
exercise their right to vote and I think they were so dedicated
because they understood that regardless of the color of their
skin or where they lived or how much money they did not have in
the bank that their vote mattered, it counted and it counted as
much as any billionaire or millionaire in this country. So why
wouldn't we especially, as one of the most powerful bodies in
the world, in Congress want to protect this basic right for
every American?
So I do thank you for the work that you are doing to
further that goal. Under Secretary, I was a little bit
surprised as we look at I think the viciousness and consistency
of Russia and other foreign powers that want to attack our
system, that more States had not taken advantage of the full
array of resources that DHS offers.
I know that--I believe you said 17 have participated in the
risk vulnerability assessments. When we think about--a No. 1, I
would like to know, what you think you could do to encourage
more States to participate, even though it is that they have
the option the ability to opt in or not and also for State like
Florida, if they did today call and say they want the
vulnerability risk assessment done, how soon could you get that
done?
Under Secretary Krebs. So to your first question, what can
we do more of? We need to continue steady-state engagement
working through a number of different venues like the National
Association of Secretaries of State has been a huge partner
amplifying our message. But it is also important to understand
that that the DHS service of the risk and vulnerability
assessment is just one of several options that States have
available.
We have approached some States. They have said thank you
for the offer but we have a private-sector solution that does
exactly that, that is already on contract, so I don't ever
frankly anticipate getting all 50 States in the risk and
vulnerability assessment process. I suspect we maybe get the 25
maybe 30 that is kind-of a stretch. It is, for us, again, it is
reaching out, continuing the engagement, continuing the
education and really frankly more than anything, it is building
a relationship and building and establishing trust.
We are still getting, you know, I think for the most part
we have gotten over kind-of the trust hump that we--the
challenge that we had last year, I think we are getting there.
So in terms of Florida, or frankly any State that was to
ask for a risk and vulnerability assessment, we have been very
clear in how we have communicated to our State partners that as
soon as you are ready to do a risk and vulnerability
assessment, we will be there.
There were discussions last time, I think I testified about
a 9-month backlog. There's no 9-month backlog, it is when the
State is available to do it and it is not just show up tomorrow
and we will do a vulnerability assessment. There is a little
bit of preparation that has to happen. I am sure Secretary
Gorbea can share her experience, but there is preparation that
has to happen before we can go in there and do our penetration
testing. There are legal agreements that have to be signed.
There's scoping of the networks that we have to do. So there
are a number of preparatory measures that do lead to some time
buffer before we can actually get in there.
Mrs. Demings. Thank you. Secretary Gorbea.
Ms. Gorbea. No, I have to say, you know, on the ground, we
have found DHS to be actually very responsive. In fact, one of
the first things that they--we were probably one of the first
to sign up for the--under the critical infrastructure set-up.
Then, the next thing I remember, we had, you know, three
people showed up in my office and the regional director, a
program person, a security person all introduced themselves, in
person. Which I have to say is, probably, on the first times I
have seen anybody from the Federal Government, you know, sort-
of, show up in my office and introduced themselves to my staff.
So, that created a bond in terms of a trust factor because
I know who I am dealing with and that started our process going
and we did do the risk and vulnerability assessment. What I
think, then, what was interesting is to see the disconnect,
sort-of, in a broader basis as information at the very, sort-
of, in the Classified and intelligence level, sort-of, started
to happen.
There were some misfires in terms of, you know, they would
contact the locality, but not the chief State election
official. If you are a chief State election official and you
are also an elected, you want to know what is going on in your
State, of course. That was, I think, really just this is all
new territory for all of us.
We are learning cyber stuff, they are learning election
stuff and I think one of the really big questions, as this
evolves, is that balance between, you know, the security world
deals with securing everything down. They don't want to tell,
you know, they want to tell as few people as possible.
We deal in the world of open government and transparency.
We need to be transparent. Going back to the point that was
made earlier, people can--need to be able to trust their
elections and so they do that because we are open and
transparent in the way we do things.
That is, I think, at the intersection of where the
challenge is. How do we secure the elections while not losing
the democracy and the secrecy of it all? Because I can't tell
you what is happening, but just trust me. Well, no, that is not
going to work in the elections frame.
Mrs. Demings. Thank you, so much. Mr. Chairman, I yield
back.
Chairman McCaul. The gentlelady yields. The gentlelady from
Arizona, Ms. McSally, is recognized.
Ms. McSally. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for your
testimony today. Look, we know bad actors like Russia have been
trying to undermine our way of life, our representative
government. Since the days that I was at the Air Force Academy
in the mid-1980's, we have been studying their tactics and they
evolve over time, but it is still the same intent.
I really appreciate the discussion today. I think it is
really important. I want to talk about the cybersecurity side
of this, not the misinformation side and one of those States
that was hacked was Arizona, I represent southern Arizona. We
have had a Classified briefing on this, but as you talked
about, you want to be in the unclassified realm as much as
possible.
There are all sorts of media reports out there, but what
can you talk about, Under Secretary Krebs, in this open forum,
about what happened in Arizona? I know you weren't there, but
what your organization knows about what happened in Arizona,
when, how it was detected, who was informed, what was learned
from it and, you know, the lessons learned going forward? I
just think it--there is a lot of confusion in the media and it
will be helpful to clear that up.
Under Secretary Krebs. So, thank you for the question and I
will go ahead and offer off at the beginning that we come in
and provide a bit more of a detailed conversation for you. In
fact, for Arizona, it is one of the more challenging situations
because it wasn't, necessarily, related directly to Russian
activity.
There--secretaries of state, election officials, by their
very nature are natural risk managers. They deal with
hurricanes, power outages, civil unrest, and criminals that
want to get access to personally identifiable information that
may reside within voter registration databases. So, every
attack, particularly those that we--or incident that we have
seen over the last couple of months, even, it is not always
Russia.
That is one of the unfortunate aspects of the climate,
right now, is that every time you see some sort of disruption,
whether it is intentional, malicious, accidental, everyone is
jumping to the conclusion of it is Russia. There are things
that happen on a daily basis in elections that just happen, so.
Ms. McSally. So, in Arizona can--can you just be clearer? I
mean, and by the way, and Russia, criminal elements are often
acting on behalf of the States.
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes ma'am.
Ms. McSally. So, let's not be fooled----
Under Secretary Krebs. But we do have criminals here in the
United States as well. So, at this point, given the kind of
confidential nature of some of these conversations, I can't get
too much into the Arizona piece. But again, I would like to
follow up with your office on that and see----
Ms. McSally. Yes.
Secretary Krebs [continuing]. And provide you a little bit
more information.
Ms. McSally. I would like to let, again, the key of
openness and transparency, so people understand. It can help
build their faith in the system that nothing was manipulated,
but what has been learned from it and what are we doing going
forward?
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, ma'am.
Ms. McSally. Again, we understand that in all the hacks
that did happen, nothing was manipulated. But it doesn't mean
it couldn't have been manipulated. Just because it hasn't
happened, yet, in 2018 doesn't mean it can't happen between now
and Election Day. If they choose to, right? Threat equals
capability plus intent.
Even though someone can cast a provisional ballot if a zip
code was turned around and jumbled up or their street address,
if we don't know that that happened then the provisional ballot
will be thrown out. Or if their voter file was deleted, they
will cast a provisional ballot, it will be compared, and they
say it is not a voter and it will be thrown out.
So, just the, you know, I have a concern about the
detection and the swift capability, moving forward, for this
election and beyond because on Election Day, if the lines are
getting longer and people are hearing something's not right.
That, in and of itself, meets the intent of the enemy, right?
That they are sowing confusion and discord, so can you just
talk little bit about that? Because, again, just because they
haven't done it yet doesn't mean they can't do it tomorrow.
Under Secretary Krebs. That is 100 percent right. That is
why we are not, necessarily, looking back at specifics. We are
looking back at the specifics of 2016, but given our broader
understanding of the I.T. environments that support elections,
we are looking at, more broadly, where the vulnerabilities are,
just in the system in general and what are the things we can do
to address those vulnerabilities, broadly?
It is not just Arizona. It is obviously all 50 States. So,
the thing that I reiterate is we are seeing, as I have traveled
across the country through primary season, I am continually
impressed by the level of seriousness that secretaries of state
and State election directors are paying to this issue. They
want more information. They want more threat information. They
want more information about how they can understand and manage
their risk.
Ms. McSally. Great, thanks. Look, we manage all those at
the county level. We do have our secretary of state role as
well. We are from Arizona. We are, generally, skeptical of the
Federal Government being involved in anything.
We are, you know, we are very independent-minded. So, is--
how is your relationship, you know, with the State there and--
and the understanding of the role that you have while still
allowing this to be localized and distributed which is where is
belongs?
Under Secretary Krebs. So, we do have a relationship with
Arizona. We are engaging on a regular basis, I think, as I
mentioned they are a member of the Election Infrastructure
ISAC. Every State is different. Every architect of a system is
different. The threat model is going to be different. Arizona
is different than Rhode Island, so.
Ms. McSally. I look forward to following up with you. My
time is----
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, ma'am.
Ms. McSally. Expired, but, specifically, thanks a lot,
appreciate it. I yield back.
Chairman McCaul. The gentlelady yields the gentlelady from
New York, Miss Rice, is recognized.
Miss Rice. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Krebs, last week
the Senate Intelligence Committee issued a bipartisan report
that concurred with the intelligence community's January 2017
assessment that the Russian government interfered in the 2016
election to support the Trump campaign. Do you agree with the
Senate Intelligence Committee and the intelligence community's
assessment?
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, ma'am.
Miss Rice. Have you shared your opinion with the President?
Under Secretary Krebs. I have not had the opportunity to
meet with the President, directly, about this issue. I have
been in briefings with the President on this issue, but I have
not directly engaged him on--on that.
Miss Rice. Do you think that this is an important enough
issue to engage him on this issue? Since he has repeatedly
refused to accept the conclusion of his own intelligence
community?
Mr. Kreb. Ma'am, residing within a technical agency where I
do at the under secretary level, I am not often afforded the
opportunity to meet with the President. I don't say this
jokingly, it is that I, you know, engage on a daily basis
with----
Miss Rice. Have you spoken to the Secretary and suggested
to her that she speak directly to the President----
Mr. Kreb. Yes, ma'am. We--I meet with the Secretary
regularly on this issue, and she has directly briefed the
President on this issue.
Miss Rice. The Justice Department and Special Counsel
Robert Mueller charged 13 Russian nationals and 3 Russian
companies in February with various crimes related to
interfering in the 2016 election, including stealing the
identities of American citizens. Do you believe that Special
Council Mueller's investigation is a witch hunt?
Secretary Kreb. Ma'am, can you repeat the question? I am
trying to understand.
Miss Rice. Yes, I will. The Justice Department and Special
Counsel Robert Mueller charged 13 Russian nationals and 3
Russian companies in February with various crimes related to
interfering in the 2016 election, which is what we have been
talking about here, including stealing the identities of
American citizens.
Do you believe that Special Counsel Mueller's investigation
is a witch hunt? Yes or no.
Secretary Kreb. I certainly don't think that charging the
Internet Research Agency and those that supported interfering
with the election a witch hunt, no, ma'am.
Miss Rice. So that is a no, you do not believe it is a
witch hunt.
Secretary Kreb. The 13 indictments you just indicated, I do
not believe that those are witch hunts. I think those are
legitimate.
Miss Rice. Mueller's investigation into at least that
portion of it, you are saying is----
Secretary Kreb. Yes, ma'am. I am not aware of the rest of
the investigation.
Miss Rice. Do you think the overall investigation is a
witch hunt?
Secretary Kreb. Ma'am, I am not aware of the scope and
extent of the investigation again, I engage every day with
State and local election officials on securing their systems,
I--you know, I read what I can in the paper, I am not privy to
Special Council Mueller's investigation and the scope of it.
Miss Rice. Well, in your position, you should know than
more than you are at least attributing yourself knowledge of.
Will President Trump be discussing Russian interference in the
2016 election in his meeting with President Vladimir Putin next
week?
Secretary Kreb. Based on the press reports that I have
seen, yes, ma'am, that is part of the agenda.
Miss Rice. Well I would assume that before that meeting,
the President is going to sit down with his top people, one of
whom is your boss, Secretary Nielsen. Will you recommend to
Secretary Nielsen since you don't get direct face time I guess
to talk to the President, will you be recommending to her that
she recommend to the President that he discussed Russian
interference in U.S. elections with President Putin?
Secretary Kreb. Again, based on press reports, that will be
part of the conversation. Of course I would suggest if I had
that conversation with the Secretary----
Miss Rice. Do you think you should have that conversation
with her?
Secretary Kreb. Again, I speak to the Secretary about this
matter on almost a daily basis and we have encouraged it.
Miss Rice. Have you specifically about this issue that I am
asking you about, whether she is going to recommend as one of
his advisors that he should bring this up in a serious manner
with President Putin?
Secretary Kreb. I would recommend that, yes, ma'am.
Miss Rice. OK, so just a clarification, why DHS countering
foreign influence task force, how it is different from the FBI
foreign influence task force, we can debate that all day long.
But why is there not just one comprehensive task force on
this critical issue?
Secretary Kreb. So I think the challenge here is that from
a information operations perspective of what Russia has
launched over the last couple years, the Government is not
necessarily directly organized from a--there's no single set of
jurisdictions, frankly; these issues like the FBI's law
enforcement authorities, my authorities to meet with private-
sector companies and build awareness and resilience within the
system.
We are working toward something like you are suggesting,
whether it is a single task force, but we do coordinate on a
regular basis. I meet at the under secretary level on an almost
weekly basis with my counterparts and a number of different
agencies, there are meetings in the National Security Council,
and there's staff technical level meetings between DHS, the
FBI, the Global Engagement Center.
Miss Rice. Thank you, I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman McCaul. Gentlelady yields, the--let us see,
gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Bacon.
Mr. Bacon. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you both
for being here today. I just want to ask Under Secretary Krebs
a--question for clarity. I think you have been touching on it a
little bit, I just want to make sure we have it right.
Is there anything else you need from Congress, whether it
is resources, the--you know, a budget, the appropriations and
so forth, is there anything else you need from us to safeguard
our elections systems from hacking or manipulation?
Under Secretary Krebs. So I think from a--thank you for the
question. I think from a pure authorities perspective, I think
we have everything we need to support State and local
governments in their election.
I think with more, from a resourcing perspective, I could
always do more. But we are learning from our past engagements,
whether it is risk and vulnerability assessments or some of the
other capabilities that we are providing.
The $26.2 million we were providing in the omnibus--the
fiscal year 2018 omnibus, certainly helped increase our
bandwidth, not just for election systems, but also in those
other infrastructure sectors that Congressman Langevin
mentioned.
So we are always looking at how to be more efficient in the
things we do and make sure that we are operating off of
requirements. The last thing I would add on that front is given
the nature of a public-private partnership, everything has to
be based on the demand signal as we are calling it.
The relationship, frankly, between State officials has only
really been at what I would say a healthy level for not even a
year now, maybe about a year now. It is still--we are still
defining what the requirement sets are, and that is going to be
something over the next 6 months, particularly in kind-of the
hot wash after 2018, we will get back to--we will pause,
reflect, do a hot wash, figure out where we need to go going
forward.
Mr. Bacon. One of the problems we hear is that our State
and local officials don't have the right clearances to work
with some of these things. Are we getting that problem solved?
Are we making progress?
Under Secretary Krebs. We are, we have taken a pretty hard
look at the clearance process. I think at this point we have
got about 37 States that have a senior election official with a
clearance, 9 more are in the processing, a handful have
declined for whatever reason, and they may have other officials
in the State that have access to the information.
Others are still in the decision-making process. Very--it
is a limited number. But I will also kind-of pull back on the
clearance piece a little bit. As I mentioned earlier, we are
doing everything possible we can to take things or to operate
in the unclassified space.
I would also suggest that the Classified information piece
and the clearance issue is not necessarily the driving factor
for our engagements. In a year-and-a-half ago or in 2016,
having never met Secretary Gorbea, if I would called her up and
said you need to take care of this system right now, she would
have said I don't know who you are, I am not going to do that.
I have no reason to trust you. Now, if I called her up and said
hey, look, we are seeing something, you need to take care of
this problem, based on the trust and the relationship we have
developed, even without a clearance I have fairly good
confidence that Secretary Gorbea would at least give me a flier
and then we would follow up afterwards.
Mr. Bacon. One last question here, we are seeing more and
more attacks from Russia against Ukraine's critical
infrastructure, and it seems to me they are using it as a test
to practice their techniques and capabilities.
First of all would you agree with that and second, what are
we learning from watching what Russia is doing with Ukraine?
Because clearly those same capabilities they are using--they
are studying us to the same if they need to.
Under Secretary Krebs. I think that is a fair assessment
that Ukraine is perhaps a pilot or a test bed. In terms of what
we are learning, they are getting better. You know each
subsequent incident shows that increased level of capability.
So what we are doing is sitting back and looking at, OK, what
is the capability that they have demonstrated and what are the
corresponding vulnerabilities or exposure or risk level here in
the United States and then how do we work with our critical
infrastructure community to help them understand that risk and
do the things they need to do and how can we help them
understand that risk and do the things they need to do and how
can we help them do that?
One of the things that I think I--we need to move beyond
information sharing. Information sharing is the foundation of
how you manage risk. We need to do and continue move into is a
risk management integration space. This is the importance of
avoiding the silos because increasingly these systems, whether
it is industrial control systems, or just general I.T. systems,
are almost agnostic to sectors, or at least they cut across
several sectors.
So we need to be working cross-sector government industry
together to do integrated risk assessments, integrated
strategic planning, and integrated risk mitigation strategy. So
there is a lot more ahead of us and this is one things were
really focusing on right now at NPPD.
Mr. Bacon. Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields back. The gentleman
from California, Mr. Correa, is recognized.
Mr. Correa. Thank you Mr. Chairman. First of all Honorable
Krebs, Honorable Gorbea, I want to thank you for being here
today and I also want to thank you for the good job you are
doing. I know sometimes it goes unappreciated, but we are
relying on you, OK?
I wanted to follow up, on it on this committee we talk
about best practices when it comes to cybersecurity, financial
institutions, I would presume that right now cross the 50
States, we have some kind of semblance of coordination were
those best practices are being applied at every one of those 50
States when it comes to the elections?
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes sir through the Election
Infrastructure Information Sharing and Analysis Center.
Basically, to kind-of unpack what that means is it is a group
of all 50 States including other election officials that are
connected in a manner that if one has a best practice or an
observation they want to share then all 50 are all----
Mr. Correa. What about in a situation where we have had
recently that you have a cyber attack on financial institutions
within nano seconds everybody is on top of it so that people
figure out that there's actually an attack going on and people
can respond to it.
Under Secretary Krebs. Let me actually give you a practical
example from the election community.
Mr. Correa. Yes, sir.
Under Secretary Krebs. A few months ago, there was a
phishing attack not necessarily attributed to a nation-state,
but a phishing attack on the State election system. What
happened is that State detected the phishing attack, worked
with DHS, and then we were able to share indicators across the
EI-ISAC. Now, did this happen in a matter of seconds or even
minutes, no. But what we gain through this approach of
community or collective defense is broader community----
Mr. Correa. Will you be able to get to get there
eventually? I know there are a lot of issues, costs, software,
hardware, will you be able to get to that level when you have
an attack you are able to respond almost immediately?
Under Secretary Krebs. I think ultimately that is our
aspiration of course.
Mr. Correa. I ask that question following up Ms. McSally's
point which is trust. I am from the State of California. We are
like Arizona, we mistrust the Federal Government, but we try to
work with the Federal Government. Yet, really in these
elections, the issue is trust. If you wake up Wednesday morning
and somebody fried your software system and there are questions
of the validity of those election results, we are going to have
major challenges to our democracy in this country.
You know I am trying to--in my mind trying to figure out
what can we do to help you to make sure that that is not a
reality one of these Wednesday mornings?
Ms. Gorbea. Sir if I may----
Mr. Correa. Yes.
Ms. Gorbea. From the State level, so I think it is this
risk mitigation right. We can't just rely on we are going to
put a wall around our systems and that is to protect us from
everything.
Mr. Correa. That comes back to the issue of ultimately you
come back to paper ballots as being----
Ms. Gorbea. Paper ballots are absolutely critical in my
opinion. People ask me all the time, do you think on-line
voting should happen? I am like no not really because I for
one, even though despite----
Mr. Correa. Most of the folks I know that show up to
California to vote actually vote electronically.
Ms. Gorbea. So I know that California is a very large State
with many different systems----
Mr. Correa. Yes, yes.
Ms. Gorbea. I know that Secretary Padilla has been doing a
fantastic job.
Mr. Correa. I will let him know you said that.
Ms. Gorbea. But going back to--we talked about provisional
ballots for example, right. So say something happens and you
show up and your name is not on the voter registry, that is as
important in my mind to look at what is our provisional
balloting system as it is what the machines are, because the
machines are, in a sense, easy. You can come in, you can buy
them, you put them, you install them, but then what if they
don't work? What if somebody sabotages them? What is that next
step? We have very different provisional ballot systems in this
country. In Rhode Island that is a very simple process----
Mr. Correa. Do you think that is a formula for major chaos
one of these Wednesday mornings that everybody has their own
different way of doing it? This is State of Florida, hanging
chads all over again.
Ms. Gorbea. I think it is worth examining it. I understand
that given--that while----
Mr. Correa. I only have 40 seconds left. I just want to be
quick here but I would like to talk to you a little bit more on
this. I used to chair elections when I was in the State senate
in California so we dealt with these issues a little bit. Not
to the extent we are dealing with them now but my final
question and this is one for you maybe to answer or not to
answer for us here. At what point does a foreign nation's
interference in our electoral system constitute a declaration
of war in our country?
Under Secretary Krebs. I think that is the right policy
question we need to have right now. I don't have an answer for
you.
Ms. Gorbea. I agree. I think that is one of the critical
questions we need to ask.
Mr. Correa. Thank you very much. Mr. Chair, I yield.
Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields, and I appreciate
that question. We have been trying to define that for quite
some time. Was it an act of cyber warfare? I appreciate you
raising that.
The gentleman from New York, Mr. Donovan.
Mr. Donovan. I am your last questioner.
Chairman McCaul. At least on this side.
Mr. Donovan. Yes. The title of the hearing was ``DHS's
Progress in Securing Election Systems and Other Critical
Infrastructure.'' I would just like to ask about the other
critical infrastructure for a moment, since you are both here.
Secretary Gorbea, you said before in your opening statement
about balancing our needs for secrecy with our need for
transparency, a very difficult thing to do.
Mr. Krebs, during, you know some of the other attacks that
we have seen on our health care systems, our dams, our oil and
natural gas systems, the cyber attacks on our energy
industries, how do we balance that need for secrecy and
transparency and how do we as a Government share
vulnerabilities with private industry? We all have this same
common goal here is to protect our energy system, our
electrical grids.
But then, again, there is a difficulty, I suspect, with
industry, particularly those who have competitors, of revealing
that they are vulnerable. They don't want to lose the
confidence of their clients or their users.
So how do we balance that stuff? I know it is not an easy
question and there's not an easy answer for that, but since I
am the last one on this side of the aisle, I will throw you a
hardball.
Under Secretary Krebs. That is a----
Mr. Donovan. Thanks.
[Laughter.]
Under Secretary Krebs. That is a great question. The way I
kind-of break this up, right now, at least, is to look at
opportunistic attacks and then more strategic adversary
attacks. So when you think about what happened last summer or
last fall with WannaCry, the United States was generally not
terribly affected, unlike some of our European counterparts,
and look at what happened in Russia and elsewhere.
The reason for that was, in part, because we did a fairly
good job, I think, in a Government-industry partnership, of
sharing information, indicators, working with the security
research community to see what they saw. Then there were some
security researchers that took certain activities to help out.
But it started before WannaCry even launched, in that we had
raised the level of awareness, we would worked with, whether it
was the Government doing it, or just in general, the level of
awareness, people had done the right cyber hygiene basics to
protect their systems.
They had patched their operating systems, they had patched
their software, so that the majority of the vulnerabilities had
been closed down. So from an opportunistic perspective, I think
we are--we are certainly making progress; we are improving.
Now, this is always a question of resourcing; I have said
that before today. When we think about the recent rash of
ransomware attacks, those are similarly opportunistic attacks--
Colorado, Atlanta, Baltimore, Mecklenburg County, Charlotte--
those were all attacks that had been, you know, they were
scanned, their systems were scanned, they found
vulnerabilities, they went in, locked them up and said, ``I
want $50,000.''
That is an example of not necessarily doing the basics. So
we are really stressing to prevent opportunistic attacks, which
is, generally speaking, about 85 percent of, these are, you
know, soft numbers, not empirically based but good enough to go
by for the purposes of this discussion of, you do the basics
right, and you can drive most of the bad actors out of the
space, the general hackers.
Now, from a strategic perspective, we do know, as I talked
with Congressman Bacon earlier, we do know that the adversary's
getting better, particularly in our hard infrastructure space.
We saw them last summer, we released a report earlier this
year, along with the FBI, on Russian activity in
infrastructure. We saw them in energy, critical manufacturing,
transportation, aviation.
We are currently seeing them, presently, in the information
technology side, the I.T. side. Now, the problem is, once they
get more comfortable operating in the operational technology
side. So that is where we are focusing right now.
I mentioned earlier, we talked about siloing, we talked
about this shift from information sharing to risk management.
That is where we are driving a great deal of our effort right
now. It is taking a piece of threat intelligence, like, I know
the amount of intelligence I see on a daily basis, it is
overwhelming, but what--I need to do a better job of working
with industry and saying, this piece of intelligence, so what?
What does it mean? What does it mean to that system, this
system, to the Nation, to a region?
Figuring that piece out and then asking the question, what
are we going to do about it? That is principally where we are
focused, and we are kicking off a new initiative within NPPD,
the National Risk Management Initiative, that is really going
to focus in on moving beyond intelligence and into risk
management. Of understanding what the problem is, how to
address it and doing it in a cross-sector Government-industry
partnership manner. I think that is where we are going to make
the most significant gain.
Mr. Donovan. You are right. I thank you both for your
service.
I yield, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields.
The gentlelady from California, Ms. Barragan, is
recognized.
Ms. Barragan. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you both
for being here today.
Secretary Krebs, I wanted to ask, last month, I believe,
the Senate Intelligence Committee had put out a report called,
``Russia Targeting of Election Infrastructure During the 2016
Election.'' I assume you have seen that?
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, ma'am.
Ms. Barragan. In that report, there was a paragraph, a
sentence that said, ``although the DHS provided warning to I.T.
staff in the fall of 2016, notifications to State election
officials were delayed by nearly a year.'' That is pretty
startling to read, and I think I hear from local elected
officials, that is concerning that the Federal Government knew
of something yet they didn't get notice of it. I think I read
about North Carolina having problems on election day, and them
having no idea about the possible breaches and concerns that
were happening. What are you doing to make sure that doesn't
happen again?
Under Secretary Krebs. So on the top end, we have
established a series of information-sharing protocols, working
with the Government Coordinating Counsel to say, hey, when we
get something or we see something, these are the five officials
in each State and the system owner that we would notify.
Secretary Gorbea mentioned it earlier, you know, a year ago
or even before that, they were trying to figure out the
cybersecurity side of it; DHS was trying to figure out the
election side of it. We are past that, we really committed to
working together, we have built partnerships, we have
established trust and we are really getting to that point of
understanding what they need from us and we are reacting
accordingly. So I have great confidence that if we did see
something, that I would know exactly who to go to in each State
to share that information.
We will not be in a position like we were in 2016, when,
frankly, we were in kind of uncharted territory, for us at the
time, at least.
Ms. Barragan. So are you suggesting that the then-under
secretary didn't know who to call at these--in these States, to
let them know----
Under Secretary Krebs. There was no election infrastructure
subsector. So these relationships were not established at the
time. So my predecessor, who I have spoken with about this,
they--what they did was follow a traditional incident response
protocol. They notified the State or the asset owner, which may
have been a county or may have been a private-sector owner-
operator, and that is the playbook.
Going through the process now, we understand that this is a
unique community, this is a unique subsector, and what works in
other sectors doesn't work here, and we have changed our
protocols accordingly.
Ms. Barragan. Is DHS in a position to detect if there is
such meddling happening in all of the 50 States? In other
words, does DHS have any visibility into whether relevant State
systems are being targeted?
Under Secretary Krebs. So since, frankly, February of this
year, we have quadrupled our insight into State activities. We
have an intrusion detection system that is called Albert, it is
similar to a system the Federal Government uses, that we have
deployed out. Now, I mentioned 21 States earlier, in part,
those 21 States, we saw that activity because of the deployed
Albert sensors at the time.
Like I mentioned, we have quadrupled our insights since
just February of this year. By the mid-terms of--by November of
this year, we will have almost every State covered down on and
we have significant coverage across counties in other
jurisdictions.
Ms. Barragan. OK. My understanding is that there is no
Nationally-mandated security requirements for election
technology vendors nor are they subject to a consistent set of
breach notification laws. How would you characterize DHS's
relationship with election-related vendors?
Under Secretary Krebs. So, we--there are actually a
complementary group called the Sector Coordinating Council. So,
on the Government Coordinating Council you have State and local
election officials and then on the Sector Coordinating Council
side, we have vendors will all the major technology providers
to elections.
Frankly, we took up, kind-of, an incremental approach. We
started building strong relationships with the State partners
and local partners and we are moving--we have the Sector
Coordinating Council established and the relationships are
growing. They are not, frankly, probably where they need to be,
but they are getting there.
Ms. Barragan. My last question to you sir, is, we know that
the President doesn't believe in the meddling and you have
already indicated you believe the intelligence reports. What
does it do to morale, to the people under you to know that
their commander, the top guy, doesn't even believe that there
was any meddling when that is what you guys are doing? Your
mission is to go out and stop it from happening and preventing,
you know, them to interfere in our democracy. What does that do
to the people under you?
Under Secretary Krebs. I think generally speaking, the
morale on my team is really high right now. I think the ability
to work with folks with Secretary Gorbea--the way I see it, a
high functioning organization.
Ms. Barragan. So, you don't see an impact at all from the
President's speak about this to your team?
Under Secretary Krebs. I am just saying in general, the
morale of my team is very high.
Ms. Barragan. Great, thank you.
Chairman McCaul. The gentlelady yields. The gentleman from
Massachusetts, Mr. Keating, is recognized.
Mr. Keating. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to thank
you for being here. Just a question since I had a conflicting
hearing. But what is the attitude--range of attitude among
local and State officials when you are saying, we are here to
give you some help? Do some of them say, don't worry I have it
covered, I am confident our system is fine? Is that something
you hear?
Under Secretary Krebs. Every State is a different
experience.
Mr. Keating. No, but have you heard that? That is what I
asked.
Under Secretary Krebs. I have heard some States say, we are
resourced. I have been told rather that some States have said,
we have the resources and the capabilities----
Mr. Keating. Are you just waiting--have you reached out to
all the State and local officials?
Under Secretary Krebs. We have engaged every single State.
Mr. Keating. OK. So, you have heard back from those
officials or you?
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, sir.
Mr. Keating. So, some of them just feel confident, no
problem, got it covered?
Under Secretary Krebs. Every State is working with DHS in
some capacity.
Mr. Keating. Well, I know that. I just asked what your
experience was. I mean, it is not a tough question. It is
just--are you getting that feedback, don't worry, I am
confident, I have got it covered, from those officials?
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, sir. I think some States feel
that they have--they are adequately resources or adequately
supported. Others, like insurance policies, and even though
they may have things covered, they will still take some of
our----
Mr. Keating. Do you think that we are going to be attacked
in 4 months by Russia?
Under Secretary Krebs. Sir, I don't have any information or
evidence to suggest they are going to attack us, but we don't
need that.
Mr. Keating. Do you share information with our intelligence
officials, then?
Under Secretary Krebs. They share with me, yes, sir. I am
not a collector.
Mr. Keating. They believe we are going to be attacked. So,
you don't believe--opinions.
Under Secretary Krebs. I don't think I have seen that
assessment that they are going to attack our election. That
the--Secretary Gorbea----
Mr. Keating. You haven't heard that from our intelligence
officials? U.S. intelligence official, you haven't heard that
one?
Under Secretary Krebs. I have--you know, maybe I need to go
back and review, but.
Mr. Keating. Yes, I think so. I think----
Under Secretary Krebs. Sir, I think what they have said is
that----
Mr. Keating. I think our intelligence officials are saying
they are going to do it again.
Under Secretary Krebs. I think that they have.
Mr. Keating. Meaning Russia.
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, sir. Russia, I think they--
Russia is engaging in information operations whether it is
focused on elections or not.
Mr. Keating. Well, our intelligence--maybe I am wrong? But
intelligence is saying----
Under Secretary Krebs. No, I am--sir, I am not suggesting.
Mr. Keating. They are going to do it again. You don't
believe they are going to do it again?
Under Secretary Krebs. I wouldn't put----
Mr. Keating. You don't agree with our intelligence
officials?
Under Secretary Krebs. I wouldn't put anything past the
Russians. I am not disagreeing with any intelligence. I am
just--what I am saying is.
Mr. Keating. I am just saying, don't you agree with our
intelligence--the people that are saying that?
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes sir, I agree----
Mr. Keating. Wow. That was----
Under Secretary Krebs. With our intelligence community.
Mr. Keating. Sorry about that, but. Are we sufficiently
ready for this attack? What kind of guarantee can you give us
that we are up to the task?
Under Secretary Krebs. I have confidence in the resilience
of the system. I have, I think, some of the controlling
measures that we have in place, whether it is provisional
ballots as we discussed or some of the other compensating
controls. We think, you know, is it 100 percent----
Mr. Keating. Can you guarantee?
Under Secretary Krebs. Of course not.
Mr. Keating. No. And it is likely that there could be some
difficulty. It is in the realm of possibility, correct?
Under Secretary Krebs. Sir, I, you now, I am paid to be
paranoid. I plan for bad days and that is what we are working
toward.
Mr. Keating. Yes. Well, have you reached out, as a rule,
and communicated the fact that it is likely we are going to be
attacked now that you know that, and will--in fact, will be
attacked? No. 2, that despite the great efforts of mitigating
this that can't cover that, have you reached out to all of our
officials and said, we believe, strongly, you should move to
paper ballots?
Under Secretary Krebs. It is a baseline recommendation of
the Department, working with the GCC and others that--yes,
paper trails, verifiable, auditable paper trails are a best
practice, period.
Mr. Keating. Yes. Secretary Gorbea, what are you--what are
your colleagues, Nation-wide, what are you hearing back? I
mean, to me this is a strong statement that you come from.
Despite our efforts, you know, our best efforts to try and
mitigate this, that there should be paper ballots? That is what
we should be doing, frankly.
Ms. Gorbea. I wholeheartedly agree and I give a lot of
credit to Congressman Langevin for when he was the Secretary of
State. He started us on this paper ballot process with optical
scan readers and when I came into office those--that equipment
was outdated and we replaced it with similar because there
should always be something that you can touch and feel that you
and I can look at and say, this is how the voter wanted to----
Mr. Keating. Particularly provisional ballot because if
they do get in the infrastructure and they can manipulate data,
those provisional ballots are going to be critical.
Ms. Gorbea. That is right. But that is where looking at the
various systems and rules around provisional ballots are really
important because in Rhode Island, those provision ballots are
reviewed by election officials----
Mr. Keating. Is our government, the U.S. Government, the
Federal Government, communicated to all election officials
sufficiently, in your opinion, that there will be an attack
that their efforts to mitigate it, but no guarantees there that
they can be successful; you should move to paper ballots. Has
it been that strong a message or is just the recommendation?
Ms. Gorbea. I think we are all in this space, very
concerned about making sure that we mitigate the risk. We don't
need, necessarily, the Federal Government to tell us this
because we see it everywhere. So, I think all States are taking
measures.
Mr. Keating. How many States are moving to paper ballots?
It is 4 months away.
Ms. Gorbea. I don't have the answer to that, but the
National Association of Secretaries of State might be able to
provide that.
Mr. Keating. Do you know, Under Secretary Krebs?
Under Secretary Krebs. Sir, I know that 5 States, right
now, are exclusively on non-paper ballot systems. Of those 5, 4
are in the RFP process. One is, you know, waiting for money,
frankly.
Mr. Keating. So, it is pretty prevalent that there is going
to be paper ballots? That is reassuring.
KREBS: It--so, I think on the balance there are paper
ballots, but there are still systems out there that do not have
paper ballots.
Mr. Keating. Percentage-wise, again?
Under Secretary Krebs. Off the top of my head, I don't have
percentages.
Mr. Keating. I would suggest that is something we should
know. That would be----
Under Secretary Krebs. So, happy to.
Mr. Keating. That you could do that.
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, sir, happy to circle back
with--and work with the Election Assistance Commission----
Mr. Keating. That would be helpful.
Under Secretary Krebs. And the secretaries----
Mr. Keating. I realize your limitations. I appreciate your
testimony and your good work. As a last comment, dealing with
the Russians, our intelligence said they are doing it again. We
have to have deterrents, as well as a rope-a-dope approach,
where we are just doing our best to mitigate it, and I hope
that is done. I know it is not in your specific purview. It is
certainly not yours at the State level, but in the interim, I
think we should give the strongest message possible for paper
ballots. That will deter them in the actual infrastructure
apparatus attempts to get into our system. On a larger scale, I
believe very strongly that the sanctions and the deterrents
that we have at the upper levels are critical. So thank you for
your work. I yield back.
Chairman McCaul. The gentleman yields. The gentlelady from
Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, is recognized.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Let me thank the Chairman and Ranking
Member for holding this hearing, and to the witnesses, let me
thank you, as well. Committee business in judiciary proceeding
on issues that dealt with the 2016 election delayed me. But
this is an important hearing, and I want to follow the line of
reasoning of my colleague, Mr. Keating, and maybe in a
different perspective.
To both of you, let me thank you for the service that you
give. But I believe that this will be a Federal election in a
large way. The Congress will be up for reelection, the House in
totality, the Senate partially. So this is a Federal election,
and I have the greatest respect for State officers, and they
are our collaborators. But I would say to the Secretary that it
is the responsibility of the Federal Government to at least
provide the structure and the walls of security upon which you
can work within, or even add to by your own expertise.
With that in mind, I frankly believe that this Government
has not been effective in recognizing the larger picture, and
that is the enormous involvement and invasion that Russia
perpetrated in 2016, and in elections before that, where we
probably did not have all of the analysis. I do not believe
that we are solidly in control, and facing what is a potential
of invasion, interference, and altering and skewing of the
election by the Russians, and maybe some others. I don't
believe, in particular, that the commander-in-chief has been
particularly effective in acknowledging that invasion in 2016,
and I would hope in his meeting that I certainly have concern
with, with Vladimir Putin, that that will be No. 1 in his
agenda.
Secretary Krebs, do you know whether the President will be
discussing election fraud, election challenges, in his meeting
with the head of Russia?
Under Secretary Krebs. Yes, ma'am, that is my
understanding.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Have you given him or the Secretary of
Homeland Security--I don't know if she is there, but the State
Department, those are all diplomats. Have you given him a
matrix, a list of questions or information to the White House
that he will be well-informed in his questioning?
Under Secretary Krebs. Ma'am, I personally have not, and I
would need to get back to you on whether the Secretary----
Ms. Jackson Lee. But you think it would be important that
those questions be raised?
Under Secretary Krebs. I think that that is a useful
conversation, yes, ma'am, just a----
Ms. Jackson Lee. I hope more than useful. Let me----
Under Secretary Krebs. Stern warning, yes ma'am.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Earlier this year, I introduced H.R. 3202,
the Cyber Vulnerability Disclosure Reporting Act, which passed
the House earlier this year with the help of this committee and
the Chairman and Ranking Member. The bill requires the
Secretary of Homeland Security to submit a report on the
policies and procedures developed for coordinating cyber
availability disclosures. The report will include an annex with
information on instances in which cybersecurity vulnerability,
disclosure policies, and procedures were used to disclose
details on identified weaknesses in computing sciences or
digital services at risk. The report will provide information
on the degree to which the information provided by DHS was used
by industry and other stakeholders in a closed setting.
The reason I worked on this bill before the full House for
consideration is a problem often referred to as ``zero-day
events.'' Zero-day event describes the situation that network
security professionals may find themselves when a previously
unknown error or flaw in computing code is exploited by cyber
criminals, or terrorists, or someone who wants to undermine our
elections. That is the level that I think we may be at, at some
point in our election.
So, Mr. Secretary, I ask you, do you, in fact, have the
kind of infrastructure at DHS that can be prepared for
catastrophic events dealing with the Nation's democracy, these
elections? DHS employees stand on the front lines of Federal
Government efforts to defend our Nation's critical
infrastructure from natural disasters, terrorism, adversarial
threats, technological risks such as those caused by cyber
threats.
So my concern would be elections that I hope are classified
as critical infrastructure. Are you confident that you have a
team that, if the secretary from Rhode Island reaches out, even
with her good works, to the Federal Government, where are we in
protecting election, detecting Russian invasion and altering
our election system?
Mr. Krebs. So generally speaking, I think we have a team
that is elastic, in that we can focus on a number of different
infrastructure sectors, and when an acute need arises, we can
surge into a specific sector like election infrastructure. So
if I got that call from Secretary Gorbea, and she needed a fly-
in team of ``X'' number of people, we could deliver that.
With more, though, I can, of course, do more. So we are
taking a look at what the threat picture looks like, what our
ability to manage risk across the country is, and the demand
signal from our stakeholders. All of our engagements are
voluntary in this space, so I have to have a requirement set. I
have to have a demand signal. If Secretary Gorbea needs
something, and if I get 49 other secretaries that say they need
something, that compounds into a very clear demand----
Ms. Jackson Lee. So do we need to write legislation to give
you requirements of indicia that says, this is when you shoot
into a State that is impacted by what they think is a cyber
threat in their elections, and you need to dispatch. Are you
voluntarily sending staff there? Or do you have legislative
authority?
Under Secretary Krebs. I think it is a--I have legislative
authority to send folks on instant response capabilities. That
was already been provided.
Ms. Jackson Lee. And resources? And resources?
Under Secretary Krebs. So it depends on the level of the
incident. You know, we don't have 1,000 people sitting on a
bench waiting for a phone call. We have folks that are
providing incident response capabilities. They are providing
hunt capabilities, risk and vulnerability assessments. It is
based--like I said, elasticity is critical here, because folks
can do something on Monday, and they do something different on
Tuesday, and we will deal with surge.
Ms. Jackson Lee. Well, Mr. Secretary, it was humorous to
say 1,000 people on the bench. Some of us are very much into
sports, and we would like to have 1,000 so we could substitute
out those who are not working. But the point is it may be
1,000--you know, this is a big Nation, 300 million-plus, and it
may be 1,000 incidents in the middle of a high-profile
election.
I consider the Federal elections certainly are the highest
profile, although State elections, Governors, State legislators
and others certainly are part of the democratic infrastructure.
What I am saying is, with all seriousness, that I believe
that you should be prepared in this infrastructure scheme, and
there are many others. I could be talking about the electric
grid and others. I don't have the time to do so. But I want to
focus, because I don't believe that the administration--and you
are in there as part of it. I am not saying your direct
office--has given this the attention and the sensitivity and
seriousness that I, frankly, believe puts you in the seat,
along with the Secretary of Homeland Security to get those
1,000 people on the bench, and if they are needed from sea to
signing she--signing she--sea, that we are able to protect the
election of the voters of the American people. That is what I
am trying to hear from you.
Secretary Kreb. Yes, ma'am, I understand your concern.
I will tell you this much, and hopefully the experience is
validated by Secretary Gorbea, but I spend 40 to 50 percent of
my time right now, almost exclusively on elections. There is no
way I could take this any more seriously than I do and my team
sees that. We have capabilities across this organization that
are able to surge in to this space.
So when we think about mid-terms, when we think about
November--there are protective security advisors distributed
across this country, 130 or 140 of them. I have got
cybersecurity advisors distributed across this country, on any
given day they are working across the 16 sectors. In November
they will be focused on election infrastructure; that is just
that group. I have other folks in the District of Columbia that
will be focusing on elections, so we are able to surge in to
the space.
That said, I can always do more--with more I can always do
more. So we are continuing to work with our stakeholders to
understand what it is they need from us, and then that refines
our resource requirements.
Ms. Jackson Lee. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, I am yielding
back. I would ask the Secretary to think of an SOS number that
could be given out as we move toward elections. If I am out in
a field and somebody says I am totally collapsed and my local
people can't find out why they are collapsed or what is going
on, whether we should move to provisional, would be helpful to
have that one SOS number.
Secretary Kreb. Yes, ma'am.
Ms. Jackson Lee. With that, Mr. Secretary, will you take
that under advisement, be able to say yes?
Secretary Kreb. Yes, ma'am.
Ms. Jackson Lee. All right, thank you very much. I yield
back, thank you.
Chairman McCaul. Gentlelady yields, I am going to think--
Ranking Member, I mean, closing. I would like to thank our
witnesses for being here today, I just wanted to conclude with
a short personal experience.
Over 20 years ago, I was a Federal prosecutor, Justice, and
I prosecuted a guy named Johnny Chung who lead us to the
Director of Chinese Intelligence, who was acting on behalf of
China Aerospace because he liked then-President Clinton's
position on technology transfers. He put money in to Johnny
Chung's Hong Kong bank account to put in to the Presidential
election.
So my point is, is that this is nothing new, foreign
adversaries influencing our elections and Presidential
elections. I think it has been going on for quite some time. I
think now, they have found a new tool to use and manipulate to
do that, and that is the internet and cyber space.
So with that I want to thank both of you for your strong
leadership on this issue. We take this very seriously in the
Congress on both sides of the aisle as we enter into the mid-
term elections. If there's anything this committee can do to
help you in your efforts, please let us know.
Members may have additional questions they may submit in
writing, and pursuant to Committee rule VII(D) the hearing
record will stay open for 10 days.
Without objection, committee stands adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 12:38 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]

----------
Questions From Honorable John Katko for Christopher C. Krebs
Question 1. Obviously, cybersecurity is a hot topic that many
Government agencies have a piece of. But I think the one thing we
learned after 9/11 was the potential damage that can be done when
Government resources and intelligence are segmented and stove-piped.
Can you speak to the importance of clarifying the roles and
responsibilities of your directorate not only at the Department, but
across the Federal Government to your ability to move this Nation
toward more robust cybersecurity policies and practices?
Answer. The Department has been provided clear roles and
responsibilities authorized by several statutes passed in 2014 and
2015, and are codified primarily in Title II of the Homeland Security
Act (the Act); the Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015
(CISA); and subchapter II, chapter 35 of title 44, U.S. Code, as
created by the Federal Information Security Modernization Act of 2014
(FISMA). These functions are also supported by several important
Executive branch documents, including Presidential Policy Directives 21
and 41. These actions have furthered DHS's cybersecurity mission since
its inception and codified interagency roles and responsibilities.
Specifically, the Department placed the National Cybersecurity and
Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) within the DHS National
Protection and Programs Directorate to serve as the round-the-clock
operational center that executes the Department's cybersecurity and
communications mission. The NCCIC is a lead civilian interface for
sharing cyber threat information with the Government that is uniquely
positioned as a sharing hub to integrate information from multiple
sources, and use it to provide Government agencies and the private
sector with actionable information to recognize, prevent, and mitigate
harm from cyber attacks. As such, the NCCIC facilitates multi-
directional information sharing between the Federal Government and the
private sector.
It is critical that Congress pass the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Security Agency Act in order to reinforce NPPD's role as
currently performed. This law will establish a cybersecurity agency at
the Department of Homeland Security to further National efforts to
enhance the security and resilience of U.S. cyber and physical critical
infrastructure.
Question 2. Among the challenges that we face in cybersecurity is
the pace at which our adversaries adapt their tactics, techniques, and
procedures as we harden our own systems and networks. Are there any
particular methods of attack or vectors of intrusion that DHS is
focusing on during the upcoming election cycle?
Answer. Many of the methods of attack and vectors of intrusion that
DHS sees can be avoided through implementation of basic cyber hygiene
mitigation efforts. As a result of malicious actors exploiting
unpatched software, conducting phishing campaigns, and leveraging
common vulnerabilities to pursue attacks against critical
infrastructure organizations, we emphasize with the election community
the myriad of attack vectors in order to increase the defense and
resiliency of the election infrastructure.
Question 3. Is NPPD being given access to all the necessary access
to and information from the intelligence and law enforcement community
to ensure you are in a position to accurately measure the risks to our
election system? Can you say the same thing for the other sectors that
have been designated critical infrastructure?
Answer. To most effectively share information with all of our
partners--not just those with security clearances--DHS works with the
intelligence community to declassify relevant intelligence or provide
tearlines as much as possible. While DHS prioritizes declassifying
information to the extent possible, DHS also provides Classified
information to cleared stakeholders, as appropriate.
Although more work is needed, DHS's goal is to ensure that law
enforcement and the intelligence community are sharing all relevant
information and that it is in a format that can be widely disseminated
to critical infrastructure partners. This work is a vital part of our
information-sharing efforts.
Questions From Honorable John Ratcliffe for Christopher C. Krebs
Question 1. The Election System is just one part of the critical
infrastructure security responsibilities that DHS has. Is there a need
for each of these sectors to create their own cybersecurity information
centers like the NCCIC or would such a splintering of Federal resources
potentially harm the security of Nation?
Answer. To break down information stovepipes and ensure cross-
sector approaches to protecting our Nation, the Department's specific
cybersecurity authorities executed through NPPD--including authorities
related to sharing, analyzing, and coordinating actionable information
related to cybersecurity risks and incidents; protecting Federal
information systems; and responding to cybersecurity incidents--enable
NPPD to engage with Federal and non-Federal entities (i.e. all
stakeholders--public, private, and international) and across and beyond
all critical infrastructure sectors to collaboratively improve
cybersecurity practices and protect Federal and non-Federal entities
from cyber risks. While Sector-Specific Agencies have specific roles
with respect to working with their stakeholders, DHS has the lead for
understanding and providing cross-sector information, analysis, and
protective measures to all sectors. If agencies work within stovepipes
with their stakeholders, then other sectors are not afforded the
critical information related to new attack vectors and identified
vulnerabilities. Congress has taken specific action to overcome this
challenge and clarify DHS's role to prevent stovepipes across critical
infrastructure sectors. The Homeland Security Act was amended in 2014
and 2015 to codify the role of the Department's National Cybersecurity
and Communications Integration Center (NCCIC) as the Federal-civilian
interface for sharing information regarding cybersecurity risks and
incidents and authorize the NCCIC to provide cybersecurity-related
technical assistance, risk management support, and incident response
capabilities to Federal and non-Federal entities. In a similar fashion,
the Cybersecurity Act of 2015 also establishes the NCCIC as the Federal
Government's central hub for sharing cyber threat indicators between
the private sector and the Federal Government and requires the
Department to establish the Federal Government's capability and process
for sharing cyber threat indicators with both Federal and non-Federal
entities. DHS operates a central hub for information exchange,
technical expertise, operational partnerships, and systems-focused
cybersecurity capabilities through the National Cybersecurity and
Communications Integration Center.
Cross-sector coordination of the Federal Government's cybersecurity
efforts is critical to our Nation's National security, economic
security, public health, and safety. Information regarding situational
awareness, vulnerability, and incidents must be shared as quickly as
our adversaries move in cyber space.
Question 2. Can you speak to the importance of clarifying the roles
and responsibilities of your directorate, not only at the Department,
but across the Federal Government, for your ability to move this Nation
towards more robust cybersecurity policies and practices?
Answer. Response was not received at the time of publication.
Questions From Honorable James R. Langevin for Christopher C. Krebs
Question 1a. On April 24, Assistant Secretary Jeanette Manfra
testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs
Committee that the surge in risk and vulnerability assessments for
elections infrastructure created ``a significant backlog in other
critical infrastructure sectors and Federal agencies'' waiting for
similar assessments. The President's 2019 budget did not request an
increase in resources sufficient to overcome this backlog.
Are more resources necessary to support the increased requests from
State and local governments without delaying other assessments?
Question 1b. What is the current RVA backlog? What is the prognosis
for that backlog over the next calendar year?
Answer. Currently, about 28 critical infrastructure entities and
Federal agencies have Risk and Vulnerability Assessments (RVAs) that
have been scheduled at a later date due to the critical, time-sensitive
prioritization of election-related RVAs. For the RVAs unrelated to
elections, the wait time is at least 100 days for entities prioritized
at the top of the list and indefinite for those at a lower priority.
Federal agencies and entities in the chemical, emergency services,
energy, financial services, Government facilities, transportation,
water and wastewater, food and agriculture, defense industrial base,
and information technology sectors have been impacted. The RVA queue is
dynamic and reprioritized as part of a quarterly scheduling routine.
With current resource capacity, the waiting list for RVAs cannot be
eliminated. Federal agencies and critical infrastructure entities are
regularly added to the schedule. To date 98 RVAs have been completed,
of which 29 were Election-based RVAs. In fiscal year 2019, NPPD plans
to conduct 90 RVAs, of which 30 will be performed on Federal High-Value
Assets. The remaining 60 RVAs will be determined in accordance with our
prioritization process and methodology.
Question 2a. Based on the RVAs that DHS has carried out for State
and local election officials, do most States and localities have the
resources required to sufficiently mitigate their cybersecurity
vulnerabilities (including equipment, staffing, training, and other
components that factor into security)?
Question 2b. If not, how big is the shortfall?
Answer. Through the fiscal year Department of Homeland Security
(DHS) Appropriations Act and a reprogramming request, DHS was provided
with approximately $26 million to support election infrastructure
security activities. These additional funds have been covering a number
of efforts to enhance the security and resilience of election
infrastructure.
NPPD provides assistance to State and local election officials to
help them determine where vulnerabilities may exist. However, decisions
about how to resource election infrastructure security enhancements are
made solely by those officials. Through the Election Assistance
Commission, Congress recently made $380 million in funding available to
State and local election officials to improve cybersecurity of Federal
elections. The money is intended to provide an additional infusion of
funding for new resources and personnel to improve Federal elections.
Congressional support of funding for these activities is appreciated.
Question 3. In the guidance NPPD issued to election officials on
how to spend security funding, NPPD emphasizes the importance of
deploying auditable voting systems.
How important is it that States have auditable paper trails and
conduct post-election audits to verify the digital tallies of election
results?
Answer. As noted in the prior question, through the Election
Assistance Commission, Congress recently made $380 million in funding
available to State and local election officials to improve the
cybersecurity of Federal elections which will provide an additional
infusion of funding for new resources and personnel to improve Federal
elections.
Deploying auditable voting systems is critical to the resilience of
the process and is being prioritized by many States. With the continued
move to auditable systems, post-election auditing has become a common
practice for many election jurisdictions. However, for many offices,
the post-election audit process is time-consuming and costly. Improving
the overall efficiency and effectiveness of post-election audits is a
quick way to improve the overall integrity of the process. Simple steps
like hiring more temporary staff to organize and run the post-election
audit is an effective way to lessen the burden on already over-worked
and under-staffed election offices while improving the overall
resilience of the process.
Question 4. Much of DHS's mission requires close coordination with
other agencies, especially with respect to cybersecurity.
How has the Department's ability to synchronize its cyber mission
with other agencies been affected by the elimination of the
Cybersecurity Coordinator position and the recent high rate of turnover
at the National Security Council?
Answer. Changes made within the National Security Council staff
related to the Cybersecurity Coordinator have had no impact on DHS's
ability to execute its mission. The President has provided clear
direction to DHS and other National security agencies to execute our
authorities and responsibilities. DHS and our interagency partners
continue to coordinate regularly, through the National Security Council
staff, on policy matters and our operational centers.
