BUSINESS MEETING

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 20, 2019
U.S. Senate,
Committee on Environment and Public Works,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:39 a.m., in
room 406, Dirksen Senate Building, Hon. John Barrasso (Chairman
of the Committee) presiding.
Present: Senators Barrasso, Carper, Inhofe, Capito, Braun,
Rounds, Boozman, Ernst, Cardin, Merkley, Gillibrand, and Van
Hollen.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN BARRASSO,
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF WYOMING
Senator Barrasso. Good morning. I call this business
meeting to order.
Today we are going to consider one nomination. Senator
Carper and I have agreed that we will vote at 9:45, and it is 6
minutes away. At that time, I will call up the nomination on
the agenda.
We will not debate the nomination on the agenda while we
vote. Instead, we will debate the nomination on the agenda
before we vote. I will also be happy to recognize any member
who wishes to speak after the voting concludes.
We are going to consider the nomination of Sean O'Donnell
to be the Inspector General of the Environmental Protection
Agency. The full Committee held a hearing on the nominee last
month. Mr. O'Donnell is well qualified and will bring a wealth
of experience and expertise to this critically important
position.
I applaud President Trump's nomination on such an
experienced and dedicated public servant. The Environmental
Protection Agency's Office of Inspector General currently lacks
Senate confirmed leadership. Mr. O'Donnell has the right
experience to fill the void.
For nearly 20 years, Mr. O'Donnell has devoted his career
to public service. Since 2005, he has served as a trial
attorney for the U.S. Department of Justice. He has handled
criminal and civil matters, such as those relating to financial
and government program fraud and public corruption.
Mr. O'Donnell is familiar with the use of sophisticated
investigative and forensic tools. He has managed large
investigative teams of attorneys, of analysts, and
investigators. And he has worked with agents and auditors from
half a dozen offices of inspectors general.
Mr. O'Donnell has received numerous honors and awards for
his work at the Department of Justice. In 2017, he received the
Attorney General's Award for Distinguished Service, the second
highest honor awarded by the department.
That year, he also received the Executive Office for United
States Attorneys Director's Award for Superior Performance by a
Litigative Team.
During the Obama administration, he received a Civil
Division Special Achievement Award and numerous annual quality
service awards.
Mr. O'Donnell's background and experience make him an
exceptional candidate to serve as the Environmental Protection
Agency's Inspector General. I urge all my colleagues to support
his nomination, and I will now turn to the Ranking Member for
his statement.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. THOMAS R. CARPER,
U.S. SENATOR FROM THE STATE OF DELAWARE
Senator Carper. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.
Good morning.
We have, as the Chairman said, one item on our agenda
today, and that is to vote on the nomination of Sean O'Donnell
to be Inspector General of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.
As we know, the EPA has been without a confirmed Inspector
General for over a year now. I believe all of us here today
agree that this is a job that is far too important to be vacant
for this long. So I am glad we are gathered here today to vote
on Mr. O'Donnell's nomination.
As I said at his confirmation hearing, Mr. O'Donnell has a
big job ahead of him. That bears repeating, because the EPA's
mission is ``to protect human health and the environment.'' In
order for the EPA to fulfill that critical mission, the agency
itself must be protected from misconduct or unethical behavior
that could impair it. That oversight responsibility falls in no
small part on the EPA Inspector General.
I had the privilege of meeting with Mr. O'Donnell
privately. Staff and I have listened to his testimony before
this Committee. We have reviewed his answers to the Committee's
questions, and ultimately, I have concluded that Mr. O'Donnell
is well qualified to serve as the EPA Inspector General.
I was encouraged by Mr. O'Donnell's clear commitment to
continue investigations into alleged violations of Government
ethics rules by political leaders, even if those leaders have
resigned their positions. Unfortunately, that did not occur
with all the investigations into former Administrator Pruitt's
deeply unethical behavior.
And Mr. O'Donnell also promised to protect the integrity of
internal and oversight functions within the EPA, especially
when EPA's dedicated career staff are put into the untenable
position of having to oversee or call out improper activities
of senior political appointees.
In recent weeks, we have seen why it is so important for
the EPA Inspector General to be clear about the information it
needs, and that EPA officials are cooperative and responsive in
return. While I am hopeful that the current dispute between the
EPA's chief of staff and the acting inspector general will be
resolved to everyone's satisfaction before Mr. O'Donnell is
confirmed, the dispute illustrates the importance of the role
that Mr. O'Donnell is willing to perform.
With that, Mr. Chairman, I look forward to a brief business
this morning. I want to thank you, along with our colleagues
and members of their staffs for all your work to make this
meeting both swift and productive.
Thanks so much.
Senator Barrasso. Thank you very much, Senator Carper.
Now that enough members have arrived, I would like to move
to a vote on the nominee of today's agenda.
The Ranking Member and I have agreed to a voice vote on the
nominee, and members may choose to have their votes recorded
for the nominee after the voice vote, if they have additional
concerns. I would be happy to listen as well, and keep the
meeting going as long as people want to comment on the nominee.
I would like to call up Presidential Nomination 1158, Sean
O'Donnell, of Maryland, to be Inspector General of the
Environmental Protection Agency. I move to approve and report
the nomination favorably to the Senate.
Is there a second?
Senator Carper. I second.
Senator Barrasso. All those in favor, please say aye.
[Chorus of ayes.]
Senator Barrasso. All those opposed, please say nay.
[No audible response.]
Senator Barrasso. In the opinion of the Chair, the ayes
have it. We have approved Presidential Nominee 1158, which will
be reported favorably to the Senate.
The voting part of the meeting is finished. I would be
happy to recognize any other members who wish to speak or make
a statement on the nomination that we have just approved.
I do ask unanimous consent that the staff have authority to
make technical and conforming changes to the matter approved
today.
Seeing no one seeking recognition, the business meeting is
adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 9:46 a.m., the business meeting was
concluded.]
