Submissions for the Record
Representative Kathy Castor
Select Committee on the Climate Crisis
November 14, 2019
Written Testimony of the Hon. Gilbert ``Gil'' Cisneros
A Representative in Congress from the State of California
Submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Chairwoman Castor, Ranking Member Graves, and members of the House
Select Committee on the Climate Crisis, thank you for allowing me this
opportunity to provide testimony on behalf of the residents of
California's 39th Congressional District on the critical need to reduce
greenhouse gas pollution and ensure our communities are resilient to
the impacts of climate change. In my district, as across the nation and
around the world, we are seeing more and more examples of the immediacy
of this crisis and its harmful effects on our communities.
Just last month, brush fires in Yorba Linda, Brea, Fullerton, and
across my district sparked fear, widespread power outages, and poor air
quality for my constituents. As the world continues to warm, wildfires
are expected to get bigger and more frequent and the science is not in
our favor. Earlier this year, a report by the Union of Concerned of
Scientists projected that without climate action, the annual number of
heat-index days at 90 degrees or higher in Orange County will increase
by 300% by mid-century and over 600% by 2099.
It is our responsibility in Congress to lead our country and the
larger global community to move beyond partisanship and enact prudent
solutions that improve lives and safeguard the future. To truly address
the climate crisis, potential solutions need to be examined across
every aspect of federal policymaking. I urge you to charge Congress
with enacting legislation to (1) advance innovation in the energy
sector to decrease our dependence on carbon; (2) support the deployment
of green transportation infrastructure; (3) modernize Department of
Defense policies to address the national security vulnerabilities of
climate change; (4) help communities prevent climate disasters, rather
than merely respond after the fact; and (5) preserve our natural
resources and open spaces.
SUPPORT RENEWABLE ENERGY DEPLOYMENT
I am a strong supporter of the bipartisan Energy Innovation and
Carbon Dividend Act and urge this committee to closely examine the
proposal. This legislation would put a price on carbon pollution,
speeding our transition to a clean-energy economy by incentivizing
conservation and innovation. It takes a market-based approach that
doesn't grow the size of government, instead returning the revenue
raised directly to households as a dividend. The bill projects
reductions in carbon pollution of 90 percent by 2050, compared with
2016 levels, while especially protecting the interests of those in the
middle class and at the margins.
Our tax code should incentivize clean energy use. Earlier this
month, I joined my fellow members of the New Democrat Coalition,
Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition, and the Congressional
Progressive Caucus in calling for prioritization of legislation to
advance clean energy tax policies by the end of the year to help us
attain our emissions reductions goal and combat climate change. Tax
incentives to promote energy storage, zero emission vehicles, offshore
wind, and energy efficiency are critical to promoting cleaner energy
use among individuals and businesses.
ADVANCE GREEN TRANSPORTATION INITIATIVES
I urge the Committee to support deployment of green transportation
infrastructure, creating jobs while addressing climate change. In 2017,
the transportation sector accounted for 29% of our nation's total
emissions of 6.4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
Encouraging better emission vehicles and improved transit systems to
reduce greenhouse gas emissions must be a component of your climate
change plan.
In California, we are already taking major steps towards addressing
climate change in our transportation systems by requiring all public
transit buses to switch from dirty diesel fuel to zero-emission
technology. Transit agencies in my district have admirably fully
embraced this challenge, navigating new logistical challenges for how
to best install charging stations throughout their existing systems
with limited financial and technical support from the federal
government. I support H.R. 2164, the Green Bus Act, to help replicate
this success nationwide but urge you to ensure increased federal
support is available. If other communities are to follow California's
lead, the federal government must play a leadership role in providing
technical and financial assistance to ensure seamless deployment.
While several car companies have made great strides to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions through better fuel economy in their vehicles,
more needs to be done. I was highly disappointed with the President's
decision to abandon the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) for model
years 2021 to 2025. These regulations were carefully negotiated with
manufacturers, labor, and environmental groups to reduce pollution and
spur innovation within the industry. I support legislation, H.R. 978,
the Clean and Efficient Cars Act of 2019, to preserve these fuel
economy and vehicle emission standards that reduce greenhouse gas
emissions and save drivers money at the pump.
DEFENSE
We must protect our nation's foreign policy interests and those of
our military. As the Pentagon's own reports consistently confirm, the
effects of a changing climate are a national security issue. Climate
change makes our military bases more vulnerable and missions more
complicated. That's why I worked to secure a provision in the House-
approved Fiscal Year 2020 National Defense Authorization Act directing
the Department of Defense to explore the possibility of maintaining
plug-in hybrid and electric government vehicle fleets on military
installations. It also directs the Pentagon to consider building
microgrid infrastructure to support green vehicles and secure systems
to support them.
I also support legislation H.R. 1201, Climate Change National
Security Act, which would restore directives on national security and
climate change requiring the federal government to consider the impacts
of climate change in the development of relevant national security
policies. Further, I support H.R. 2759, Department of Defense Climate
Resiliency & Readiness Act, which would direct the Department of
Defense to take a number of steps to make the Department more climate
resilient, including establishing key benchmarks for energy goals,
increasing transparency in contracting, and directing Departmental
focus on climate and resiliency.
PREVENT CLIMATE DISASTERS
Like many states, California has been directly impacted by the
devastating natural disasters exacerbated by climate change. Millions
of dollars are spent fighting intensifying blazes during our now year-
round fire season in California. We must invest in research nationwide
on fire-related issues to advance seasonal wildfire forecasts, but also
help forestry agencies prepare for wildfire events to mediate their
devastating effects. I support legislation like H.R. 4924, the Smoke
Planning and Research Act, to help state and local governments protect
their communities from the public risks of wildfire smokes.
PRESERVE OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND OPEN SPACES
We must prioritize the conservation of our public natural lands.
Protection of our natural lands is a win for both the environment and
for the reduction of greenhouse gases, as national parks, forests, and
other public lands have been valued for their ability to absorb and
store carbon and other air pollutants.
This is why I support H.R. 3195, the Land and Water Conservation
Fund Permanent Funding Act, which would provide for permanent funding
dedicated to the Land and Water Conservation Fund to protect
conservation funds.
Thank you again for your time and consideration. I know you have a
tough job ahead of you and I hope you will keep my testimony on behalf
of my constituents in California's 39th Congressional District in mind
as you recommend policies to advance as it relates to our nation's
strategy in combating climate change.
Written Testimony of the Hon. Anna G. Eshoo
A Representative in Congress from the State of California
Submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you, Chair Castor and Ranking Member Graves, for the
opportunity to testify at the Member Day hearing of the Select
Committee on the Climate Crisis. I appreciate your invitation to
contribute to your important work as you work toward solutions to the
existential threat of climate change.
While there is no denying the scientific consensus that human
activity is driving climate change, it is worth reviewing the facts to
emphasize the scale of our challenge. The Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC) found that global temperatures are likely to rise
1.5+C above pre-industrial levels between 2030 and 2052. This will have
severe environmental impacts including a rise in sea levels, the loss
of snow-pack, a thaw of the permafrost, higher ocean temperatures,
increased ocean acidity, more intense hurricanes, stronger storms,
longer droughts, and more severe flooding. If temperatures continue to
rise to 2+C above pre-industrial levels, 50 million people will be
displaced by rising sea levels; 350 million people will endure severe
drought; and more than a billion people will experience extreme heat
waves.
The time for debate on the causes of climate change is over, and we
have limited time to implement solutions. Fortunately, the Speaker
tasked this Committee with recommending ``policies, strategies, and
innovations to achieve substantial and permanent reductions in
pollution and other activities that contribute to the climate crisis
which will honor our responsibility to be good stewards of the planet
for future generations.'' As you finalize your recommendations, I'd
like to share a few principles to guide your work.
First, any recommendations must be informed by science and
proportionate to the scope of our challenges. The IPCC report estimates
that in order to keep average temperatures from increasing beyond
1.5+C, we need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 45 percent in the
next decade and reach net zero emissions by 2050. This should be the
benchmark for the Committee's work because established science should
guide informed policy decisions.
Second, while we should be ambitious in our goals, we must be
pragmatic in how we achieve them which means embracing a broad range of
policies to address the crisis. There are no silver bullets in climate
policy. Tax credits and research backed by the federal government have
led to the development of many forms of renewable energy, including
some invented in my congressional district. As we continue to support
renewable energy, we should also discourage the use of fossil fuels
through a price on carbon, such as a carbon tax or cap and trade
system. These complimentary policies are both necessary because relying
on a narrow set of solutions will make it much harder to cut emissions
before the science tells us it's too late.
Finally, I encourage you to look to the example of states that have
taken the lead on climate policy, including California. My state has
adopted cap and trade, a low carbon fuel standard, a renewable
portfolio standard, and a zero-emission vehicles mandate, among other
policies. Thanks to these efforts, California hit its initial carbon
reduction goals four years ahead of schedule while our economy
continues to grow. Federal policy can learn from and improve upon these
successes. The Committee should also ensure that action from the
federal government, while sorely needed, does not constrain states and
local governments that have led the way in reducing emissions.
Thank you again for the opportunity to share these principles with
you today. I look forward to your recommendations which I will take
back to my committee, Energy and Commerce, as we write comprehensive
legislation to address this existential threat. Our challenges are
enormous, but we owe it to future generations to leave them a planet
that is not greatly diminished from the one we have today.
Written Testimony of the Hon. Adriano Espaillat
A Representative in Congress from the State of New York
Submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you for accepting our testimony, today, Madam Chair.
Mitigating and adapting to climate change is the issue of our time.
It is an existential problem, one that we have waited much too long to
take seriously, and we are already paying the price for that. And it is
frontline communities, communities of color, indigenous communities,
women, children, migrants, people with disabilities, and other
marginalized communities who bear the greatest burden, though they
contribute the least to the causes of climate change. A recent study
published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the
United States of America makes this incredibly clear. It finds that
Black and Hispanic individuals in the United States on average bear a
``pollution burden'' of 56 percent and 63 percent excess exposure,
respectively, relative to the exposure caused by their consumption.\1\
But I don't need statistics to know that air pollution in Washington
Heights makes my grandson's asthma worse, and that it is not my
neighbors in Washington Heights, Harlem, Inwood or the Bronx that are
the greatest contributors to pollution that affects our health or
contributes to climate change.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When the House passed the Climate Action Now Act earlier this year,
it included an amendment of mine that simply stated that climate
justice and environmental justice must be included in our efforts to
meet the Paris Agreement and mitigate and adapt to climate change. This
must be a core tenet of all our policies to address climate change.
Every law we pass, every action to mitigate and adapt to climate change
must include acknowledgement of and protections for marginalized and
frontline communities who bear the burden climate change. My
predecessor, the great Adam Clayton Powell Jr., one of the great Civil
Rights leaders, led his Powell Amendments to ensure federal funding did
not support segregation. Environmental justice is my Powell Amendment,
and I want to work with you to ensure that in every bill this House
considers, environmental justice is upheld.
We need serious investments to mitigate and adapt to climate
change. But it will cost us more in the long-term if we do not act now,
financially and existentially. By the time a child born today retires,
2085, the U.S. will be spending $300 billion each year on climate
resiliency. The time to invest is now. In fact, the time to invest was
two decades ago, but here we are. We need serious investment in our
infrastructure and our transportation systems. We need to invest in
green roof technology and innovative urban agriculture to address not
just the carbon emissions of the agricultural field, but to also
address the intersectional issues of food security and climate change.
I want to also recognize that climate change does not just require
domestic commitments. Climate change is an international problem that
requires international solutions. That is why I have introduced H.R.
4986, the Green Climate Fund Authorization Act of 2019, which now has
10 cosponsors and counting, in response to the Trump Administration
formally announcing U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement last week.
The Green Climate Fund is an independent, multilateral fund established
by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to help
developing countries limit or reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and
adapt to climate change. Developing counties have limited capacity to
reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, and through the Green Climate
Fund the U.S. can contribute our fair share enable mitigation and
adaptation activities that uphold environmental justice around the
globe. Because it is these exact nations that are also on the frontline
of climate change, though they too contribute the least to its causes.
Written Testimony of the Hon. Paul Gosar
A Representative in Congress from the State of Arizona
Submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Madam Chair and Ranking Member, thank you for the opportunity to
come before you today to present recommendations to move America
forward creating a stronger more secure future. I am Rep. Paul Gosar
and I represent the Fourth District of Arizona as well as the current
Chairman of the Congressional Western Caucus.
Regardless of your position on the issues before this Committee we
all know that America will need to build more electricity generation
and transmission and will face a greater demand for critical minerals
and the land access that this development demands. In my testimony
today I will highlight the challenges and opportunities that we face in
bringing this energy future to fruition.
PLREDA
The first bill I would like to highlight is my bill H.R. 3794, the
Public Land Renewable Energy Development Act. Joining me supporting
this bill are such radical conservatives as Rep. Jared Huffman and Rep.
Raul Grijalva. Renewable energy sources like wind, solar and geothermal
are an integral part of the United States' all-of-the-above energy
strategy. Our nation's public lands can play a critical role in
supporting that mission. While approximately 40% of total geothermal
electric generating capacity comes from federal lands, only about 5% of
total utility-scale wind energy capacity and utility-scale solar energy
capacity comes from public lands. This bipartisan bill develops a
streamlined process that will drive investment towards the highest
quality renewable sources. This legislation uses upfront planning and
careful siting to identify appropriate areas for wind, solar and
geothermal energy. In addition, PLREDA incentivizes development in
these lower-conflict priority areas, while ensuring impacts to
wildlife, habitat and cultural resources are avoided and minimized. The
bill also directs agencies to provide staffing resources to ensure
project permitting moves forward as efficiently as possible.
I would encourage committee members to join in support of this
legislation and help us see it enacted soon.
TRANSMISSION AND GENERATION
American demand for electricity is growing and everything from
smart phones to electric cars will continue to increase our domestic
demand for electricity. Recent efforts by cities and states to ban
household use of natural gas will only exacerbate our demand for
electricity. That demand growth will put increase pressure on our need
for increased transmission capacity and the massive challenges of
building significant new energy projects. As we have seen, poor
environmental planning and maintenance can have devastating impacts on
transmission particularly in rural areas susceptible to wildfires.
Beyond that, the simple process of building and installing any new
significant construction is riddled with massive challenges and
problems. It is important to consider what it takes to build new
transmission. I present a case from my home state, the SunZia Southwest
Transmission Project consists of 520 miles of two single-circuit 500 kV
transmission lines to connect and deliver electricity generated in
Arizona and New Mexico to population centers in the Desert Southwest.
This was a project built specifically to meet the demand for
renewable energy from populations further West. In order to build these
lines, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), along with fourteen
cooperating agencies, led the effort to comply with the National
Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). That process started in 2008, was
completed after a six and half year effort to comply with NEPA
finalizing on January 23, 2015, when BLM issued a Record of Decision
approving SunZia's application for a right-of-way across federally
owned property. Again, a single transmission line, servicing only
renewable energy needed nearly 7 years of environmental review under
NEPA.
But it isn't just transmission, pipelines in America are facing
massive obstacles as well and construction and operation of more
pipelines will be critical to a cleaner future. The prompt approval of
pipelines for methane capture and distribution can prevent flaring and
methane emissions while providing clean natural gas for markets and
industrial use. In addition, new pipelines for carbon capture and reuse
will provide us new opportunities for both carbon sequestration and
enhanced oil recovery.
And it isn't just power distribution but generation as well, right
now offshore in the Atlantic the Vineyard Wind project has been in the
NEPA process for 18 months. This summer the Administration was required
to delay the NEPA approval to conduct additional cumulative impact
assessments on offshore wind's impact on fisheries. This action was
driven in part by a request from the Rhode Island Congressional
delegation that asked, 17 months into the NEPA process, for a 2-year
delay for a baseline fishing research study. It is nearly impossible
for new massive investment of capital to come into the United States
when the NEPA process is so fundamentally broken.
MINERALS
Finally, the last issue of my focus today is that of critical
minerals. As the need more electricity in our future, we will need more
critical minerals like cobalt, lithium and copper and access to rare
earths and helium.
Today, we have allowed our domestic rare earth mines to be closed,
shredding our domestic security by forcing our industrial and Defense
apparatus to depend on Chinese rare earth materials. In May of 2019,
President Xi Jinping (zhe--jingping) made a visit to the heart of
China's critical minerals industrial complex. He stated during this
visit, ``We are here at the starting point of the Long March to
remember the time when the Red Army began its journey. We are now
embarking on a new Long March, and we must start all over again.''
His words came a week after Chinese state media proposed the idea
of completely banning critical mineral exports to the United States.
Currently, the United States relies on China for 20 different critical
minerals which include several rare earth materials defined by the
Department of Defense. This irrational overreliance threatens our
national security by imperiling our ability to make equipment and
weapons integral to mission success. Rare earth materials are used in
numerous modern technologies including missile guidance and control
systems, lasers for enemy mine detection, satellite communications,
radar, sonar on submarines, iPhones, electric vehicles, wind turbines,
solar panels, computers and networks.
But it isn't just rare earths that threaten our security, it is our
complete position on domestic mining. From the Rosemont Mine and
Resolution Copper projects in Arizona, to Twin Metals in Minnesota and
numerous projects across Alaska, Wyoming and Nevada. Our nation needs
more copper, zinc and cobalt to achieve a cleaner energy future. Yet
the permitting process for these projects is measured in hundreds of
millions of dollars and decades of permitting. It faces reckless
legislating from Congress working to pass moratoriums on mineral
development, undo land exchanges passed by the will of the people.
Effort after effort to undercut the domestic development of the
resources to secure our nation. If we want a more reliable electric
future, we will need these minerals. The choice is clear, support more
mining and an electrified future or simply serve word salad to gullible
activists while fundamentally failing to take the necessary steps to
secure America.
CLOSING
Finally, in closing, the United States is the greatest
CO2 success story on the planet. The Paris agreement was
nothing more than an effort to extort America to pay the world for a
sin created by an international bureaucratic cabal. We have lead the
world in CO2 reduction and we should work to export our
success to the rest of the world with more LNG to Europe and allies in
Asia.
Written Testimony of the Hon. Debra ``Deb'' Haaland
A Representative in Congress from the State of New Mexico
Submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Chairwoman Castor, Ranking Member Graves, members of the committee
including my good friend from New Mexico, Assistant Speaker Lujan,
thank you for the opportunity to testify and for your leadership on
this important issue.
This summer, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported
that the climate crisis is undermining the ability of our lands to
sustain people, wildlife, and plants.
Deforestation, intensive farming practices, and fossil fuel
production are contributing to worsening drought, increasing soil
erosion, more intense wildfires, and diminishing crop yields.
We see this in New Mexico, where we have a methane cloud the size
of Delaware hovering over the northwest portion of our state due to
leakage from oil and gas extraction. Our state is the fifth driest
state in the nation, and we've been experiencing a long-term drought
for years.
All communities have a right to breathe clean air, live free from
toxic pollution, have access to healthy food, and share the benefits of
economic prosperity, but in New Mexico and elsewhere, low income
communities and communities of color have borne the greatest burdens
from pollution, climate change, and economic inequality.
Fortunately, New Mexico is blessed with over 300 days of sunshine
each year and abundant wind resources, and our state passed legislation
to support the swift transition to clean energy and away from dirty
fossil fuels and support the state's energy workforce.
I urge you to develop legislative recommendations that will drive a
vibrant renewable energy economy that will create millions of high-
quality, safe, family sustaining jobs and reduce our impact on the
climate.
I've been working on some legislation to address this existential
challenge.
My Climate Stewardship Act aims to support natural climate
solutions by boosting funding for programs that encourage sustainable
farming practices, reforestation, and wetland restoration. It also
promotes urban forestry and re-establishes the Civilian Conservation
Corps, creating job opportunities for low income youth.
As Vice-Chair of the Natural Resources Committee and Chairwoman of
the National Parks, Forests, and Public Lands subcommittee, I'm working
with Chairman Grijalva on upcoming legislation to reduce the impact of
our public lands on the climate.
I'm also part of an effort to build support for the goal of a 100%
Clean Economy with net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, which the
science tells us is necessary to protect public health and our
environment. Our bill, which we will introduce soon, tasks federal
agencies with developing plans to achieve this goal that must protect
vulnerable communities and ensure a just transition from fossil fuels
that will create millions of jobs for all Americans.
And I support the Green New Deal, which would build on this goal
and revamp the American economy to reduce emissions and create a more
just and fair economic system.
I also urge you to recommend tax policies that drive investments in
energy efficiency and renewable energy including: investment and
production tax credits; incentives for energy efficiency retrofits,
alternative fuel vehicles and infrastructure, and energy storage; and
to ensure that these benefit all communities.
To increase integration of renewable energy, I also encourage you
to support the deployment of a modernized, smart electric grid,
including advanced transmission technologies to improve efficiency and
making it easier to build transmission lines, a topic that I am working
on legislation on.
We can also reduce our impact on the climate by supporting
recycling and composting and promoting waste prevention, which reduces
greenhouse gas emissions from landfills and incinerators, returns
carbon to the ground, and reduces the need for chemical fertilizers.
Thank you again for your leadership on these issues and for the
opportunity to testify. The future of our planet is in our hands.
Written Testimony of the Hon. Andrew ``Andy'' Levin
A Representative in Congress from the State of Michigan
Submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Chairwoman Castor and Ranking Member Graves: thank you for the
opportunity to provide testimony on behalf of Michigan's Ninth
Congressional District as you consider policy ideas for reducing
greenhouse gas pollution and ensuring our communities are resilient to
the impacts of climate change. On behalf of my constituents, I would
like to highlight the need for action on electric vehicle (EV) charging
infrastructure, on green transportation infrastructure more broadly,
and on zero-net energy buildings.
EV charging infrastructure
As our nation's transportation sector has become increasingly
responsible for overall greenhouse gas emissions, plug-in EVs--which
have 54 percent lower lifetime carbon pollution than conventional
vehicles--can help us reduce emissions and move us closer to climate
sustainability.\1\ \2\ Demand for EV chargers is only expected to grow
in the coming decade: EV charging needs will rise from 6 billion kWh in
2020 to 53 billion kWh in 2030, and the number of chargers needed is
estimated to rise from 2 million in 2020 to 13 million in 2030.\3\

Pollution from Transportation and Improve Air Quality. https://

\3\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We need to lead the world in protecting our environment, and that
must include improving EV consumer experiences so that we may end our
dependence on conventional vehicles. Range anxiety, charge times, and
charging costs currently preclude the paradigm shift necessary for a
sustainable automotive future. To encourage our country`s needed shift
to EVs, I plan to introduce the EV Freedom Act, a bill establishing a
network of EV charging stations at small businesses and other locations
along the Interstate Highway System.
Green Transportation Infrastructure
Transportation represents the largest source of greenhouse
emissions of any sector at about 29 percent of U.S. emissions.\4\ I
believe we need to simultaneously tackle the climate crisis and our
crumbling infrastructure by taking a big, bold step towards total
transportation electrification.

Greenhouse Gas Emissions. https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/sources-
greenhouse-gas-emissions.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Any effort to electrify our transportation infrastructure must
include funding for roads, bridges, and rail, while also dramatically
electrifying our public transportation systems. We need to require
renewable energy generation that offsets energy consumed by the
electrified infrastructure system we will build. All of this must be
done in a manner that ensures we take care of American workers now,
while securing the automotive and infrastructure jobs of the future. I
am working on relevant legislation that will be responsive to the
urgent need to create a green national infrastructure, and I look
forward to partnering with this Committee on that critically needed
effort.
Zero-net energy buildings
In its 2015 Quadrennial Technology Review, the U.S. Department of
Energy found that the buildings sector accounts for about 76 percent of
electricity use and 40 percent of all U.S. primary energy use and
associated greenhouse gas emissions.\5\ The report also found that the
implementation of the best available energy efficiency technologies in
the nation`s current building stock would reduce commercial energy
consumption by 46 percent.\6\

technologies and research opportunities. Quadrennial Technology Review.

chapter5.pdf.
\6\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a former clean energy entrepreneur, I have seen first-hand the
potential to address our climate crisis through solutions that produce
more efficient commercial buildings while also spurring cost savings
and job growth. I believe we must move much faster with respect to the
efficiency of both current and new building infrastructure, which is
why I support requiring that all new buildings, including small
businesses, be zero-net energy--i.e., new buildings should produce as
much energy as they consume. To achieve this rapidly, we must increase
our investments in grant programs that establish or expand financing
for small business energy efficiency projects. Such investments will
help us reduce our carbon footprint, create jobs, and move towards a
cleaner, stronger economy.
I respectfully request that the Committee bear these priorities in
mind when determining appropriate courses of action that promote
sustainability for our communities and our environment. Climate change
poses an existential threat to humanity, and we will not have to wait
for sea levels or temperatures to rise even further to feel that
impact--it is making us less safe right now. Even the Department of
Defense just this year said, ``the effects of a changing climate are a
national security issue with potential impacts to DOD missions,
operational plans and installations.'' \7\ If we do not act urgently
and boldly, we will have shirked our solemn responsibility to ensure
the safety and wellbeing of the American people.

Written Testimony of the Hon. Elaine G. Luria
A Representative in Congress from the State of Virginia
Submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
In Coastal Virginia, climate change is not a problem for tomorrow;
it is one we face every day. As the Select Committee considers policy
recommendations, I hope your work will prioritize national security,
clean energy, and resilient communities.
National Security
The Department of Defense's 2019 Report on the Effects of a
Changing Climate found that 60 of the 79 highest priority military
installations in the U.S. are or will be at risk of recurrent flooding,
48 are or will be at risk of drought, and 43 are or will be at risk of
wildfires as a result of climate change.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coastal Virginia is at particular risk. The report finds ``Navy
Region Mid-Atlantic and the greater Hampton Roads area is one of the
most vulnerable to flooding military operational installation areas in
the United States,'' \2\ and identifies Naval Station Norfolk, Joint
Base Langley-Eustis, and Naval Air Station Oceana as at high risk for
recurrent flooding. One study found that, by mid-century, the main road
to Naval Station Norfolk will flood at high tide every day.\3\ Further
research shows that major military installations in the U.S. will face
an average of more than a month of additional days with heat indexes
above 100+ F.\4\ Military readiness will suffer if our service members
cannot safely get to or from base or conduct training exercises.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to its visible impacts on our military installations,
climate change also fosters global political instability. Studies have
indicated that weather events associated with climate change may have
contributed to the start of the Arab Spring \5\ and the Syrian Civil
War.\6\ A recent comprehensive study in the journal Nature found that
climate change has already contributed to armed conflicts over the past
half century, and that ``intensifying climate change is estimated to
increase future risk of conflict'' through factors such as drought,
flooding, and resource scarcity.\7\ Mitigating these threats would
reduce the need to send our service members into harm`s way.

To address these risks, the Committee`s recommendations should
require DOD to consider climate change at all stages of planning and
decision-making. I was troubled by recent reporting that the Navy
dismantled its task force dedicated to climate planning.\8\ Instead of
ramping down such efforts, DOD should establish similar task forces
within each service branch as well as a dedicated team of civilian
climate experts to advise DOD senior leadership. Additionally, as the
world`s single largest institutional greenhouse gas producer,\9\ the
Committee should recommend that DOD be required to implement a plan to
significantly reduce emissions by 2050.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clean Energy
We must reduce all net greenhouse gas emissions within the U.S. to
zero by 2050 at the latest. Clear and consistent market-based rules,
coupled with robust investments in carbon-free energy technologies,
will cut pollution and make the U.S. the world leader in the 21st
century clean economy. Coastal Virginia is uniquely positioned to
flourish as we transition to clean energy. By 2026, the waters off
Virginia Beach could host the largest offshore wind project in the
nation.\10\ The Committee should build on this momentum by including
recommendations for extending and expanding tax credits for clean
energy generation, energy efficiency, and battery storage.

The Committee`s recommendations for clean energy legislation should
include nuclear power as part of the solution. As a former nuclear
engineer in the Navy, I know that nuclear power, when deployed safely
and responsibly, can play a key role in decarbonizing our economy.
Modeling performed by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has
found that nuclear energy can dramatically reduce the cost of deep
decarbonization by providing a constant flow of power that can
complement the more intermittent power generated by wind and solar.\11\
Nuclear power also has the potential to reduce emissions from the
difficult-to-decarbonize industrial sector.\12\

Resilient Communities
Our transition to clean energy must be coupled with investments in
communities facing the brunt of climate change impacts. State and local
governments in coastal communities throughout the U.S., including in
Coastal Virginia, cannot bear the costs of sea level rise alone.
Hampton Roads is experiencing the fastest rate of sea level rise of
any region along the East Coast.\13\ A study commissioned by the City
of Virginia Beach found that the cost of infrastructure to combat sea
level rise could be up to $3.8 billion.\14\ A separate study has found
that the cost just of building sea walls in the Hampton Roads area will
be over $4.6 billion.\15\

Communities in Coastal Virginia are stepping up to meet this
challenge. Norfolk has proposed over $1 billion to fight sea level rise
and Virginia Beach plans to spend $450 million in stormwater projects
over the next five years.\16\ All cities within the region participate
in the Hampton Roads Planning District Commission, which is

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Although local communities are doing their part, only the federal
government has the resources, expertise, and legal authority to address
sea level rise and other climate effects in a comprehensive manner.
This Committee should support policies to dramatically increase
investment in the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)'s pre-
disaster mitigation funding and consider additional financing solutions
such as revolving loan funds for resiliency projects. While these
initiatives will involve substantial up-front costs, building
resiliency can deliver taxpayers a return of up to six-to-one in
averted disaster losses.\18\

The Committee should also consider ways to improve information
sharing about sea level rise and recurrent flooding. This could be
accomplished by strengthening the mandates of the federal agencies
conducting oceanic and sea level rise research, including the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA), and FEMA, to ensure that they are
effectively sharing data and analysis with local governments and
communities threatened by flooding.
Conclusion
I thank the Committee for providing the opportunity for all Members
to share solutions and stories of how climate change affects their
communities. I look forward to working with the Committee to develop
policies that support coastal communities, safeguard our national
security, and position the United States to become the world leader of
the clean energy economy.
Written Testimony of the Hon. Markwayne Mullin
A Representative in Congress from the State of Oklahoma
Submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Chairwoman Castor, Ranking Member Graves, thank you for allowing me
to submit my testimony for the record.
The United States is in the middle of an energy renaissance. We are
producing more energy in the United States than ever before. At the
same time, we are leading the world in carbon emission reduction. This
is in part due to the increase of natural gas in our energy mix.
Natural gas paired with renewables like wind and solar is a great
way to reduce carbon emissions. In my home state of Oklahoma, which one
might normally think of as an oil and gas state, is now the second
largest producer of wind energy in the nation. We have plenty of wind
and plenty of gas.
Congress is too hasty to pick winners and losers in our energy
industry. I believe we need to take an all-of-the-above approach that
uses all of resources. However, one type of energy is consistently
forgotten about in conversations around Capitol Hill--Renewable Natural
Gas.
Renewable Natural Gas (RNG), or biomethane, is captured above
ground from organic material in agriculture, wastewater, landfill, or
food waste. In simpler terms, this technology takes methane, which is
worse for the air than carbon dioxide, cleans and purifies it, and
sticks it straight into a natural gas pipeline which can be used for
natural gas vehicles, electricity generation, and home heating.
When using RNG it produces a net carbon-neutral and even carbon-
negative results.\1\ Over the last five years, RNG has increased 577
percent, displacing seven million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent.
And unlike wind and solar, this renewable energy is not intermittent.
RNG can be produced 24/7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

road-fuel-reaches-historical-high/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some of my colleagues want to support the Green New Deal, whose
creators say we need to get rid of cows because of their methane
producing flatulence. However, using RNG we take that methane out of
the atmosphere and turn it into clean renewable fuel. From cow farts to
clean energy--that could be the future.
I urge my colleagues as we look at ways to reduce our emissions, we
look at the benefits of all energy sources, including RNG. We need to
lead the innovation here in the United States so that we can export our
technologies to the world and be a leader in clean and efficient
energy.
Written Testimony of the Hon. Robert ``Bobby'' Scott
A Representative in Congress from the State of Virginia
Submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you, Chairwoman Castor, Ranking Member Graves and members of
the Committee on the Climate Crisis for providing me this opportunity
to discuss some of the priorities I believe should be reflected in this
Committee's work.
I represent the 3rd congressional district of Virginia where the
Chesapeake Bay meets the James, Nansemond, and Elizabeth Rivers, which
presents both challenges and opportunities. Our waterways are essential
to Virginia and the nation. Hampton Roads is home to the largest naval
base in the world, Naval Station Norfolk, the one of the busiest ports
on the eastern seaboards, the Port of Virginia and multiple shipyards.
The recurrent flooding that we are already living with poses a severe
national security risk. With 95 percent of our nation's trade moving by
water, it is also essential that the port is able to maintain
operations as the waters continue to rise. Our waterways keep our
economy moving and the communities that support these operations are
already living with the effects of climate change and rising waters.
I had the pleasure of showing Chairwoman Castor around Hampton
Roads earlier this year. We heard from state and local elected
officials in Virginia who already recognize the significant threat that
sea level rise poses and have been working to combat these effects.
Unfortunately, the cost to proactively and aggressively address this
problem head-on is far too great for any city to bear by itself. While
Norfolk and other cities in Hampton Roads have already spent
considerable sums of money to study the recurrent flooding issues and
implement resilient infrastructure, the shear scope of the project to
address the problem will cost billions of dollars and require the
federal government to step in and assist.
I encourage you to review the Building Up Infrastructure and
Limiting Disasters through Resilience (BUILD Resilience) Act,
legislation that I introduced last Congress with Senators Mark Warner
and Tim Kaine and that I intend to introduce again soon. The BUILD
Resilience Act would establish a competitive grant program for
resilient infrastructure investment to bolster the ability of regions,
such as Hampton Roads and New Orleans, to implement projects and
strategies to reduce regional vulnerability to threats like sea level
rise and recurrent flooding. Analyses by the Congressional Budget
Office and the Multi-hazard Mitigation Council of the National
Institute of Building Sciences estimate that every $1 invested in
resilient infrastructure upfront saves $3 to $4 in future losses on the
back-end after a major disaster strikes.
As this committee continues to hear and plan for the effects of
climate change, I urge you to make federal investments in resilient
infrastructure a priority. Investing upfront can help save taxpayers
and impacted communities potentially billions of dollars in avoided
costs. Recognizing the disproportionate risk that climate chaos poses
to low-income communities and communities of color, I urge the
committee to center equity in such efforts.
Ms. Chairwoman, thank you again for allowing me the opportunity to
share my priorities for addressing climate change as we deal with the
effects in Hampton Roads. I look forward to working with you to ensure
that we put forth policies that effectively deal with the changes we
are already seeing.
Written Testimony of the Hon. Haley Stevens
A Representative in Congress from the State of Michigan
Submitted to the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Dear Chairwoman Castor, Ranking Member Graves, and Members of the
House Select Committee on the Climate Crisis: Thank you for allowing me
this opportunity to provide testimony on the urgent need to address the
climate crisis, build out our clean energy infrastructure, and promote
our transition to a sustainable 21st Century economy.
In August, I had the honor of hosting Chairwoman Castor for a town
hall in Michigan's 11th District to discuss electric vehicles and clean
transportation. During the discussion, we heard from a panel of experts
who made it clear that encouraging greater production and consumer
adoption of electric vehicles is key to hitting our sustainability
goals while creating new economic opportunities right here in the
United States. As electric vehicle technology proliferates, I urge the
Select Committee to ensure that the next generation of automobiles are
being built by American workers.
I would also like to urge Members of the Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis to promote and encourage the practice of
remanufacturing, which is the process by which used products are
returned to good-as-new (or better) condition. The International Trade
Commission estimates that remanufacturing has already added over
180,000 jobs in the U.S., with an enormous potential for growth. In
addition to creating jobs, remanufacturing reduces the strain of
industrial processes on the environment and lowers the cost of
production for manufacturers. Remanufacturing and comprehensive
refurbishment has the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by
between 79 percent and 99 percent in appropriate sectors.
Finally, I would like to affirm my strong support for tax
incentives to encourage investment and innovation in clean electricity,
clean transportation, and energy efficiency. Right now, the U.S. tax
system provides permanent subsidies to polluting industries while
leaving clean, renewable energy companies in the lurch. We must take
advantage of the opportunity to make smart investments in clean energy
to help the U.S. reduce carbon pollution and prepare our communities
for the damaging effects of rising sea levels, severe weather and
catastrophic wildfires.
We need to seize hold of the opportunity to tackle climate change
by making major investments in our infrastructure and our workforce,
while fostering innovation and job creation. Thank you again for your
time and consideration. I hope you will keep these issues in mind as
you craft policies to address the threat of global climate change.
Sincerely,
Haley M. Stevens,
Member of Congress.
Ms. Castor. I recognize myself for 5 minutes for a short
opening statement.
I want to thank the Members who have come to speak before
us today. Speaker Pelosi created the select committee with a
broad but important task: to explore policy solutions to the
climate crisis and make recommendations to committees of
jurisdiction. We have embraced this charge with all of the
seriousness it deserves. We have held 13 hearings and 4
roundtables, held hundreds of in-person stakeholder meetings,
and issued a request for information that promises to generate
hundreds of comments.
But we want to hear from fellow Members of Congress as
well. Although Congress has not considered comprehensive
climate legislation in a decade, Members, particularly on the
Democratic side, have not been idle. They've been doing the
work, meeting with stakeholders, and drafting legislation to
cut carbon pollution and make our communities more resilient to
the impacts of climate change.
Today will be a good reminder, when it comes to developing
national climate policy, we are not starting from a blank sheet
of paper.
Thank you all for being here today.
I now recognize the ranking member, if he has any comments.
Otherwise, we can get going and hear from our Members.
Mr. Carter. We can get started.
Ms. Castor. Terrific. Thank you, Mr. Carter.
Without objection, members who wish to enter opening
statements into the record may have 5 business days to do so.
Now it is time hear from our witnesses. In order to fit in
as many Members as we can, all statements should be no longer
than 5 minutes, and I request that any questions be as brief as
possible. Of course, we will follow up with your staff if we
want additional information.
So, Ms. Underwood, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
Welcome.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. LAUREN UNDERWOOD, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
Ms. Underwood. Thank you, Madam Chair, for providing this
opportunity for Members to share their priorities with the
Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.
The very existence of this committee is a testament to the
urgency of this crisis and the House's commitment to tackling
it head-on. I am grateful to come before the committee today to
bring attention to the important need for congressional action
to address climate change.
The science is clear: We are on an alarming path. Our
climate is changing, presenting an existential threat to our
environment, our national security, our health, and our
economy.
As the country looks to its leaders to take Federal action
to address climate change, I am proud to have supported H.R. 9,
the Climate Action Now Act, which is the first major climate
legislation passed by the House in nearly a decade.
I was honored to continue this effort when I introduced
H.R. 3819, the Climate and Health Protection Act, with my
colleague and former Secretary for Health and Human Services,
Representative Donna Shalala.
As a public health nurse, I fully recognize the adverse
impact climate change will have on public health, particularly
for the most vulnerable people in our society--pregnant women,
children, the elderly, and countless others.
My bill protects the Centers for Disease Control's Climate
and Health Program. This program is the only office within the
Department of Health and Human Services dedicated to helping
State and local governments prepare for the public health
consequences of climate change.
Secondly, my bill increases funding for the program to $15
million, which is consistent with the funding provided in the
House's fiscal year 2020 appropriations package.
Without the resources and the services provided by the
Climate and Health Program, many communities across the country
will be left vulnerable and unaware of the devastating health
consequences climate change poses. I appreciate the Committee
on Energy and Commerce's oversight work on this
administration's decision to limit the Climate and Health
Program. In addition to continuing that work, we must pass my
Climate and Health Protection Act to reinstate and protect this
vital program.
It is an honor to represent the people of the 14th District
of Illinois, who know that it is long past time to take serious
steps to address climate change, or we risk living with life-
altering consequences to our health, our economy, and national
security.
I have spoken with farmers in my district who have
experienced firsthand the impacts of climate change and who are
concerned about what it means for our agricultural community.
This past spring, Illinois saw historic flooding and other
extreme weather events brought on by climate change. With
Illinois rivers swelling beyond the flood stage and past record
peaks, farmers were not able to plant their crops until well
into the spring months.
After hearing the concerns of farmers in the 14th, I felt
compelled to protect USDA research data by introducing an
amendment to the fiscal 2020 Agriculture appropriations package
that would prevent Federal agencies like USDA from removing
existing public information about climate change.
Sadly, just weeks after my amendment was passed by the
House, new reports exposed the extent of the anti-climate
science sentiment at USDA. These reports indicated that USDA
leadership took steps to hide scientific findings on the
consequences of climate change and the impacts it will have on
farmers.
Undermining public discourse of climate change research
sets a dangerous precedent which can endanger our national
security, food security, and the livelihoods of Illinois
farmers and farmers throughout our country.
As you can see, climate change is a front-of-mind issue in
my district. And like many others across the country, they are
demanding real leadership on this issue from us, their elected
representatives. I came to Congress with a mandate from my
constituents, and I am committed to ensuring that Congress
upholds its responsibilities to communities like mine who are
demanding meaningful, long-term solutions to climate change.
We also need to talk about a broad-based approach to
climate change. I am excited about forthcoming legislation that
would put the United States on a path to have a 100 percent
clean economy by 2050.
I look forward to working with you, Chairwoman Castor, and
with other members on this committee to advance meaningful
legislation during this Congress.
And I yield back.

Testimony of the Hon. Lauren Underwood
A Representative in Congress from the State of Illinois
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you, Madam Chair, for providing this opportunity for Members
to share their priorities with the Select Committee on the Climate
Crisis.
The very existence of this Committee is a testament to the urgency
of this crisis and the House's commitment to tackling it head on.
I am grateful to come before the Committee today to bring attention
to the important need for Congressional action to address climate
change.
The science is clear: we are on an alarming path. Our climate is
changing, presenting an existential threat to our environment, our
national security, our health, and our economy.
As the country looks to its leaders to take federal action to
address climate change, I am proud to have supported H.R. 9, the
Climate Action Now Act, which is the first major climate legislation
passed by the House in nearly a decade.
I was honored to continue this effort when I introduced H.R. 3819,
the Climate and Health Protection Act, with my colleague and former
Secretary for Health and Human Services, Representative Donna Shalala
(D-FL).
As a public health nurse, I fully recognize the adverse impact
climate change will have on public health, particularly for the most
vulnerable people in our society-- pregnant women, children, the
elderly, and countless others.
My bill protects the Centers for Disease Control's Climate and
Health Program. This program is the only office within the Department
of Health and Human Services dedicated to helping state and local
governments prepare for the public health consequences of climate
change.
Secondly, my bill increases funding for the program to $15 million
which is consistent with the funding provided in the House's Fiscal
Year 2020 appropriations package.
Without the resources and services provided by the Climate and
Health Program, many communities across the country will be left
vulnerable and unaware of the devasting health consequences climate
change poses.
I appreciate the Committee on Energy and Commerce's oversight work
on this Administration's decision to limit the Climate and Health
Program. In addition to continuing that work, we must pass my Climate
and Health Protection Act to reinstate and protect this vital program.
It is an honor to represent the people of the 14th District of
Illinois, who know that it is long past time to take serious steps to
address climate change--or we risk living with life-altering
consequences to our health, economy, and national security.
I've spoken with farmers in my district who have experienced
firsthand the impacts of climate change and are concerned about what it
means for our agriculture community.
This past spring, Illinois saw historic flooding and other extreme
weather events brought on by climate change. With Illinois rivers
swelling beyond the flood stage and past record peaks, farmers were not
able to plant their crops until well into the spring months.
After hearing the concerns of farmers in the 14th District, I felt
compelled to protect USDA research data by introducing an amendment to
the FY 2020 Agriculture appropriations package that would prevent
federal agencies like USDA from removing existing public information
about climate change.
Sadly, just weeks after my amendment was passed by the House, new
reports exposed the extent of the anti-climate science sentiment at
USDA. These reports indicated that USDA leadership took steps to hide
scientific findings on the consequences of climate change and the
impacts it will have on farmers.
Undermining public disclosure of climate change research sets a
dangerous precedent, which can endanger our national security, food
security, and the livelihoods of Illinois farmers and farmers
throughout the country.
As you can see, climate change is a front of mind issue in my
district. And like many others across the country, they are demanding
real leadership on this issue from us--their elected representatives.
I came to Congress with a mandate from my constituents, and I am
committed to ensuring Congress upholds its responsibility to
communities like mine who are demanding meaningful, long-term solutions
to climate change.
We also need to talk about a broad-based approach to climate
change. I am excited about forthcoming legislation that would put the
United States on the path to have a 100% clean economy by 2050.
I look forward to working with you, Chairwoman Castor, and with
other members of this Committee to advance meaningful legislation
during this Congress.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you very much.
I know you are aware of what Harvard University and other
researchers released today about the impact of extreme
temperatures on children----
Ms. Underwood. That is right.
Ms. Castor [continuing]. Particularly on their public
health. So I think your expertise in this area is going to be
invaluable to the committee as we move forward. So thank you.
Are there any questions from the panel?
Thank you, Ms. Underwood.
Ms. Underwood. Thank you for your time.
Ms. Castor. So, Chairwoman McCollum, you have been a leader
for many years on these issues. You are welcome to provide your
testimony for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. BETTY McCOLLUM, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA
Ms. McCollum. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking
Member. Thank you for the opportunity to allow Members to
testify today.
As the chair of the Interior and Environment Appropriations
Subcommittee, I believe we have a shared responsibility to work
together for the American people to combat climate change and
reduce pollution, both through policy recommendations and
funding.
I would also like to thank the committee for giving young
climate leaders, policy specialists, business leaders, and
State and local officials the opportunity to provide input on
the climate crisis. I have heard firsthand in Minnesota how
excited they are to be able to participate in this way.
Climate change is real and is affecting people all over the
world, in every part of their lives. Recently, I was in Malawi
with the U.S. Forest Service and witnessed firsthand the
impacts of climate change in the southern part of Africa.
This is an issue that Congress cannot solve alone, nor can
one committee do it alone. Changing the course of the climate
crisis will require all of us to step up and take action. We
all know that climate change will have devastating effects on
economic inputs, from agriculture to healthcare to
infrastructure, and we need to be making the Federal
investments now to understand and address and adapt to climate
change.
That is why I am here today to talk about prioritizing
funding for climate change. Why? Because climate change is
dynamic and is impacting our lives all over this planet. This
is why the House invested in expanding climate research and
protecting our public lands and our natural resources. By doing
this, we will ensure that Americans will not only have clean
air and clean water today but for generations to come.
It is critical that the Federal agencies funded throughout
the Interior bill receive adequate support to carry out the
policies recommended by this committee. Our path forward will
also need to include investments throughout the Federal
Government. These investments will help to mitigate the worst
effects of climate change but also help communities to adapt to
the impacts we are already seeing, like rising sea levels and
the wildland fires that are so devastating in California.
As vice chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I
know that climate change is one of the most forefront national
security threats of our time. A report released in January from
the Pentagon laid out the stark reality we face from our
changing climate. Two-thirds of our military's operationally
essential installations are threatened by climate change. And
as the Department considers where to spend military
construction dollars or bases for our most valuable assets,
climate change must inform every decision that they are making.
Simply put, the cost of inaction on climate change is already
having a staggering impact on our national security.
In order to halt the acceleration as well as to adapt to
climate change, we need to fund and protect sound scientific
research within the Federal Government. It is no secret that
scientific research is constantly under attack from the Trump
administration. Under President Trump, for example, we have
seen the rules change to favor industry domination over EPA
scientific panels. We need to make smart decisions based on
science, not politics. As this administration continues to push
an anti-science agenda, Congress must do more to protect our
scientific institutions.
What is most important is that we know that these policies
that you are going to come up with come with a price tag. And I
believe every appropriations bill should include a line on what
agencies and departments need to do to combat climate change,
mitigate the effects that we are already seeing, and establish
resiliency.
And so that is my ask, Madam Chair. It is crucial that we
ensure that the Federal Government has the resources necessary
to carry out the work.
As chair of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I
will continue to prioritize to address climate change and
building resiliency into our fragile ecosystems, and restore
funding for our programs that have suffered deep cuts under
previous Congresses, and to conduct the oversight necessary to
hold the Trump administration and any other future
administration accountable for their climate change actions or
denials.
So, to the chair and the ranking member, I want to thank
you so much for the time. I look forward to working with you
together in the 116th Congress.
And, Madam Chair, with your permission, I would like to
enter in for the record and for you the ``Report on Effects of
a Changing Climate'' from the Department of Defense from
January 2019.

Testimony of the Hon. Betty McCollum
A Representative in Congress from the State of Minnesota
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Chair Castor, Ranking Member Graves thank you for providing the
opportunity for Members to testify today.
As Chair of the Interior and Environment Appropriations
Subcommittee, we have a shared responsibility to work together for the
American people to combat climate change and reduce pollution through
both policy recommendations and federal funding.
I would also like to thank the Committee for giving young climate
leaders, policy specialists, business leaders, and state and local
officials the opportunity to provide input on the climate crisis. I
have contacted many stakeholders in my district, and throughout
Minnesota, who are excited about the committee's invitation to submit
public statements.
Climate change is real and affecting people all over the world, in
every part of their lives. I recently was in Malawi with the U.S.
Forest service and witnessed firsthand the varying impacts of climate
change around the globe. This is an issue which Congress cannot solve
with one Committee alone. Changing the course of the climate crisis
will require all of us to step up and take action. We know that climate
change will have devastating economic impacts from agriculture to
healthcare to infrastructure. We need to be making federal investments
now to understand, address, and adapt to climate change.
We must prioritize funding for climate change. Why? Because climate
change is dynamic in all the ways it impacts our planet. That's why the
House invested in expanding climate research and protecting our public
lands and natural resources. By doing this, we will ensure that
Americans will have clean water and air not only today but for

Our path forward will also need to include investments throughout
the federal government. These investments will help to mitigate the
worst effects of climate change, but also help communities to adapt to
impacts we are already seeing like rising sea levels and the
devastating wildfires in California.
As Vice Chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I know
that Climate change is one of the foremost national security threats of
our time. A report released in January from the Pentagon laid out the
stark reality they face from our changing climate. Two-thirds of our

climate change. As the Department considers where to spend military
construction dollars or base our most valuable defense assets, climate
change must inform every decision they make. Simply put, the cost of
inaction on climate change has already had a staggering impact on our
national security.
In order to effectively slow and adapt to climate change, we need
to fund and protect sound scientific research within the federal
government. It is no secret that scientific research is constantly
under attack from the Trump Administration.
Under President Trump, for example, we have seen the rules change
to favor industry domination on EPA's scientific panels. We need to
make smart decisions that are based on science, not politics. As this
Administration continues to push an anti-science agenda, congress must
do more to protect our scientific institutions.
I look forward to working with this Committee and the authorizing
committees on legislation that protects government scientists and
invests in research. Scientific integrity is vital to address the
serious challenges climate change poses to our natural and cultural
resources, ecosystems, and human health.
Action on climate change is at a critical crossroads. The purpose
of this Committee is to develop policies that will provide us the best
chance at saving our planet for future generations. But it is important
to note that these policies come with a price tag. I believe every
Appropriations Bill should include a line item on what agencies and
departments need to do to combat climate change, mitigate the effects
we are already seeing, and establish resiliency. It is crucial we
ensure the federal government has the resources necessary to carry out
that work. As Chair of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, I will
continue to prioritize funding to address climate change and build
resiliency in our fragile ecosystems, restore funding for programs that
have suffered deep cuts in previous Congresses, and conduct the
oversight necessary to hold the Trump administration accountable for
their climate denial.
Chair Castor, I thank you for the time, and I look forward to
working as the 116th Congress moved forward.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Chairwoman McCollum.
Your leadership on the Interior Subcommittee of
Appropriations and the entire Appropriations Committee will be
invaluable going forward. Already, the appropriations bill
passed this term by the House is very impactful when it comes
to climate policies, and I thank you. And I heard you loud and
clear on your recommendation that every appropriations bill
from this point forward should have some sort of analysis going
forward for agencies.
And thank you, as well, for your attention to our military
installations and to make sure that they are resilient and we
are able to address these issues going forward.
Mr. Casten, do have you any questions or comments?
Mr. Griffith.
Mr. Griffith. No.
Ms. Castor. Thank you, Chairwoman McCollum.
Speaking of defense experts and champions, Mrs. Davis, you
are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. SUSAN DAVIS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Mrs. Davis of California. Thank you very much, Chairwoman
Castor, Ranking Member Griffith, and members of the select
committee. It is a pleasure to join you today and discuss what
we know is the biggest challenge of our time, climate change.
I am glad the select committee is meeting today to take
testimony on this very important issue and pleased to be part
of the conversation. After successful passage of H.R. 9, the
Climate Action Now Act, I am looking forward to what the select
committee will develop with multiple levels of input, and I
appreciate the fact that you are doing that.
As we have seen, there is no simple solution. Not only do
we have to consider how we mitigate the impacts of climate
change, we also have to come up with a plan to adapt to future
changes. How do we create a sustainable commitment to reduce
carbon emissions and plan for the future?
One place I have looked is my hometown of San Diego. San
Diego enacted its own climate action plan to eliminate half of
all greenhouse gas emissions in the city by 2035 and develop an
adaptation and resiliency plan for future impacts. The plan
includes a number of policies, but I am just going to focus on
two areas, which are transportation and developing resiliency
plans.
And I might mention, Madam Chair, you mentioned our
military. On many levels, they have taken the lead in San
Diego, working with their bases and with other communities. But
I am going to put that aside right now and just talk about what
the city of San Diego has done.
Transportation is the largest source of emissions in the
United States, accounting for 29 percent of manmade greenhouse
gas emissions in the United States. To address this, we will
need more fuel-efficient vehicles, of course, more alternative
fuels with less carbon content, and we will simply have to
drive less.
As automakers develop more economical electric and
alternative-fuel vehicles, we will need to ensure that we have
the infrastructure available to accommodate them. Research
shows that electric vehicles lack adequate infrastructure
despite surging demand in recent years, and we must fix that.
Beyond infrastructure, the Federal Government must play a
major role in promoting cleaner modes of transportation. In San
Diego, for example, the city's climate action plan includes
changing policy to have a majority of the city's fleet be
electric vehicles. Similarly, we should move forward with the
transition of vehicle fleets of Federal agencies to electric
vehicles, hybrid-electric vehicles, or alternative-fuel
vehicles.
According to the Government Services Administration, what
we know as GSA, the Federal Government owns or leases over
640,000 vehicles across all agencies, at a cost of $814 million
in fuel costs in a single year. With a proper transition plan
and achievable benchmarks, this is one area where we could
certainly help reduce our carbon footprint.
Last, we should make matching funds available for
communities that want to build infrastructure for bicycling and
public transport. This would certainly reduce how much time we
spend in our vehicles.
As I mentioned earlier, we will also have to think
critically about developing resiliency plans. Many parts of the
country are already seeing the effects of climate change--
record-breaking fires in California, historic floods in the
Midwest, and hurricanes along the East Coast. These events, as
we know, are becoming more frequent and more intense. And yet
we continue to build and rebuild in areas that are prone to
climate-change-related hazards. We see it every year in
California and across the country.
But we don't have to wait for disasters to develop a
resilience plan. We need to improve building codes and land-use
practices and consider the future impact of climate change
rather than relying solely on the historical record. We also
need to include the development of resilience in building
plans, build more resilient infrastructure, and work towards
restricting sprawl and increasing density.
San Diego is currently in the process of developing a
climate resiliency plan to address climate-change-related
vulnerabilities across our city and look at developing
adaptation measures to improve the city's resilience to climate
hazards.
It is time. It is time that we do that, too, as a Nation.
We must look at how we build that resilience. Because more
disasters are sure to come, and they will be costly. We are
currently appropriating hundreds of millions of dollars to
rebuild after each hundred-year storm or record-breaking
wildfire. We should consider making funds for repairs and
reconstruction after disasters contingent on the development of
adaptation and resiliency plans. It is an important message to
send to our communities.
Ultimately, Congress must play a role in making more
resilient cities a reality by building on existing legislation.
I would like to thank you again for giving me the
opportunity to be part of this important conversation. Thank
you.

NEED TO ACT ON CLIMATE CHANGE

Ms. Castor. Thank you, Representative Davis, for your
insightful testimony, particularly about the leadership efforts
from San Diego.
Any questions from the members?
Thank you.
Ms. Castor. Welcome, Congresswoman Barragan. I know, as my
colleague from the Energy and Commerce Committee, you have been
a leader when it comes to clean energy. You are recognized for
5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. NANETTE BARRAGAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Ms. Barragan. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman and the ranking
member and members of the committee, for the opportunity to
testify here today in front of the select committee.
From sea-level rise to the location of power plants, to
fossil-fuel extraction, to the urban heat-island effect, the
inequities from our energy system and who bears its
consequences are everywhere. People of color are on the front
lines of this issue. We are hit first and worst. We need a
climate bill that rises to the scale of both the climate crisis
and the damage from environmental racism that impacts my
district and the districts like it across the country.
The best way for us to understand these challenges and how
to overcome them is to meet environmental justice communities
where they are. Not everyone can make it here to Washington,
D.C., for a hearing or a meeting with their Representative. I
appreciate that the select committee has conducted a field
hearing in Boulder, Colorado, on local and State solutions,
and, going forward, I want to encourage to you prioritize field
hearings in EJ communities.
In particular, I have a couple of ideas for field hearings
in my very district, in south Los Angeles, that could both
illuminate our local challenges and provide useful information
for Federal climate policy that can address these kinds of
issues across the country.
One possibility is to hold a field hearing with the Port of
Los Angeles and community environmental leaders in my district.
We have one of the most ambitious ports in the country when it
comes to reducing emissions. At the same time, the port is a
significant source of air and climate pollution. And
environmental groups in my district have strong views on the
best paths forward for the port to achieve zero emissions as
quickly as possible.
These are challenges that face ports throughout the
country, so we could apply what is learned there to different
parts of the country and incorporate it into any legislation.
An additional possibility is a hearing on a just transition
away from fossil fuels and what it means for communities like
mine. We deal with pollution from oil refineries and ongoing
urban oil drilling right in people's backyards, which has a
direct impact on the quality of the air we breathe. At the same
time that the fossil-fuel industry has a disproportionate
footprint in minority communities and those that are low-
income, these industries often provide jobs, including union
jobs, to my constituents. As we work to unwind the fossil-fuel
economy, we need insights on how to provide for a just
transition for workers in the fossil-fuel industry.
I would welcome the opportunity to work with the select
committee on these and other ideas for a field hearing in my
district as part of the process for crafting climate solutions
that leave no community behind.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today.

From sea level rise, to the location of power plants, to fossil

You are absolutely right. We have to ensure, as we are
developing policies to tackle the climate crisis going forward,
that we do not leave folks on the front lines behind and that
environmental justice policies are incorporated in everything
that we recommend to the congressional committees. And I think
the committee would look forward to a trip to your district and
to examine these issues.
Mr. Griffith, do have you any questions?
Mr. Griffith. I do have a comment. I also agree that we
need to make sure we don't leave communities behind.
I represent a coal-producing district. And, you know, if we
are going to reinvent the economy, as people often suggest to
us, we are going to need road money and we are going to need
other moneys to help us reinvent an economy that for over a
hundred years has been reliant exclusively or predominantly on
coal. And I appreciate your comments on that.

ranking member, and members of the committee, for allowing me
to testify before you today.
I am here to urge you to support two bills I have
introduced: H. R. 330, the Climate Solutions Act; and H. R.
2360, the Renewable Energy for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands Act.
I believe that climate change is the greatest existential
threat to humankind. In recent years, the dangers of climate
change have become increasingly clear. According to the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the last 5
years have been the hottest on record, with July 2019 being the
hottest month in recorded history.
These records have severe consequences. In 2018, the U.S.
experienced several major weather disasters, resulting in 245
lives lost and $91 billion of damages. And we can see the
climate crisis unfolding before our very eyes in districts we
all represent. Last year, wildfires, including the Woolsey Fire
in my congressional district, tore through California, making
it the most destructive fire season on record. This year, we
saw additional fires in my district, including the Palisades
Fire and the Getty Fire. At the same time, communities
throughout the country are dealing with hurricanes, flooding,
and other extreme weather events.
That is why I introduced the Climate Solutions Act. When I
was in the California State legislature, I was a co-author of
AB 32, California's landmark Global Warming Solutions Act. The
reason that I thought that law did well was we didn't set out
and say, hey, here are 951 things we want you to do to mitigate
climate change. Instead, we set a goal, and then we directed an
agency to get us to that goal and gave that agency the power to
take us there. So we set a goal of pre-1990 levels of
greenhouse gases by 2020, and we gave the California Air
Resources Board the power to take us there. My legislation is
similar. It sets goals, and then it directs the EPA and the
Department of Energy to take us there.
And so, first, the bill sets out a national renewable
energy standard to drive us towards 100-percent renewable
energy by 2035. Next, it creates a stringent national energy
efficiency standard to reduce energy usage and to save
consumers money. And, finally, the legislation sets ambitious
greenhouse-gas emission targets to reduce emissions to 80
percent below 1990 levels by 2050.
The proposal has nearly two dozen Members of Congress who
have co-sponsored it, and I respectfully request that you
consider it as well.
And the second bill I would like to talk about is the
Renewable Energy for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
Act.
We know that two hurricanes struck Puerto Rico, Maria and
Irma, as well as the U.S. Virgin Islands, cutting off access to
power for most communities on the island. Without electricity,
critical sites such as hospitals and wastewater treatment
plants became inoperable, local businesses closed, and
performing regular tasks became nearly impossible.
It remains clear that we have a unique and necessary
opportunity to empower local communities in Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands to build up renewable energy systems that
would remain operable after storms.
Under this act, the legislation would establish a program
at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to award grants to not-
for-profit organizations for the purposes of developing
renewable energy systems in local communities. The funds may
also be used to improve energy efficiency and battery storage
and to train local residents.
And, finally, the bill will require the Government
Accountability Office to conduct a study on renewable energy
and energy efficiency in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin
Islands.
This proposal has the support of Representative Gonzalez-
Colon of Puerto Rico, Representative Stacey Plaskett of the
U.S. Virgin Islands, and Representative Raul Grijalva, the
chairman of the Natural Resources Committee. And I respectfully
request that you consider this legislation as well.
Again, thank you for having me here, and look forward to
working with you as we tackle the issue of climate change.

Testimony of the Hon. Ted W. Lieu
A Representative in Congress from the State of California
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Chairwoman Castor and Ranking Member Graves, thank you for allowing
me to testify. Today, I am here to urge you to support two bills I have
introduced: H.R. 330, the Climate Solutions Act and H.R. 2360, the
Renewable Energy for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands Act.
I believe that climate change is the greatest existential threat to
humankind. In recent years, the dangers of climate change--and the need
to address it--have become increasingly clear. According to the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the last five years
have been the five hottest on record with July 2019 being the hottest
month in recorded history. These records have severe consequences. In
2018, the U.S. experienced several major weather disasters resulting in
247 lives lost and $91 billion in damages.
Beyond these numbers, we can see the climate crisis unfolding
before our eyes. Last year, wildfires, including the Woolsey Fire in my
congressional district, tore through California making it the most
destructive fire season on record. This year, we've seen similar
apocalyptic images of fires in the West. At the same time, communities
throughout the country are dealing with hurricanes, flooding, and other
extreme weather events.
H.R. 330, The Climate Solutions Act
Last October, the International Panel on Climate Change found that
limiting temperature increases to 1.5 +C above pre-industrial levels by
the end of the century requires a decrease in carbon emissions to 45
percent below 2010 levels by 2030. The urgency of these numbers demands
bold action from Congress. That is why I introduced a strengthened
Climate Solutions Act to comprehensively address the climate crisis.
First, the bill sets out a National Renewable Energy Standard to drive
us towards 100 percent renewable energy by 2035. Next, it creates a
stringent National Energy Efficiency Standard to reduce energy usage
and save consumers money. Finally, my legislation sets ambitious
greenhouse gas emissions targets to reduce emissions to 80 percent
below 1990 levels by 2050. This proposal has the support of nearly two
dozen of our colleagues in Congress and I'd ask you to support it.
H.R. 2360, Renewable Energy for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
Act
In 2017, Hurricanes Maria and Irma struck Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands cutting off access to power for most communities on the
island. Without electricity, critical sites such as hospitals and
wastewater treatment plants became inoperable, local businesses closed,
and performing regular tasks became nearly impossible. It remains clear
that we have a unique and necessary opportunity to empower local
communities in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to build up
renewable energy systems that will remain operable after storms.
That is why I introduced the Renewable Energy for Puerto Rico and
the U.S. Virgin Islands Act. This legislation will establish a program
at the U.S. Department of Agriculture to award grants to not-for-profit
organizations for the purposes of developing renewable energy systems
in local communities. The funds may also be used to improve energy
efficiency and battery storage and to train local residents. Finally,
the bill will require the General Accountability Office to conduct a
study on renewable energy and energy efficiency in Puerto Rico and the
U.S. Virgin Islands. This proposal has the support of Representative
Gonzalez-Colon of Puerto Rico, Representative Stacey Plaskett of the
U.S. Virgin Islands, and Representative Raul Grijalva, the Chairman of
the Natural Resources Committee.
Conclusion
H.R. 330 and H.R. 2360 will prove critical to reducing greenhouse
gas emissions to address the climate crisis and help communities
devastated by extreme weather events build back in a more resilient
manner. I urge you to include these bills in your final report to the
standing committees.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify before you.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Lieu.
The committee does intend to delve into lessons learned
from climate action in California, so your insight and your
legislation will be very helpful as we move forward. So thank
you very much.
Mr. Lieu. Thank you.
Ms. Castor. I have, just so you know, on my--oh, Mr.
Casten, you are recognized.
Mr. Casten. So, number one, I want to absolutely echo your
point that we need to be goal- rather than path-focused. I
think all of our best environmental regulations followed that.
A question for you to consider and maybe submit comments
afterwards, if you can, is: In thinking about places like
California that have been well ahead of the Federal Government,
how can we roll out Federal policy that is maximally
synergistic with what has been done in the States? Maybe push
them to do more, but we are going to be rolling out these
policies in the context of AB 32 and RGGI and all these other
programs, and I think we need to put some thought into how to
make sure that those fit with those existing State programs.
I welcome your thoughts.
Mr. Lieu. Yes. So thank you for that question. We need to
make sure we don't preempt States that have gone further and
have innovated. At the same time, there are a lot of States
that have done virtually nothing. And so we do need to bring up
all of the States to an area where we are dealing with tackling
climate change.
One of the reasons I ran for Congress, it was clear to me
that California could go dark tomorrow, do no energy use
whatsoever, and it wouldn't change many things. Because what we
need is the rest of America to do what California has done and
then the rest of the world to do what America will do, and then
we have a shot at combating climate change.
So we need to make sure we don't preempt what States have
already been doing but still set standards that will make a
difference.
Thank you.
Ms. Castor. Thank you very much.
Mr. Lieu. Thank you.
Ms. Castor. All right. Congresswoman Bustos, you have been
very outspoken particularly when it comes to solutions in
agriculture. We look forward to hearing your testimony. You are
recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. CHERI BUSTOS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
Mrs. Bustos. All right, very good. Thank you, Chairwoman
Castor, for your leadership on this, and certainly appreciate
the opportunity to be in front of the Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis.
This is literally what I see as one of the most complicated
challenges that our Nation and our world are facing today. As
the national and global conversation continues, I want to be
sure to bring the perspective of the region that I represent,
the center of the country, and the solutions that we think we
can bring forth to help address the climate debate.
So I want to give you a little bit of background on the
district I serve first. Seven thousand square miles. Covers the
entire northwest corner of the State of Illinois. Sixty percent
of the towns in the congressional district I serve are 1,000
people or fewer. Eighty-five percent of the towns are 5,000
people or fewer. We have 9,600 farms. And the entire western
border is the biggest inland navigable waterway in the world,
the Mississippi River.
So, this past spring, we saw up close and personal what the
climate crisis means, especially to our family farmers. We had
historic flooding, where the Illinois River and the Mississippi
River didn't just rise once but would go down and would rise
again, and just historic flooding, where our growers and our
producers literally had to apply in record numbers for what is
called ``prevent plant'' because they couldn't even plant their
soybean fields and their cornfields because of the massive
flooding that we were experiencing.
So we wanted to make sure that we produced something to
this committee that would show that we want to be part of the
solution, in the middle part of our country. We want to have a
seat at the table, and we want to make sure there is an
understanding of what we are facing. So this is a matter of
saying that rural America, we have some answers.
And what we have done is we put together a proposal that we
call the--gosh, it is pretty bad that I don't have that right
in front of me--the Rural Green Partnership. The Rural Green
Partnership. So it is a set of policies that work with Federal,
local, and State governments, producers, businesses, labor
organizations, other stakeholders, to lower the greenhouse
emissions and really look at every economic sector of rural
America.
So, with each of these policies, it is designed to
basically lift up our region and empower the enormous potential
that we see in rural America. So just a few examples that I
wanted to share with you this afternoon.
So we look at things like sequester carbon and soils,
vegetation, forests; grow and produce biofuels in renewable
products; capture carbon dioxide and store it deep underground,
where it can be put for beneficial use; the building of wind
farms and solar fields on a large scale, because we have so
much open land; and employ the wealth of technical training
schools, community colleges, Tribal colleges, land grant and
other universities; work with organized labor, apprenticeship
programs, research facilities, and prepare our workforces to
create thousands of good-paying jobs and boost our local
economies.
So we see this as tackling the climate crisis as a moral
and economic imperative. And I hope that your special committee
will take a look at this and make sure that rural America has a
seat at the table and sees us as part of the solution.
I want to thank you for the opportunity to be here with you
today. And I know we have a little bit more time. I am happy to
answer any questions about this, if have you any.

Testimony of the Hon. Cheryl ``Cheri'' Bustos
A Representative in Congress from the State of Illinois
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you, Chairwoman Castor and Ranking Member Graves for giving
me the opportunity to share my policy recommendations for addressing
the climate crisis.
Climate change may very well be the most complicated challenge our
nation, and the world, has ever faced.
As the national and global conversation continues, I want to be
sure to bring the perspective of the region I represent--the center of
the country--and what we can offer to the climate change debate.
Illinois' 17th Congressional District spans 7,000 square miles.
85% of the towns in my district are 5,000 people or fewer, and 60%
are 1,000 people or fewer. There are 9,600 family farms, and along the
western border is the largest navigable inland waterway in the world--
the Mississippi River.
And this past spring, my district experienced the effects of
climate change firsthand. From historic flooding to unpredictable
weather, the growers and producers in my district struggled to plant,
grow and harvest their crops.
But it is more than just our farmers, these challenges impact every
aspect of my region.
Witnessing this, I decided to submit the Rural Green Partnership to
this Committee. The Rural Green Partnership is a framework of
principles and policies to both combat climate change and spur economic
growth.
It brings rural America to the table of the climate debate, a
conversation that we've too often been left out of--or worse--simply
blamed for.
Specifically, it details a set of policies that work with federal,
local and state governments, producers, businesses, unions, non-
governmental organizations and other stakeholders to lower greenhouse
gas emissions in every economic sector of rural America.
And each of these policies is designed to bring to the table what
our region of the country offers. It truly empowers and lifts up the
enormous potential of rural America.
Because rural America can . . .
Sequester carbon in soils, vegetation and forests
Grow and produce biofuels and renewable products
Capture carbon dioxide and store it deep underground
or put it to beneficial use
Build wind farms and solar fields on a large scale
And employ its wealth of technical training schools,
community colleges, tribal colleges, land grant and other
universities, union registered apprenticeship programs and
research facilities to prepare our workforce, create thousands
of good-paying jobs and boost our local economies.
Tackling the climate crisis is both a moral and economic
imperative. I urge my colleagues to make sure rural America is included
in any conversation about our path forward.
Thank you for this opportunity, and I yield back the remainder of
my time.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Congresswoman Bustos.
You know, since you released your Rural Green Partnership
policy proposals, it has been quite interesting, because I have
seen a lot of folks in the ag industry and from rural America
kind of rallying around these type of ecosystem solutions,
solutions for the land--as you highlighted, sequestering
carbon.
What we need now, we need to hear from a lot of those
experts as we develop the policy proposals, put a little more
meat on the bones. A lot of the land grant universities are
ready to step up and help. So help us spread the word through
our request for proposal that is out on the street to use your
leadership position now to tap that expertise across rural
America to help us develop those kind of solutions.
Mrs. Bustos. Well, we are happy to help you with that in
any way possible, and really appreciate the opportunity to
present this to you today. Thank you, Chairwoman.
Ms. Castor. Thank you very much. Terrific.
Next is the co-founder of the Climate Solutions Caucus,
also the co-chair. I want to thank my colleague from Florida,
Congressman Ted Deutch, for his leadership on climate change
throughout his career.
Congressman, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. TED DEUTCH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA
Mr. Deutch. Thank you, Chairwoman Castor, Mr. Griffith. It
is wonderful to be here. Thanks for holding this Member Day.
Imagine walking outside to a beautiful, sunny south Florida
day, the sort of weather that attracts visitors to the Sunshine
State. It is the backbone of our economy. Imagine strolling
down Las Olas Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale under cloudless
skies--and yet standing in water up to your ankles. Rising seas
make sunny-day flooding a regular occurrence in south Florida.
The South Florida Sun-Sentinel labeled October's annual king
tides the time of year when fish swim in the streets.
For my constituents, climate change is already a part of
their daily lives. Americans around the country are
experiencing their own climate impacts today. Rushing flood
waters, stronger storms, brutal droughts, sprawling wildfires
won't discriminate between Republican or Democratic households.
These impacts inspired me and Congressman Francis Rooney to
introduce the bipartisan Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend
Act. That is H.R. 763.
Our proposal would finally put a price on carbon. For too
long, damaging carbon emissions have been left off the balance
sheets of the world's largest polluters. Instead, we are all
paying the price. That is why we need a market-driven solution
that will get us to zero emissions.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund called carbon
pricing the single most powerful and efficient tool to reduce
emissions. The IMF called for a $75-per-ton fee by 2030. Our
bill gets there by 2026. We start at a modest $15 per ton
assessed on fossil fuels at the source--at refineries, at
mines, and pipelines. But the price quickly ratchets up, $10
per year.
Putting a price on carbon will send a bright signal across
the economy that it is time to switch to a clean-energy
economy. It will drive clean-power innovations that make
business sense as much as they make climate sense.
The big question is, where does the money go? One hundred
percent goes back to the American people as a monthly dividend
check. We have seen what happens when carbon fees hit consumers
directly and the revenue is then used for purposes other than
directly helping consumers: It doesn't work, and it penalizes
the most vulnerable. Monthly dividends will allow families to
afford renewable energy as an alternative to carbon-based
fuels.
Last month, Columbia University's Center on Global Energy
Policy released an in-depth report on our bill. And I would ask
unanimous consent to submit for the record an assessment of the
Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act.
Ms. Castor. Without objection.

Submission for the Record
Representative Kathy Castor
Select Committee on the Climate Crisis
November 14, 2019
ATTACHMENT: Kaufman, Larsen, et al. An Assessment of the Energy
Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. Columbia University Center on
Global Energy Policy, 2019.
This report is retained in the committee files and available at:
https://energypolicy.columbia.edu/sites/default/files/file-uploads/
EICDA_CGEP-Report.pdf.
Mr. Deutch. The report found that our bill will produce
economy-wide net greenhouse gas emission reductions of 38
percent by 2030, exceeding our Paris Agreement commitments; by
2050, 90 percent reductions. It would also create over 2
million net jobs over 10 years and will return monthly checks
of as much as $367 per month to a family of four.
Returning the cost of pollution back to American families
is essential. We need a drastic turn away from hundreds of
years of unchecked carbon pollution toward a carbon-free
economy. But we must root this dramatic change in justice.
Justice means those who have profited off the destruction of
our environment pay the price. Justice means protecting people
who have been locked into a carbon-heavy lifestyle through no
fault of their own.
And the balance of market-driven solutions and protection
for the most vulnerable is why this bill has the support of
advocates from across the ideological spectrum, from Citizens'
Climate Lobby, to the Alliance for Market Solutions, to the
Catholic Bishops of America and other faith-based
organizations. I ask that this committee respond to their call
by recommending that the Ways and Means Committee fully
consider this bill.
It is important to set goals and targets, but we need to do
something to get us there. This bill can do exactly that. It is
time to stop passing the cost for carbon pollution on to the
next generation. It is time to pull the levers in our economy
to deliver real and lasting change. It is time to put a price
on carbon. The Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act will
do that. The stakes could not be any higher, and we must act
now.
Again, Madam Chairman, I am so grateful for the opportunity
today. Thank you for giving us the chance to present.

Testimony of the Hon. Theodore ``Ted'' Deutch
A Representative in Congress from the State of Florida
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you, Chairwoman Castor and Ranking Member Graves.
Imagine walking outside to a beautiful, sunny South Florida day.
The sort of weather that attracts tourists to the Sunshine State
and is the backbone of our economy.
Imagine strolling down Las Olas Boulevard in Fort Lauderdale under
cloudless skies, and yet, you are in standing water up to your ankles.
Sunny-day flooding events are now a regular occurrence in South
Florida because of rising seas.
October's ``king tides'' are the time of the year when, according
to the South Florida Sun Sentinel, ``fish swim in the streets.''.
For my constituents, climate change is already a part of their
daily reality.
Americans around the country are already experiencing their own
climate impacts--TODAY.
Rushing flood waters, stronger storms, brutal droughts, and
sprawling wildfires won't discriminate between Republican or Democratic
households.
The climate impacts we are already feeling today inspired us to
introduce the bipartisan ``Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act''.
Our proposal would finally put a price on carbon.
For too long, the damage by carbon emissions to our planet have
been left off the balance sheets of the world's largest polluters.
Instead, we are ALL paying the price.
That's why we need a market-driven solution that will get us to
zero emissions.
Last month, the International Monetary Fund released a report
calling carbon pricing the ``single, most powerful and efficient tool''
to reduce emissions.
The IMF report calls for a global fee on carbon of $75 per ton by
the year 2030. Our bill gets there by 2026.
We start at a modest $15 per ton of carbon assessed at the source--
on the fossil fuel companies.
But the price quickly ratchets up $10 per year.
By putting a price on carbon, we will set a bright signal across
the economy that it is time to switch to cleaner energy sources.
It will drive new clean power innovations that make business-sense
as much as they make climate-sense.
The big question: where does the money go?
100 percent of the net revenue will be returned to the American
people as a monthly dividend check.
We've seen in cases around the world what happens when carbon fees
try to hit consumers directly, or the revenue is used for purposes
other than to directly help consumers.
It doesn't work, and it penalizes the most vulnerable.
By returning a carbon dividend check directly to the people,
working families will be in a financial position to afford renewable
energy as they become an attractive alternative to carbon-based fuels.
Last month, Columbia University Center on Global Energy Policy
released an in-depth report on the bill.
The report found that our bill would:
Lead to economy-wide net greenhouse gas emission reductions of 33%
by 2025 and 38% by 2030----
These reductions exceed our commitments to the Paris Agreement.
By 2050, our plan would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 90 percent.
Other studies have found that our fee and dividend proposal would
create over 2 million net jobs over ten years.
I want to thank the broad base of support we have received on this
proposal from stakeholders across the ideological spectrum.
But I especially want to thank the bipartisan advocates from
Citizens Climate Lobby.
CCL advocates take time out of their lives to come to Congress to
meet with their representatives and urge bold action on climate.
They have been instrumental in the progress we have made on this
bill.
I urge the committee to closely examine this proposal.
It is time to stop passing the costs for carbon pollution on to the
next generation.
It is time to pull the levers within our economy that will deliver
real and lasting change.
It is time to put a price on carbon.
This committee is charged with investigating, studying, and
developing recommendations to substantially and permanently alleviate
the causes of climate change.
I urge you in the strongest terms to press this Congress to make a
carbon fee and dividend program part of your important work----
Work that is of existential importance to our planet.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you to my good friend from Florida,
Congressman Deutch.
You know, you mentioned the flooding there in downtown Fort
Lauderdale.
And if you haven't been to Fort Lauderdale, it is a
beautiful place. It is known as the Venice of the United
States.
Well, you don't want to be the Venice of the United States,
because Venice, Italy, right now is completely flooded over.
But my brother-in-law, the one day of the terrible flooding
there, sent me some video where the flooding now was coming
over onto sidewalks, into the street. They had a lot of those
little scooters there practically washed away into the canal.
If we don't get busy, this is going to get worse. So I
really appreciate your leadership on this. The committee will
be grappling with how we price carbon and what our
recommendations are, so thank you for your advice to the
committee.
Mr. Deutch. Thanks so much.
Ms. Castor. Mr. Reed, you are the co-chair the Problem
Solvers Caucus, and we have a problem, and it is called the
climate crisis. So I hope you have some good recommendations
for the committee.
Mr. Reed. Well, I hope I do, Madam Chair.
Ms. Castor. You are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. TOM REED, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK
Mr. Reed. It is good to be with you. And to the ranking
member, I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you on
this Select Committee on the Climate Crisis.
And as the chair of the Problem Solvers Caucus, I would
agree with you; this is a problem that needs a solution. And I
think working together is how we are going to get this done,
Democrats, Republicans, and fundamentally as American citizens,
as citizens of the world.
I am here to discuss the Energy Sector Innovation Credit
Act as an idea as part of the solution to this issue as we work
in a bipartisan way to ensure future generations have clean air
to breathe, clean water to drink, and an overall healthy home
we call Earth.
Energy innovation is not a subject that I am new to or that
I take lightly. In my career, I have worked to demonstrate a
commitment to provide tax credits in the alternative and
renewable energy sector. This is best reflected by my receiving
the Solar Energy Industries Association's Solar Champion Award
in 2016 for my work in the Ways and Means Committee to ensure
relevant tax credits to that industry did not expire.
However, I have come to realize that not only should these
specific tax policies be championed in their own right but we
must also unleash the strongest asset we have to deal with this
worldwide problem of climate: the power of American ingenuity
and innovation. It is this unique American capability that has
proven time and time again that it can avert world crises. And
this situation is and will be, in my humble opinion, no
different.
It is in this vein that I will introduce legislation to
offer a tax incentive for new energy technologies which would
increase overall energy on the grid and ensure unneeded energy
is not financially rewarded so it will not be unnecessarily
produced. This will help cutting-edge technologies break into
the market to push new and old energy portfolios to provide
next-generation clean and potentially unlimited energy sources.
How would it work? By spurring innovation in the market
through these tax incentives, we can ensure a clean environment
for future generations, rather than producing policies that
line the pockets of established technologies and prop up
otherwise uneconomical and ultimately unaffordable
technologies.
This plan would lead to cleaner power without the false
security created by government mandates that cannot be
technologically achieved or a noncompetitive over-reliance on
Federal tax credits that ultimately will stifle energy
technologies becoming accessible in the world market. If these
technologies are not affordable and accessible, any improvement
or benefit to our environment here in America and across the
globe will be impossible.
Instead of picking winners and losers in the energy sector,
this new tax credit would bolster market-driven innovation
across all existing and new electricity-generating
technologies. This means everything from new power plants that
can capture, store, or use carbon emissions from fossil-fuel
generation to facilities using next-generation batteries to
store excess power from wind, solar, and other renewable
sources will be encouraged. Offshore wind would become
commercially viable.
And these technologies are just the beginning. There are
technologies and innovation that this would spur that we can't
even envision because of the ingenuity and the innovation
spirit of America that always comes through in these times of
our greatest needs.
So I stand before you, or I sit before you, Madam Chair, as
a bipartisan Member of the House supporting this proposal,
because I think Members on both sides of the aisle know and
recognize that innovation is a critical key in the long-term
viable solution to combating climate change and ensuring that
we have a home here on this great globe in a safe and secure
fashion for generations to come.
And so, Madam Chair, I submit that to the committee for
consideration. And I encourage any folks on both sides of the
aisle to come together to embrace American innovation, American
ingenuity, and provide the solutions that are going to truly
move the needle to solve this problem for our kids and for our
grand-kids that don't even exist on the face of the Earth as of
today.
With that, I yield back.

A Representative in Congress from the State of New York
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Madam Chair, I am appearing before the Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis to discuss the Energy Sector Innovation Credit Act, as
we work in a bipartisan way to ensure future generations have clean air
to breath in and clean water to drink.
For decades, Congress has routinely acted on a bipartisan basis to
extend a number of expired or expiring green energy tax provisions.
Typically, these extensions would be bundled into a part of a larger
spending package or budget deal at the end of the year--oftentimes
hurriedly or haphazardly with little thought of whether the industry
receiving the tax break was deserving.
I have even pushed for these tax credits in the green energy
sector, and I received the Solar Energy Industries Association Solar
Champion Award in 2016 for my work in the Ways and Means Committee to
ensure solar tax credits did not expire.
However, what I have come to realize is that we hand out these tax
extenders with little regard if the industry is using this incentive to
boost profits or to actually advance green technology.
This is why I will introduce legislation to offer a tax incentive
for new clean energy technologies which would increase energy on the
grid, ensure unneeded energy is not financially rewarded, help cutting-
edge technologies break into the market and upend the status quo of
federal incentives for existing technologies.
How would it work?
The plan ends unlimited, market-distorting extenders for tax
incentives and has a built-in ramp down for each technology as it
grows. By spurring innovation in the market, we can ensure a clean
environment for future generations rather than lining the pockets of
established technologies and propping up otherwise uneconomical
technologies.
Instead of picking winners and losers in the energy sector, this
new tax credit would bolster market-driven innovation across
electricity-generating technologies. This means everything from a new
power plant which can capture, store or use carbon emissions from
fossil fuel generation to facilities using next-generation batteries to
store excess power from wind, solar and other renewable sources.
This plan would lead to cleaner power without government mandates
or an uncompetitive over-reliance on federal tax credits.
The current market rewards energy whether it is used or not. My
bill ensures incentives apply to the value of energy when sold so we do
not reward unwanted power.
Both the Republicans on the Ways and Means Committee and bipartisan
members of the House are supporting this proposal--not only to help
bring an end to the tax extender carousel--but because they know
innovation is the only viable long term solution to combat climate
change and ensure clean air and water for future generations.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Mr. Reed, for your remarks and
your encouragement. I do believe that this committee will find
bipartisan solutions and help unleash American ingenuity that
can help with climate solutions.
So thank you very much.
Mr. Griffith.
Mr. Griffith. Madam Chair, if I might.
I appreciate your comments. Innovation is extremely
important. It has been interesting, as we have done some of the
hearings, some of the Democrat witnesses and some of the
Republican witnesses have both agreed that this is something
that we need to focus on, in innovation and parity with both
renewables and fossil fuels, because big chunks of the world
are going to use fossil fuels. If we can find a way to make it
cleaner, we are not just helping the United States of America,
we are helping to clean up the world.
Ms. Castor. Thank you.
Mr. Reed. Thank you.
Ms. Castor. All right. Congresswoman Lee, you have been an
outspoken advocate for climate solutions. I am pleased to
recognize you for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. BARBARA LEE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Ms. Lee of California. Thank you very much. Thank you,
Madam Chair and to our ranking member and committee members,
for giving me a chance today to discuss H.R. 1880 and H. Res.
574. My bill and the resolution will help bring attention to
two populations who are often overlooked, women and students,
as it relates to climate change.
First, H.R. 1880 will address the disproportionate effects
that climate change has on women.
Oftentimes, women are the leader of their households and
are responsible for providing necessities to their families.
This puts them in a situation where they feel the brunt of
climate change. Global warming creates additional
responsibilities. Women may be forced to move their families
out of a flood zone that was created because of the rising
oceans. They may need to travel further to obtain water for
children due to a drought created by rising temperatures.
Mothers around the world need to drastically adjust their
lives and make sacrifices to ensure their safety and well-being
of their families. This is why my bill is so important, because
it would help bring attention to this very important issue.
My bill would also establish a working group within the
United States Department of State to help brainstorm potential
solutions to address the disproportionate effects that climate
change has on women and their families. We need America to be a
leader in addressing the climate crisis that is affecting women
around the world.
I would also like now to discuss my resolution on teaching
climate change in schools as part of the school curriculum.
My resolution was inspired by students from the Sonoma
Academy in California. They came to my office with a passion
for more education on sustainability and global warming. They
shared with me some of the resolutions that they have tried to
pass at the State and local levels.
And I also was inspired by Greta Thunberg, a climate
activist from Sweden who boldly skipped school to protest the
need for climate action. Her act of defiance has evolved into a
movement and set precedent for a generation of climate
activism. More than 25 percent of American students took action
at the climate protests to urge us to address climate change.
In order to meaningfully act upon our changing climate,
young people need education on its causes, consequences, and
possible solutions. American students also do not learn enough
about climate change. We need to teach every young person the
human impacts of climate change and how to address our warming
plant--quite frankly, before it is too late.
So I would respectfully ask members of this committee and
my colleagues in Congress to cosponsor H.R. 1880, the Women and
Climate Change Act of 2019, and H. Res. 574, which is the
resolution on teaching climate change in schools.
Finally, let me just say, as a person of faith, Madam
Chair, I believe that we must protect God's creation. We must
secure the future for future generations to come. And so this
committee and what you are doing here and what our colleagues
are doing is such important work. So thank you again for giving
me the chance to be before you.

Testimony of the Hon. Barbara Lee
A Representative in Congress from the State of California
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you, Madam Chair and thank you to the committee members for
allowing me to testify today.
I am here to testify on H.R. 1880 and H. Res 574 and the urgent
need to take up these bills in Congress. My bill and resolution will
help to bring attention to two groups of people that I feel are often
overlooked: women and students.
These bills also greatly reflect the mission of this select
committee to put forward bold legislative ideas to help reduce
greenhouse gas pollution, mitigate the human impact on climate change,
and ensure our communities are resilient.
Specifically, H.R. 1880, the Women and Climate Change Act, will
address the disproportionate effects that climate change has on women.
As many of us know, women are the leader of their households and are
responsible for providing necessities to their families. This puts them
in a situation where they will feel the brunt of climate change.
Global warming creates additional responsibilities. Women may be
forced to move their families out of a flood zone that was created
because of the rising oceans. They may need to travel further to obtain
water for children due to a drought created by rising temperatures.
Mothers around the world need to drastically adjust their lives and
make sacrifices to ensure the safety and well-being of their families.
This is why my bill is so important, because it would help bring
attention to this very important issue.
My bill would also establish a working group within the U.S.
Department of State to help brainstorm potential solutions to address
the disproportionate effects that climate change has on women and their
families. We need America to be a leader in addressing the climate
crisis that is disproportionately affecting women around the world.
I would also like to discuss my resolution on teaching climate
change in schools, H. Res. 574. My resolution was inspired by students
from the Sonoma Academy in California, who came to my office with a
passion for more education on sustainability and global warming. They
shared with me some of the resolutions that they have tried to pass at
the state and local levels.
I was also inspired by Greta Thunberg, a climate activist from
Sweden, who boldly skipped school to protest the need for more climate
action. Her act of defiance has evolved into a movement and set
precedent for a generation of climate activism--more than 25% of
America students took action at the climate protests to urge us to
address climate change.
In order to meaningfully act upon our changing climate, young
people need education on its causes, consequences, and possible
solutions.
American students also do not learn enough about climate change. We
need to teach every young person the human impacts of climate change
and how to address our warming planet before it is too late.
I would respectfully ask members of this committee and my
colleagues in Congress to become cosponsors of H.R. 1880--Women and
Climate Change Act of 2019 and H. Res 574--resolution on teaching
climate change in schools.
And finally, I hope that this Select Committee will take these
important bills up. Thank you again for allowing me to speak and for
your leadership of this select committee.
Thank you, and I yield back.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you very much, Representative Lee.
You are right; we have a moral obligation to our children
and future generations to tackle the climate crisis. And I am
so intrigued by your ideas and your legislation here.
You know, one of the most popular climate solutions books
is Project Drawdown, the organization from your neck of the
woods. And most people wouldn't think of this, but they cite as
one of their top climate solutions educating women and girls
across the world. So we need more help and more detail on how
to craft those kind of policies.
So thank you very much----
Ms. Lee of California. Thank you.
Ms. Castor [continuing]. For your leadership.
Ms. Lee of California. Good to see you.
Ms. Castor. Next, Chairwoman Kaptur, I want to thank you,
because early on you met with me and the professional staff
from the Climate Committee. You have crafted an appropriations
bill that provides significant new research dollars for the
Energy Department and others. You have been a longtime advocate
for clean energy solutions.
So thank you for being here, and you are recognized for 5
minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. MARCY KAPTUR, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO
Ms. Kaptur. Thank you, Chairwoman Castor, for coming to our
office and advocating and including us. We truly appreciate
that and for the invitation to appear today. With the
tremendous turnout of Members, this tells you that our country
is headed in the right direction.
As we know, our world is at a tipping point from the
Earth's thermal heat. And our job in Congress is to manage the
magnitude of the environmental challenge before us and to lead
our people and, in fact, all of humanity to address climate
change and to provide an understandable pathway forward.
Headlines in our local newspapers bring home the gravity of
the crisis. My own hometown paper, The Toledo Blade, just had a
story about, ``Scientists: Earth Under a Climate Emergency.''
Thousands of scientists attest to this. Also, for our own Great
Lakes, ``Overflowing Lakes Pose New Threat for Birds,'' the
threat to sea life in our part of the United States. And then
in The Washington Post, a recent headline, ``Wildfires: A
Can't-Win Challenge for California.''
These challenges are indeed daunting, but the combined
commitment of all of us, of enlightened people, can result in
positive change.
I believe, regionally, we must use these types of stories
to inform the American people and include in what we do
together a multimedia approach to the crisis, for example, by
region, inviting people to view films like ``Planet Ocean'' and
``Blue Planet'' to help deliver an important message of cause
and effect to the American people and, in fact, to many of the
staff members here on Capitol Hill and perhaps even some of the
Members.
The American people are demanding action, and there is
little patience. So it is my hope that, by working together
across the committees of jurisdiction, Congress can quickly
advance a climate package that is regionally sensitive and
demarked by related watersheds.
We know the enduring impacts of climate change are
resulting in increasing rainfall, rising seas, severe
hurricanes and tornados, increasing wildfires and tornados, and
countless other impacts.
I am going to move regionally now so I can better develop
the point about how important it is by watersheds to bring
people together regionally. In the interest of time, let me
focus on the Great Lakes region.
Our Ninth Congressional District runs along the south edge,
the entire perimeter almost, of Lake Erie, the shallowest and
southernmost of the Great Lakes, which contain, together, 84
percent of North America's fresh surface water and 21 percent
of the world's surface fresh water.
In 2014, a massive harmful algal bloom forced the city of
Toledo, a town of over 300,000 people and a coastal city, to
shut off its fresh water supply, the first in the country to do
so other than Flint, Michigan, for a different reason there.
For days, citizens could not drink, bathe, or cook from the
tap.
This particular algal bloom was only the start. Since then,
Lake Erie has faced an annual algal bloom that threatens our
region's economic future. Year after year, a massive green
bloom engulfs the region, as rainfall and lake levels rise to
124-year highs. And adjacent farmland tiling is totally
inadequate to hold back the water and nutrients to the lake.
This algal bloom is not an anomaly. In the last year, we
have seen massive rainfall events that continue to feed the
ever-increasing annual algal bloom. I know about the issue in
the Everglades and Lake Okeechobee as well.
The Fourth National Climate Assessment documents a clear
impact of climate change for our region. Between 1973 and 2010,
ice cover on our Great Lakes declined an average of 71 percent,
by three-quarters, and this means greater evaporation and real
changes in sea life.
Change and action are needed. Warm autumns mean larger
algal blooms, larger ones every year. And more rainfall means
more farm runoff and a greater need for a farm nutrient control
system, including advanced tilling and irrigation systems. And
with one-half of the land owned by absentee owners, the
daunting challenge of how do you do this remains before us.
An effective approach requires, in our region, both the
U.S. and Canada to cooperate on a broader scale and a
commitment to engaging the world through such agreements as the
Paris Climate Agreement.
Further, agricultural America needs a regenerative soils
approach to help farmers utilize their fields to soak up excess
carbon. I associate myself with what Congresswoman Bustos
mentioned in her testimony a little earlier.
Our approach globally must wean our economy off our over-
reliance on carbon-based fuels to reduce the destructive impact
of greenhouse gases on the upper atmosphere. And as Congress
writes this comprehensive approach, our Nation needs an
enhanced research and development bridge to the future.
So, in closing, let me say that the Department of Energy
must play and is playing an enormous role to address these
necessary energy changes. The Department of Energy is the
Federal Government's leading agency on the research and
development of new clean-energy technologies.
In the bill our subcommittee has written for 2020, we
propose critical funding for energy innovation in all sectors.
And our country has been at the forefront in energy innovation
across all sectors through research grants, loan programs, tax
incentives, laboratory facilities, pilot programs, and public-
private partnerships.
But in terms of a regional transition, let me associate
myself with the remarks of the Congresswoman from California,
who talked about transitioning people as well----
Ms. Castor. Thank you very much.
Mr. Kaptur [continuing]. In the coal well-worn regions of
the country, as well as the nuclear plants, where we are having
real trouble with transition.
So thank you so very much for allowing me to appear today.
And let me just say as a mark of hope, I think one of the
impressive pictures that I present to the public has to do with
our ability to ban fluorocarbons from the air and the healing
of the ozone layer as a result. We are about a different task
right now, but I believe, working together, we can achieve a
similarly very positive solution.
And thank you so much.
[The statement of Ms. Kaptur follows:]

Testimony of the Hon. Marcia ``Marcy'' Kaptur
A Representative in Congress from the State of Ohio
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you, Chair Castor, for the invitation to speak before your
committee.
As we know, our world is at a tipping point. The American people
are demanding action, and there is little patience. It is my hope, that
by working together, across committees of jurisdiction, we can quickly
advance a climate package.
Localizing Climate Impacts
Every time I am home, I see the impacts of climate change.
My district includes a broad swath of Lake Erie. The Great Lakes
contain 84% of North America's surface freshwater and 21% of the
world's surface freshwater. The health of our lakes determines the
social opportunities for 30 million people living on the lakes. And as
a region, we have begun speaking with a more unified voice to protect
the Great Lakes. However, climate change poses an existential threat to
my region.
In 2014, a massive harmful algal bloom forced Toledo to shut off
its water. For days, citizens could not drink, bathe, or cook from the
tap. In a modern economy with sophisticated infrastructure, we take
ready access to freshwater for granted. But for three days, my region
rationed water during this ecological emergency.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
This algal bloom was only the start. Since then, Lake Erie has
faced an annual algal bloom that threatens our region's economic
future. Year after year, a massive green bloom engulfs my region.
And this algal bloom is not an anomaly. In the last year, we have
seen massive rainfall events that continue to feed the ever-increasing
annual algal bloom. Ironically, the enormous early spring rains
flooding Lake Erie in 2019 delayed the spring plantings and meant that
there was less nutrient run off than expected. The spring rains that
threatened farm production meant the Lake Erie Algal Bloom was only 700
square miles this year!
The Fourth National Climate Assessment documents a clear impact of
climate change for my region. Between 1973 and 2010, ice cover on the
Great Lakes declined an average of 71%. And the lakes are becoming
warmer with summer water temperatures increasing. The islands in my
district used to be regularly connected to the mainland by ice cover in
the winter. But today, the ice is thinner, and the journey to the
islands becomes more treacherous.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
This is the problem, but as you know, there is a solution.
It involves a broader solution and a commitment to engaging the
world through the Paris Climate Agreement. A larger package must wean
our economy off our over reliance on carbon-based fuels.
As Congress writes this larger package, we need a research and
development bridge to the future.
DOE's Role in Energy Changes
In the bill I have written, the FY 2020 Energy and Water
Development Act, I have proposed critical funding for energy innovation
at the Department of Energy. The United States has been at the
forefront of energy innovation to address climate challenges by
providing research grants, loan programs, tax incentives, laboratory
facilities, pilot programs, and public-private partnerships. DOE is the
federal government's leading agency on the research and development of
new clean energy technologies.
Decades of investment by DOE has driven down costs for clean energy
technologies, enabling increased deployment as they become cost-
competitive with conventional energy sources. These advances in clean
energy technology have led to job creation in every region and every
state in America.
Although the U.S. has been a leader in energy innovation and DOE
has made significant gains in real solutions to climate change, there
are still opportunities to advance new and improved clean energy
technologies. Additional investment in energy innovation is critical to
meeting goals for addressing climate change.
Thank you for the invitation to speak today and for your commitment
to holding these public hearings. Members of Congress are tremendous
advocates and spokespersons for the local and very real impacts of
climate change.
Ms. Castor. Thank you very much, Ms. Kaptur, for your
detailed presentation.
Mr. Beyer, you are welcome to provide your testimony here
for 5 minutes. You are recognized.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. DON BEYER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF VIRGINIA
Mr. Beyer. Thank you, Madam Chair and Ranking Member. I am
very grateful for the opportunity to testify before you and to
share our best policy ideas on the climate change.
When I ran 5 years ago, the central theme of this campaign
and every one was that I would try to be the strongest,
clearest voice I could be, in my humble way, on climate change.
So I was really proud when Dr. Lowenthal asked me to co-lead
the Safe Climate Caucus, which is mostly about educating
Members about how we can better address climate change. And I
now co-chair the New Democrat Climate Change Task Force. We
have put together a set of 13 bills, most of which are now
bipartisan, to address climate change.
Three overarching priorities. The first: U.S. global
leadership on climate change and responding to the threat it
poses to our national security. Many years ago, 10 years ago, I
was in Copenhagen for COP 15, when it was abundantly clear with
every person I talked to from other nations that they were
looking to the U.S. first for climate change leadership.
Second is to take an economy-wide and a market-oriented
approach--Federal investments and carbon pricing.
And, third, that we invest in our communities and our
workers, people like the coal miners in Morgan Griffith's
district, and by resolving the environmental injustices and by
fostering adaptation, resilience, and relief.
I have my own climate playbook of bills. I would like to
detail seven of them.
The first is something that Chris Van Hollen introduced
many years ago and we have done every year since, the Healthy
Climate and Family Security Act, which places a cap on carbon
pollution in alignment with the IPCC report, and then it has a
polluter-pays principle to emit carbon within those caps.
It is an economic dividend approach, where all of the money
is given back to the American people. So 80 percent get more
back than they put in, making sure that it is progressive
rather than regressive. And it recognizes that polluters should
pay, gives businesses the ability to plan long-term, and it
reduces the burden of impact on disproportionately impacted
communities.
I think everyone agrees, across the economic spectrum, that
carbon pricing will accelerate innovation and incentivize
greater energy efficiency better than anything else.
The second bill is the New Democrat Coalition's National
Oceans and Coastal Security Improvements Act to support coastal
communities' ability to prepare for and respond to a variety of
coastal threats--extreme weather events, climate hazards,
changing ocean conditions. These coastal communities are
literally and figuratively under water. So this will help these
well-known, unmet, imminent needs.
The third bill is the Community Health and Clean Transit
Act, about to be introduced, which will provide zero-interest
loans to qualified transit districts for the marginal costs of
electricity and fuel-cell stuff and the needed charging
infrastructure. You know, fuel-cell or electric busing costs
$150,000 to $300,000 more. This will help local transit
districts be able to afford them.
The fourth is tax credit legislation modeled off the
original EV tax to help move vans, pickup light-duty trucks,
and other commercial vehicles toward a zero-emission future. It
is really fascinating, how much is already happening. I think
DHL has announced everything in Europe will be electric, in
terms of the commercial side. But it will be an enormous move
forward.
The fifth addresses flight: the Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes
Act. My bill would build upon NASA's existing mission,
specifically its aeronautics mission, and bolster its capacity
to create electrified and non-greenhouse-gas-emitting flight.
I read a fascinating story last night that showed that,
among the people that are emitting the most greenhouse gases
per year per person, something like 69 percent of it is the
flights they take. So, to the extent that we move to electric
airplanes, it will be an important correction.
Number six is the Wildlife Corridors Conservation Act,
which your excellent staffer, Kenzie Landa, had a big hand in.
E.O. Wilson, the professor at Harvard who created the idea of
biodiversity, says it is the most important biodiversity bill
in an generation. And this is bipartisan. Vern Buchanan, among
others, is leading it on the Republican side. To connect--
connectivity from native species, everything from the pronghorn
antelope to the Florida panther to wolves and grizzly bears and
butterflies and often plants also. If we believe biodiversity
is essential, this will move us there.
And, lastly, the bipartisan SEA FUEL Act. Morgan and I have
talked for years about carbon recapture. This will throw in the
aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other things that the Department
of Defense needs. There is mature technology which we can help
do to pull carbon capture out of the ocean to run our fleet. By
the way, if you care about ocean acidification and the super-
saturation of CO2 in the ocean, this is a really
helpful bill.
So these seven bills will all move us in the right
direction. And, of course, please look deeply at the package
coming out of the New Democrat Coalition which is also very
thoughtful.
And thank you for the opportunity to do this.
[The statement of Mr. Beyer follows:]
----------
Testimony of the Hon. Donald ``Don'' Beyer
A Representative in Congress from the State of Virginia
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you so much for having this hearing!
I am honored by the opportunity to testify before you and be one of
many members sharing our best policy ideas to address the climate
crisis.
I ran on addressing climate change as a central tenet of my
candidacy for office and I have tried to be the strongest, clearest
voice I can on addressing climate change in Congress.
I was proud to be asked by Mr. Lowenthal to help co-lead the Safe
Climate Caucus, which works to educate all Members on how we can all
better address climate change and elevate Member efforts.
I am also a Co-Chair of the New Democrat Coalition Climate Change
Task Force, where I have been working with my colleagues to move an
evidence-based, comprehensive framework to address the threat of
climate change with the rapid urgency this crisis demands.
We have three overarching policy priorities:
Promote U.S. global leadership on climate and
respond to the threat climate change poses to our national
security
Take an economy-wide and market-oriented approach
through policies such as federal investments in tech-inclusive
research, development, and deployment, and carbon pricing; and
Investing in and supporting our communities and
workers by resolving inequities and fostering adaptation,
resilience, and relief.
The New Democrat Coalition endorsed a slate of bills that
correspond with those aims, many of which are bipartisan, and I highly
encourage your committee to take a look.
I have my own climate playbook of bills that I am advancing to help
in the effort to tackle this crisis.
First and foremost, the Healthy Climate and Family Security Act,
which places a cap on carbon pollution to align with the
recommendations of the IPCC report.
It then applies a `polluter pays' principle by requiring polluters
to pay to emit carbon within those caps.
Finally, the revenue raised from the sale of those permits is
returned straight to the American people.
This is the fasted, clearest way to move us in the right direction.
It recognizes that polluters should pay, helps businesses plan long
term and more quickly reduces the burden on disproportionately impacted
communities.
On an economy-wide level, the price signal will accelerate
innovation and incentivize both greater energy efficiency as well as
greater use of lower-carbon energy alternatives.
The second bill I want to mention is my bill which is included in
the slate of the bills endorsed by the New Democrat Coalition, the
National Ocean and Coastal Security Improvements Act.
This bipartisan bill would support coastal communities' ability to
prepare for and respond to a variety of coastal threats, including
extreme weather events, climate hazards and changing ocean conditions
by improving coastal infrastructure and supporting coastal research,
resiliency, conservation and restoration work.
Our states and localities are literally and figuratively underwater
in their ability to become climate resilient.
This bill would help address these well-known unmet, imminent needs
and ensure we have viable coastal economies for future generations.
This shouldn't be the case where only the rich can become
resilient. It is imperative that we help coastal communities adapt.
The third bill I want to mention my soon to be introduced Community
Health and Clean Transit Act, which provides zero interest loans to
qualified transit districts for the marginal costs of electric and fuel
and needed charging infrastructure.
The upfront capital costs of fuel cell or electric buses are
prohibitive for many transit and school districts.
They can cost $150,000 to $300,000 more than a conventional diesel
bus.
This bill would help local transit districts who want to lead on
climate or reduce their long-term operating costs by helping them in
their goal to invest in electric or fuel cell buses.
Keeping in the transportation theme since it the primary source of
carbon emissions--we've had some important advances in emissions on the
personal vehicle side but continue to lag behind other countries in
terms of electrification for commercial vehicles.
I'll shortly be introducing tax credit legislation modelled off the
original EV tax credit to help move vans, pickup, light duty trucks and
other commercial vehicles towards a zero emissions future.
And the third bill in my soon to be introduced transportation
package, addresses flight--the Cleaner, Quieter Airplanes Act.
My bill would build upon NASA's existing mission and bolster its
capacity to create electrified and non-greenhouse gas emitting flight.
I've mentioned economy wide emissions, coastal resilience and
adaption, as well as transportation, I also want to mention my bill to
help with biodiversity.
The Wildlife Corridors Conservation Act would give species a
fighting chance at survival in the face of climate change.
The Wildlife Corridors Conservation Act provides a framework to
address the long-term habitat connectivity of native species.
This bill identifies wildlife corridors that aim to mitigate harm
to wildlife and threats to public safety by implementing strategies to
reduce human and wildlife conflict.
And lastly, I'll mention a 7th bill in my climate armada--the
bipartisan SEA FUEL Act.
To run the aircraft, ships, vehicles, and other equipment necessary
to defend our nation and conduct operations abroad, the Department of
Defense relies heavily on an extensive logistics chain to transport
fuel around the globe.
This transportation infrastructure comes with significant costs and
could be targeted by our adversaries to diminish our ability to project
power in a foreign conflict.
My bill help address these issues by authorizing the Department of
Defense and the Department of Homeland Security to mature new
technologies to generate fuel directly from ocean water and the
atmosphere, reducing the logistics tail of our military and increasing
the resiliency of our overseas operations.
The program builds on existing efforts and patented technology
invested in by the U.S. Navy and our national laboratories.
The IPCC report emphasizes the importance of negative emissions
technologies in reaching net zero emissions by 2050.
This bill would both address that goal and our national security.
These are 7 of many of the ideas that I am trying to advance to
address our climate crisis.
I hope you consider them.
We need everyone invested in this fight and all the good ideas on
the table in order to meet net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 at
the latest--and that, as you all know, is only to mitigate the worst
impacts of climate change.
I appreciate the opportunity to be here today. This hearing
provides hope that we're on the right track.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Mr. Beyer. You have provided a
strong and clear voice on climate solutions. So thank you very
much for being here.
Mr. Phillips, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. DEAN PHILLIPS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MINNESOTA
Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Chairwoman Castor and Mr. Griffith
and members of the committee.
Climate change is an existential threat to the health and
national security, economic prosperity, and future of the
American people and our planet. Indeed, our habitat is at
stake. Humankind's ability to survive, let alone thrive, on a
dramatically changing planet is very much in question.
The Fourth National Climate Assessment and the 2018
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the IPCC, have
illustrated an urgent and very inconvenient truth, and that is
that we are running out of time. The IPCC 2018 report found
that even a 1.5-degree Celsius increase would have a disastrous
effect on our habitat.
To do our part in preventing the most drastic impacts of
climate change and to stay below that 1.5-degree threshold, the
United States must achieve the goals committed to in the Paris
climate accords and attain net-zero emissions by 2050 at the
latest.
Mr. Phillips. Limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius is
still possible, and it is a call to action that we must heed
with seriousness. We have already seen the impacts of climate
change in my home State of Minnesota. The Great Lakes region is
warming faster than most regions in the United States. A lack
of action will result in growing numbers of people exposed to
water scarcity, extreme heat, and displacement from sea level
rise, and severe weather events. The costs are rising and the
science is clear. We cannot let the enormity of the issue
overwhelm us. We must start addressing the problem immediately.
That is why I am a member of the New Dems Climate Task
Force, as referenced by my colleague from Virginia, Mr. Beyer.
Our goal is to put forth an ambitious pro-climate and pro-
market agenda that leverages every decarbonization solution
available to advance a swift and just transition to a clean
economy.
We need to be focused on solutions to the climate crisis.
One of those I find most promising is carbon pricing. I am in
support of H.R. 763, the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend
Act, a bipartisan bill with Republican roots, which puts a fee
on fossil fuels like coal, oil, and gas. Climate change has a
price, and this legislation ensures that big polluters are the
ones paying for it. By starting low and growing over time, it
will drive down carbon pollution by incentivizing energy
companies, industries, and consumers to move towards cleaner,
renewable options. The rate begins at $15 per ton in the first
year and increases by $10 per ton each year, and is subject to
further adjustments based on the progress in meeting specified
emissions reduction targets. Best of all, it is completely
revenue neutral. The money collected from the carbon fee is
allocated in equal shares every month to American taxpayers to
spend as they see fit. Program costs are paid for from the fees
collected.
In this legislation, the government does not keep any of
the money from the carbon fee. Returning revenue from carbon
fees directly to people as carbon dividends, which is payments
to every person, would transform carbon pricing from a
regressive policy into a progressive one. This policy is all
about incentivizing the change which many, including myself,
find to be the most effective way to realize our climate goals.
The price signals motivate consumers, businesses, and
governments alike to invest in renewables and energy
efficiency, and carbon dividends would yield a net increase in
income for everyone whose carbon footprint is smaller than
average.
People with larger carbon footprints pull up that average
and would pay more in higher fuel expenditures than they would
get back in dividends, while the majority of households,
including the most low-income and middle-class families in
America, would come out ahead. In addition, a clean energy
transition will need smart regulations and public investments
as well as aggressive emission limits. Carbon pricing is not
the only answer to the climate crisis, but it is one of the
most effective tools to meeting the goals of the IPCC.
There are many commonsense environmental policies that we
can and should pursue; however, it is true with climate issues
as it is with every other important policy issue that we
consider in this body that in order to begin making meaningful
change, we must reform our government. Too many wealthy special
interests have far too much influence and control over climate
policy. It is time to end the corrupting influence of special
interest money in the halls of Congress and do what is right
for our planet, for our children, and for our future.
When it comes to our climate, environment, and habitat, we
are living in an era of great opportunity and great
consequence. The time to act, the time to lead is now.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Ms. Castor. Thank you very much, Mr. Phillips. Thank you
for your recommendations for action to the committee.

Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you, Chairwoman Castor, Ranking Member Graves and members of
the Committee.
Thank you for the invitation to offer testimony this afternoon on
this urgent problem.
Climate change is an existential threat to the health, national
security, economic prosperity, and future of the American people and
our planet.
Our habitat is at stake----
Human kind's ability to thrive on a dramatically changing planet is
in question----
The Fourth National Climate Assessment and the 2018
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) have illustrated an
urgent and inconvenient truth--we're out of time.

STATEMENT OF THE HON. DEREK KILMER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON
Mr. Kilmer. Thank you, Chair Castor, for holding this
important hearing today and for taking on this important
challenge.
I was born and raised on the Olympic peninsula in northwest
Washington State, and I am now honored to represent the
district that I grew up in. In the Pacific Northwest, we have a
sense of urgency about addressing climate change, and that
urgency is driven in part by the fact that we are already
seeing its impacts.
Where I am from, we have four coastal tribes that, as we
sit here, are in the process of trying to move to higher ground
because of rising sea levels, more severe storms, not to
mention the threat of tsunami. Catastrophic wildfires threaten
the health and safety of communities throughout the Pacific
Northwest, and our region's largest employer, the United States
Navy, identifies climate change as a threat multiplier that
makes our world less safe. That shouldn't be surprising. We
have seen decades of scientific evidence that climate change
will lead to devastating environmental, economic, public
health, and national security consequences. Climate change is
real and it requires bold action. And sadly, that commitment to
science and that sense of urgency have been largely absent from
the current administration.
While President Obama took significant steps to address
this challenge, President Trump, immediately upon taking
office, began rolling back those policies. He has begun the
process to remove America from the Paris climate agreement. He
has repealed efforts to reduce carbon emissions from power
plants and automobile tailpipes, and those actions are
wrongheaded. And to protect our communities, our national
security, and our economic interest, we have a moral obligation
to act.
The scientific consensus is that we need to achieve the
critical goal of economywide, net-zero greenhouse gas emissions
by 2050. That means we need to catch up to our global peers and
our competitors, and it means we need to build a politically
resilient roadmap that outlasts election cycles.
I am honored to serve as the chair of the New Democrat
Coalition, a group of over 100 forward-looking House Democrats,
who all share a commitment to develop endurable policy
solutions to our most pressing issues. And I am proud that our
coalition created a new climate change task force to develop an
ambitious and actionable policy strategy to address the threat
of climate change.
Our agenda is grounded in three main principles. First,
that combating climate change requires global action. America
should be leading the way in combating climate change, not
sitting on the sidelines, and that is why, among other
strategies, our coalition endorsed the Climate Action Now Act
to recommit to the Paris climate accord.
Second, transitioning to a climate-forward economy
represents an opportunity to mobilize our economy and create
high-quality jobs.
Other nations have recognized that combating climate change
can lead to new innovations, new industries, and new jobs. The
United States should too. What is more, we should ensure
Federal energy and technology policies enable our country to
leverage every decarbonization tool available to reach our
goals.
Among other strategies, our agenda focuses on clean energy
innovation. We have endorsed bills to increase Federal research
and to encourage the development and adoption of green
innovation. We can also set predictable pricing those through
market-based solutions like carbon pricing and greenhouse gas
emission standards.
And finally, enacting a climate-forward agenda requires
investing in communities, resilience, and relief. We cannot
leave frontline communities behind. The House has already
passed three pieces of legislation to expand research and
innovation to understand and address ocean acidification and
coastal community vulnerabilities. Additionally, we need to
empower workers in communities to navigate economic change, not
to be victims of it.
Earlier this fall, we saw marches taking place all across
our Nation urging leaders to do something. These young
activists made a powerful statement, and now leaders in
Washington, D.C. need to make real progress. While D.C.
currently has divided government, which has been our reality
for nearly a decade, we can't wait. With each passing day as
more greenhouse gases are emitted into our atmosphere, the
crisis becomes more difficult to combat. We cannot afford for
solutions to get caught up in partisan battles or for
persistent inaction. We need to make progress today, and that
is why the New Democrat Coalition endorsed several bills that
have bipartisan support in the House and in the Senate and that
can make a difference today. And I have brought you a list of
the bills that we have endorsed, and I hope I can submit those
for the record.
Ms. Castor. Without objection.

Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Mr. Kilmer. The New Dems have
been out in force today, and I appreciate it. Thank you for
your leadership.
Next, we are going to go to Chairman DeFazio and I want to
thank him for his years of focus on the climate crisis. He is
going to be a linchpin in everything that America does,
especially when it comes to transportation and infrastructure
and all of the policies that we need to enact moving forward,
so thank you very much for being here, Mr. Chairman. You are
recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. PETER A. DeFAZIO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OREGON
Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Madam Chair, and thanks for
convening this hearing today.
As you did point out, transportation is the single largest
contributor to climate change and carbon pollution in the
United States, so we have to defossilize transportation. There
are a number of steps in the bill we are drafting for the
reauthorization of a 21st century transportation bill that will
move us in that direction. Electrification of the national
highway network is a key factor. My committee even witnessed in
Sweden an experiment with trucks that charge as they are
driving, full-size heavy trucks. And, of course, I have seen
Tesla electric truck, which is fabulous. We need advances in
battery technology. I hope you will recommend that the Federal
Government make investments in battery and storage technologies
of all sorts.
Secondly, of course, the most carbon efficient way of
transit transportation is walking and the pedestrian. We are
having record fatalities, and we have got to make our cities
safer so more and more people can choose those options. And
there will be very substantial investment in that. Transit has
fallen into a state of disrepair. Much more energy efficient,
much of it is already electrified, and we need to bring that up
to a state of good repair. That is a hundred billion dollars,
let alone building out new transit options for people.
The most efficient way to move freight--well, we have all
seen the ads from CSX, rail is way more efficient than trucks,
but the most efficient way is maritime. So we are going to do
additional investments in the inland waterway system in our
harbors and ports and encourage something that is hard to say,
if I won't stumble over it, short sea shipping. And so we
need--on the coast, we could be moving a heck of a lot more
goods on the oceans, and it is incredibly energy efficient. The
IMO, the International Maritime Organization, has set goals
for--at least is moving away from dirty bunker fuel moving to
cleaner fuels. But Maersk, the largest shipping company, has
said that they are going to be totally carbon free by 2050.
So, you know, we need--there is some incredibly interesting
things going on in maritime with sail assist and solar and
hybrids and those sorts of things. So, again, an area that
could benefit from a boost from the Federal Government.
In my committee also, we passed out the first wastewater
bill reauthorization, SRS, since 1987. And having heard
testimony from a sewer authority in New Jersey, I put in a
mandate that any future Federal investment in wastewater that
if it is technologically feasible, and that would only be--it
wouldn't be if it was a retrofit of an old plant, perhaps, they
have to capture their methane and generate electricity. And
this sewer district in New Jersey is actually providing all
their own electricity and making money by selling on to the
grid.
Also, the Federal Government is the largest single lessor
or owner of commercial office space in the United States of
America. We are doing platinum LEED now, but there is a
standard beyond platinum LEED, which is carbon neutral
buildings. And I am going to be moving the GSA in that
direction to carbon neutral buildings. And then as we rebuild
our infrastructure, we have to rebuild it in a way, obviously,
that is resilient for severe climate events. We also will have
to rebuild it in a way that can potentially accommodate
autonomous vehicles. But beyond that, there are new materials
out there. There is even a form of concrete that absorbs
carbon, and you can also mix carbon into standard concrete,
lower the footprint of producing the concrete and, you know,
permanently encapsulate that carbon and it actually strengthens
the concrete. It is a winner all the way around.
So we are going to be looking at new materials that are
less carbon polluting, more resilient, as we look to the
future.
Finally, two other quick points. I have a bill, the Act for
the Amazon Act, which would go after Brazil for the deliberate
deforestation, and would prohibit the import of goods that are
produced on deforested tropical lands and put some other
incentives or, some might say, penalties on Brazil.
And then finally, I heard earlier mention from one of my
colleagues, the idea of cap and dividend. I am working on a
little different version, which would have a progressive
dividend. I don't see why a billionaire who flies around in a
private jet and owns 12 houses should get the same rebate that
a family of three living in Springfield, Oregon, gets. So, you
know, I am looking at modifying that proposal.
With that, Madam Chair, thank you for your leadership on
this issue. It is only about the future of the planet.

Testimony of the Hon. Peter DeFazio
A Representative in Congress from the State of Oregon
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Chair Castor and Ranking Member Graves: Thank you for holding
today's hearing. To be successful in combatting the climate crisis, all
ideas must be on the table. As a leader in this fight, I appreciate the
opportunity to share my ideas and priorities.
Climate change is an existential threat to the planet as we know
it, and we have a moral obligation to act aggressively and immediately.
Congress has a duty to ensure the youth of today and future generations
inherit an environment that is healthy and sustainable.
We are already experiencing the consequences of inaction. Our
summers are getting hotter, droughts more frequent, and ocean
acidification continues to escalate. In my district, our forests have
become tinderboxes. Last year, and the year before, Southwest Oregon
experienced devastating wildfires that burned hundreds of thousands of
acres and generated hundreds of thousands of tons of carbon emissions.
The fires not only destroyed our forests and private lands, they also
affected our recreation and tourism industry and produced dangerous
levels of smoke that threatened public health. Earlier this year, my
district experienced flooding and snow levels we haven't seen in
decades.
We ignore at our peril that climate change has occurred because of
human activities. Recent studies by prominent climate scientists
provide a critical wake-up call and reveal the damage that has already
taken place. One, published in November 2017 by my constituent, Oregon
State University professor Dr. Bill Ripple, is entitled ``World
Scientists' Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice,'' and endorsed by
more than 15,000 scientists. In the first ``Warning to Humanity''
report, released 25 years before, scientists called on humanity to make
changes or, ``so alter the living world that it will be unable to
sustain in the manner that we know.'' Sadly, Dr. Ripple found that we
had only made progress in one major area: our effort to reduce the
amount of ozone-depleting substances.
This past Earth Day I participated in a conference with Dr. Ripple
to discuss his findings. While his study laid out the urgency of
reversing the current path to environmental destruction, it also
provided ways we can address climate change today. Dr. Ripple's study
found that one of the most effective ways we can reduce carbon
emissions is to support policies that have a strong federal mandate to
reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the U.S. and abroad.
Again working with a team of international climate experts, Dr.
Ripple released his second warning which reinforced his initial study,
using data that tracks the vital signs of climatic impact. His report
declared that not only has the climate crisis arrived, it is
accelerating faster than most scientists expected, and is more severe
than anticipated.
In September, the International Panel on Climate Change issued the
``Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate'' report. Like Dr.
Ripple's 2017 study, the report held dire warnings about the damage
climate change is having on ocean ecosystems and the danger it poses to
the billions of people that live along coastlines. It provided more
evidence that melting ice sheets and glaciers, sea level rise, and
ocean acidification are getting worse. The research also found that the
ocean also experiences ``heat waves,'' just like those that occur on
land. Ocean heat waves impact nearly all marine life by disrupting the
ocean's food chain. In 2014 and 2015, an ocean heat wave called ``the
Blob'' occurred in the Pacific Northwest. It wreaked havoc off the
Oregon coast, causing the largest algal bloom ever recorded in our
region, shutting down crabbing and other fisheries for months. If
oceans continue to warm and acidification intensifies, Oregon's coastal
economies could collapse.
Thankfully, there are ways to not only reverse the damage to the
ocean but also to use the ocean as a way reduce climate change. Another
of my constituents, Oregon State University Distinguished professor and
former Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration Dr. Jane Lubchenco, recently led the High Level Panel
for A Sustainable Ocean Economy's report ``the Ocean as a Solution to
Climate Change'' which found the ocean can be a powerful tool to
sequester carbon as well as development of renewable energy sources.
The report found that developing off-shore energy sources while not
negatively affecting marine life, restoring blue carbon ecosystems such
as seagrasses and salt marshes, and using alternative fuels in the
shipping industry can significantly contribute to combatting climate
change.
As I noted at the beginning of my testimony, there is no one policy
that will achieve the significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions
we need for humanity to survive. A decade ago, I was one of the first
Members of Congress to be the lead cosponsor of a bill to cap,
regulate, and reduce emissions, and I believe that is a policy we must
consider. Other incentives I support to expedite the transition to a
one hundred percent renewable energy portfolio, such as progressive
carbon fee and dividend or similar proposals are a vital part of how to
accomplish this.
Yet it's critical to ensure that our policies do not
unintentionally hurt struggling low income, rural communities, or
benefit some regions while penalizing others. That is one reason I am
an original cosponsor of H. Res. 109, also known as the Green New Deal.
Beyond laying out a bold action plan to quickly achieve net-zero
greenhouse gas emissions, it makes clear that we can create millions of
good, high-wage jobs in every region of the country.
At twenty-nine percent, the transportation sector is now the
biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the U.S. Within the
transportation sector, passenger and freight vehicles contribute 83
percent of global warming emissions. Congress must act to combat this,
and as Chair of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, I
intend to comprehensively tackle the transportation system's effect on
climate change as part of the upcoming surface transportation bill.
We must address emissions from passenger vehicles, and that means
eliminating emissions from single occupancy vehicles through
electrification and investing in modes of transportation that don't
involve taking a car at all. Far greater investment in public transit
and bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure will provide safe, reliable,
competitive alternatives to single occupancy vehicles that choke our
interstate highway system, burn fossil fuels sitting in traffic, and
slow the efficient movement of freight. Transit needs a shot in the arm
to bring rolling stock and rail systems to a state of good repair.
Further resources must be brought to bear to increase levels of service
to provide transit riders reliable and frequent service that gets them
where they need to go when they need to be there.
The lowest carbon mode of transportation is walking and biking.
Today, record numbers of Americans are walking and biking as a primary
mode of transport, but also record numbers of American cyclists and
pedestrians are dying on our roadways. In fact, the National Highway
Transportation Safety Administration reported that, nearly 20
bicyclists and pedestrians were killed every single day last year.\1\
My transportation bill will include new funding to improve safety and
help cities create the network of walking and biking infrastructure
that will allow people to safely walk and bike in their communities.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I also realize, however, that many Americans, especially those in
rural areas, will continue to drive. We must invest in the
infrastructure to support a shift from carbon-based fuel sources to
electric and zero emission vehicle technology and fueling systems. My
bill will lay the groundwork for an electrified highway system to
reduce range anxiety and further the broad adoption of zero emission
vehicles.
While reducing carbon emissions from the transportation sector will
have the largest impact, there are other areas within the
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's jurisdiction in which I'm
pushing changes that will help reduce human impacts on climate change.
For example, last month my committee passed a landmark
reauthorization of the Clean Water State Revolving Fund which includes
a requirement for utilities to maximize their energy efficiency
potential, including the recapture and reuse of methane emissions.
Innovative approaches like this should be part of our nation's
comprehensive strategy to combat climate change.
I intend to provide continued federal leadership in the
administration of public building contracts, moving the GSA beyond the
current LEED standards and towards carbon neutral facilities. In
addition, other modes within the transportation sector will need to
become more sustainable. We need to expand access to renewable jet
fuel, increase freight transport by water, and reduce the carbon
emissions of overseas shipping. As a matter of fact, A.P. Møller
Maersk--the world's largest ocean carrier--and other maritime
stakeholders in the Global Maritime Forum have committed to decarbonize
ocean shipping by 2050. We should follow their lead across other
transportation modes.
Finally, as we actively work to reduce emissions, we also need to
steel ourselves with more resilient infrastructure. Revisiting design
standards in flood-prone areas, utilizing less carbon intensive
materials, and incorporating natural infrastructure are all techniques
that must be part of our future infrastructure plans. Building
infrastructure that will have a smaller carbon footprint and be more
resilient to storms of greater intensity will help prepare us for the
changing climate and reduce the long-term costs for recovery after
damaging storms.
Threats to our climate are happening around the world. Although
outside our borders these climate crises have impacts at home. In
response to the devasting fires and continued illegal deforestation in
the Amazon, I introduced H.R. 4263, the Act for the Amazon Act. The
bill would ban the import of items produced by illegal deforestation,
halt military aid, and prohibit a free trade agreement with Brazil
until their government ends the devastation caused by the fires and
illegal deforestation. The Amazon serves as the lungs of the earth.
Without significant intervention to curtail destruction of the
rainforest, it will impact rainfall in the United States, dramatically
reduce our crop yields and food supply, and increase the extreme
conditions for catastrophic wildfires in the Pacific Northwest. We must
act to end the destruction of the rainforest, and my bill takes a
significant step to do so.
There are numerous technologies that can reduce emissions or
sequester carbon. Some are mature and in use today, and some are in a
nascent stage of development. For example, we must promote the use and
development of 100 percent renewable hydrogen. In early August I held a
roundtable to raise awareness of the potential for renewable hydrogen
to power parts of our transportation system, maximize the efficiency of
renewable energy production, and make our communities more resilient
during natural disasters, all while significantly lowering carbon
emissions. I brought together utilities, a major car manufacturer,
energy entrepreneurs, and nonprofits dedicated to fighting climate
change through substantive policy.
Renewable hydrogen is a clean fuel that can power cars, buses,
trains, ships, and even electric utilities while only emitting water
vapor as a byproduct. To produce this hydrogen, electricity is used to
split or ``crack'' water into hydrogen and oxygen. When that
electricity comes from renewable energy sources like wind and solar,
then we have a revolutionary fuel that could potentially meet
significant amounts of energy needs without any carbon emissions.
The ability to store surplus renewably-generated electricity is one
of the most challenging aspects to achieve a 100 percent renewable
energy future. By using renewable electricity to convert water into
hydrogen, we can store hydrogen fuel in fuel cells that can generate
power when we need it.
An increasing number of utilities and companies are incorporating
hydrogen fuel into their portfolios and long-term business plans. At
the roundtable, Toyota brought its hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered Mirai
passenger car. Tech start-up Hydrostar brought a demonstration of a low
cost electrolyzer that can use renewable energy to create 100 percent
renewable hydrogen. The Eugene (Oregon) Water and Electric Board is
looking at innovative plans to use hydrogen to store surplus renewable
energy as emergency backup power during natural disasters.
California is nurturing the use of hydrogen fuel-powered vehicles
by co-funding hydrogen refueling stations. There are now more than 30
hydrogen fueling stations powering the more than 4,200 hydrogen fuel
cars in the state. The federal government must follow California's lead
and propel the growth of hydrogen fuel technologies. Like wind and
solar, the federal government can provide various tools to help this
technology reach economies of scale, reduce its price, and make it more
available to the public.
As I noted, it is immoral and unethical for policy makers to
abandon our duty to leave a sustainable planet. Our nation's youth
rightly demand that the government has a constitutional duty to protect
them from the existential threat of climate change. Which is why in
February, I was one of seven members of Congress to send a ``friend of
the court'' brief to support the plaintiffs in the Juliana vs. United
States to the court in support of their argument. Three of the
plaintiffs are from my district; once again Oregon leads the way.
Let me be clear: I will not stand by as our earth lurches toward a
state that cannot support life. I am open to any and all ideas to
overcome our climate crisis. One thing is certain: we cannot give up.
We don't have to. We already have solutions that will put us on the
road to lower carbon emissions, we just need the political will to act.
You can count on me to continue working to end the most critical issue
facing our world.
Thank you again for holding today's hearing.
Ms. Castor. Well, fortunately, we have you as the chairman
of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to help us.
You know, so much of the dialogue around the climate crisis
involves the challenges ahead, but I think what you have been
able to do through your work and your testimony today is
highlight the opportunities, the opportunities for families,
hardworking families across the country to save money, to build
these new innovative technologies. So we will look forward to
working with you and your professional staff, all of your
committee members on charting that course forward.
Mr. DeFazio. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Ms. Castor. Thank you very much.
And, Mr. Schneider, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. BRADLEY SCOTT SCHNEIDER, A REPRESENTATIVE
IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS
Mr. Schneider. Thank you, Madam Chair. And I want to thank
you for your leadership on this committee and the work you are
doing, and then today, for the opportunity to testify before
you.
Congress must urgently address climate change because
climate change is not a future threat. As others have said, it
is a very real and present danger. On nearly weekly basis we
see news of catastrophic climate events, including Category 5
hurricanes and typhoons, more widespread floods, record-setting
tornadoes, and longer and more devastating fire seasons. This
is true in the United States, but also around the world. The
need for bold action is now. The decisions we make today will
determine the future we pass on to our children and will
determine the future of our way of life on this planet.
In that vein, I want to highlight four general topics.
First, the idea that comprehensive congressional response to
climate change is necessary. Addressing impacts and crafting
solutions extends beyond the single jurisdiction of any one
congressional committee. It affects our national domestic
security, it impacts communities both urban and rural, it
threatens our national energy grid, our emergency response
capacity, transportation infrastructure. Rising seas pose new
risks to coastal communities and naval bases. Changing weather
patterns threaten farms and, therefore, food security, not just
here at home, but around the world. It is placing new demands
on our foreign policy and our international aid.
Because the challenges are so multifaceted, the tools we
will need, from tax incentives to spur development to
assistance for vulnerable communities, will necessarily come
from every corner of government. This is why I believe that
every committee in Congress should charge and empower one of
its standing subcommittees to address climate-related policy
within its jurisdiction. This assignment should be reflected in
the subcommittee's name. To properly address climate change, we
will need a whole-of-government approach and all hands on deck.
Congress must approach the issue with the same level of
thoroughness.
The second topic deals with resiliency that others have
talked about as well. In this, as in previous Congresses, we
are pushing for Federal investment in our Nation's
infrastructure. We have the opportunity to spur investment in
infrastructure through regularly authorized legislation like
that governing surface transportation that we will address in
this Congress, as well as through more comprehensive
infrastructure packages that I hope we will address and,
hopefully, pass in this Congress.
As we look at these opportunities to make significant
Federal investments in infrastructure around the country, we
must ensure that these investments are made with the long-term
impacts of climate change in mind. In my own district, for
instance, we have seen the effect of climate change firsthand
through increased rainfall and flooding in recent years,
challenging our storm water infrastructure. We must make sure
that our future investments in infrastructure are prepared to
handle the capacity and ongoing demands climate change will
bring from increased natural disasters to adapting to the needs
of an electrical grid run by renewables.
Third, with respect to natural disaster funding. Climate
change has already significantly increased dangerous and
damaging natural disasters around the world, including six
Category 5 hurricanes in the last 4 years, the first ever
extreme red flag warning for wildfires in California, and the
increasingly common occurrence of so-called 100- and even 500-
year floods.
There are vital Federal programs that help communities
prepare for and respond to these disasters, but we know that
these programs will be stretched thin as climate change
exacerbates the cost and frequency of these events. I believe
this committee must make sure funding for natural disasters is
examined through the lens of climate change so that we can be
sure future events have adequate funding prepared to respond.
Finally, the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative. As my
colleague Marcy Kaptur spoke earlier about the effects of
climate change and algal blooms in Lake Erie, we are seeing
impacts across every great lake, and we must look to existing,
successful Federal programs to address local and regional
climate-related issues. The Great Lakes Restoration Initiative
has been a successful Federal program that promotes
conservation, stewardship, and environmental programming in the
Great Lakes region.
As this committee looks for ways to address regionally
specific concerns stemming from climate change, I encourage you
to look at the Great Lakes Restoration Initiative as a means of
addressing Great Lakes issues specifically and to follow the
successful partnership model of the GLRI more generally when
considering new programs.
Again, I want to emphasize that addressing climate change
will require an all-of-government response. I look forward to
working with my colleagues on this committee to chart a more
sustainable and prosperous future for our planet and to tackle
with the fierce urgency this issue requires.
Thank you very much. I yield back.

Testimony of the Hon. Bradley ``Brad'' Schneider
A Representative in Congress from the State of Illinois
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you, Madam Chair, for the opportunity to testify. And thank
you for the leadership of this committee. Congress must address climate
change with the dire urgency the situation requires, because climate
change is not a future threat, it is a present danger. On a near weekly
basis we see news of catastrophic floods, record setting tornadoes, and
longer and more devastating fire seasons.
The need for urgent action is now. The decisions we make today will
determine the future we pass on to our children.
Subcommittee
Climate change is a global problem that evades the single
jurisdiction of just one congressional committee. It affects our
natural resources, our national energy grid, our emergency response,
transportation infrastructure, foreign policy, and more. And the tools
we'll need--from tax incentives to spur development to assistance for
vulnerable communities--come from every corner of government.
I propose that every committee in Congress empower one of its
subcommittees to address climate-related policy within its
jurisdiction. To properly address climate change, we will need a whole-
of-government approach and for all hands on deck. Congress must
approach the issue with the same level of thoroughness.
Resiliency
In this as in previous Congresses, we are pushing for federal
investment in our nation's infrastructure. We have the opportunity to
spur investment in infrastructure through regularly authorized
legislation like that governing surface transportation that we will

packages like that which we all hope we can pass this Congress.
As we look at these opportunities to make significant federal
investments in infrastructure around the country, we must ensure that
these investments are made with climate change in mind. In my own
district, for instance, we have seen climate change first-hand through
increased rainfall and flooding in recent decades, challenging our
stormwater infrastructure. We must make sure that our future
investments in infrastructure are prepared to handle the capacity and
demands climate change will bring--from increased natural disasters to
adapting to the needs of an electrical grid run by renewables.
Natural Disaster Funding
Climate change has already significantly increased dangerous and

Warning for wildfires, and the increasingly common occurrence of the
so-called ``100-year'' floods.
There are vital federal programs that help communities prepare for

stretched thin as climate change exacerbates the cost and frequency of

natural disasters is examined through the lens of climate change so
that we can be sure future events have adequate funding prepared to

GLRI
Finally, we must look to existing, successful federal programs to
address local and regional climate-related issues. The Great Lakes
Restoration Initiative has been a successful federal program that
promotes conservation, stewardship, and environmental programming in
the Great Lakes Region. As this Committee looks for ways to address
regionally-specific concerns stemming from climate change, I encourage
you to look at GLRI as a means of addressing Great Lakes issues
specifically, and to follow the successful partnership model of GLRI
more generally when considering new programs.
Addressing climate change will require an all of government
response. I look forward to working with my colleagues on this
committee to chart a more sustainable and prosperous future for our
planet, and to address this with the fierce urgency the issue requires.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you very much, Mr. Schneider.
Mr. Peters, you are my colleague from the Energy and
Commerce Committee. I know that these issues have been of
interest to you from the time before you entered the Congress,
so I am pleased that you have recommendations for the select
committee. You are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. SCOTT H. PETERS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Mr. Peters. Thank you so much, Madam Chair. And thank you
for your pivotal leadership on this crisis today.
You know, we now well understand climate change. We have
many of the tools at our disposal that we need to deal with
climate change. We know the target net-zero by mid-century, but
we cannot get to where we need to be without dramatic and
substantive policy change. We need to tackle that now.
Some argue that what we need is the Green New Deal. While I
agree with just about every policy in the Green New Deal that
has to do with climate, it also calls for major expensive
societal overhauls, like a Federal jobs' guarantee and free
college for every American, and we could debate those policies
separately without burdening the already daunting task of
climate action with these extra requirements. And that was the
point that Greta Thunberg made recently when she came to
Capitol Hill. She said we need to keep our eyes on the ball,
quote.
Yes, of course, a sustainable transformed world will
include lots of new benefits, but you have to understand, this
is not primarily an opportunity to create new green jobs, new
businesses, or green economic growth. This is above all an
emergency, and not just any emergency. This is the biggest
crisis humanity has ever faced.
So it is not responsible for us in Congress to pretend that
a one-party, nonbinding resolution that itself enacts not a
single legislative change or any one-party bill that cannot
become law is the answer to this question. Great challenges
like sending a man to the Moon or winning a world war against
tyranny or fighting climate change to save the planet are one
with national unity and consensus. Great challenges don't wait
for or depend on the results of the next election. We need to
work together now across party lines if we want our children
and grandchildren to have a habitable planet, and we have some
great opportunities that I want to point out. Some of the
context has changed.
At the Energy and Commerce Committee this April, even EPA
Administrator Wheeler testified that climate change is real and
that it is driven by human activity, including the burning of
fossil fuels. That is not exactly climate change denial.
Florida Republicans Francis Rooney, Brian Mast, and Matt Gaetz
are all sponsors of legitimate climate legislation, because
Floridians have noticed the streets of Miami are flooded on
sunny days and they know why that is. And perhaps most
noteworthy for bringing about a change of opinion toward
climate among our Republican colleagues is the moral advocacy
of religious leaders like Pope Francis and the Evangelical
Environmental Network, which is prioritizing climate change
action because they believe we are called upon to take care of
God's creation.
So these trends present some new opportunities, and I have
been looking for bipartisan bills that actually pass. I
assembled a climate playbook from work we have already done,
over 90 bills, many of them are bipartisan, that we could take
action on soon. Many have already cleared their committees,
some have reached the floor. You have heard the New Democrat
Coalition has endorsed 12 bills, seven of them are bipartisan.
One of those bills is the USE IT Act, which I coauthored
with Dave McKinley from West Virginia. Bipartisan and
bicameral, it supports the development of and construction of
vital carbon capture and removal technologies as called for by
the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It also
invests in technologies to transform captured carbon dioxide
into commercial products, like Chairman DeFazio was talking
about.
Florida Republican Matt Gaetz and I introduced the
bipartisan Super Pollutants Act, which aims to regulate black
carbon, hydrofluorocarbons, and methane, some of the most
potent greenhouse gases, together worth a half a degree of
warming. Among other things, the bill would codify the new
source methane regulation that the Trump administration is
trying to kill and would incentivize and then mandate control
of methane from existing sources.
Elise Stefanik and I introduced the Renewable Electricity
Tax Credit Equalization Act, which would extend tax credits for
investments and qualify renewable biomass, geothermal, solid
waste, and hydropower so that we can develop new renewable
baseload power that can replace fossil fuels.
We have introduced the DISASTER Act with Mark Meadows to
mandate the OMB to give us an accurate picture of Federal cost
for disaster response so we can understand the cost and
emphasize the need to act on climate. And you have already
heard about bipartisan efforts to advance a carbon fee, because
we generally accept that a price on carbon is an indispensable
component of an effective climate action strategy,
incentivizing every business consumer and family to reduce
their own carbon footprint.
With all these challenges, what is the right policy
approach? I am for the ones that might actually become law, and
I hope the committee agrees because there is no time to waste,
there is no election to wait for. We need to work now to save
this planet.
Again, thank you very much for your work.

There is no time to waste.
We have some openings in the Congress to get real, bipartisan,
science-based legislation passed. Let's seize them.
At the Energy and Commerce Committee this April, EPA Administrator
Wheeler testified that climate change is real and that it is driven by
human activity, including use of fossil fuels. Florida Republicans
Francis Rooney, Brian Mast and Matt Gaetz are all cosponsors of
legitimate climate legislation. Floridians have noticed the streets of

Perhaps most noteworthy for bringing about a change of opinion
toward climate among Republicans is the moral advocacy of religious
leaders. Pope Francis issued an encyclical declaring climate change is
``both the cry of the earth and the cry of the poor.''
The Evangelical Environmental Network is prioritizing climate
change action, because they believe we are called upon to take care of
God's creation. These trends present new opportunities for not just the
usual suspects, but for actual change.
I assembled a Climate Playbook, which lays out over 90 bills
authored by Democrats and Republicans in recent years, most of which
already have bipartisan support. Many have already passed through their
committees of jurisdiction and some have passed the full House. It's a
resource we update as ideas are written into legislation, and as bills
advance. It's hosted on my web site and available to everyone.
One of these bills is the (USE IT) Act, which I coauthored with
Dave McKinley. It's bipartisan and bicameral and supports the
development and construction of vital carbon capture and removal
technologies as called for by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate

the Trump Administration is trying to kill, and would incentivize, then

New York Republican Elise Stefanik and I introduced the Renewable

investments in qualified renewable biomass, geothermal, solid waste and
hydropower, so that we can develop new renewable baseload power that
could replace fossil fuels. The DISASTER Act, which I introduced with
Rep. Mark Meadows, mandates the OMB to give us an accurate picture of
federal costs for disaster response, so we can understand the costs and
we can emphasize the need to act on climate.
Related to our clean energy future, Rep. Elaine Luria and Rob
Wittman have introduced the Nuclear Energy Leadership Act, which has
the DOE demonstrate advanced nuclear plants, develop the fuel needed
for this technology, and write a 10-year strategic plan for advanced
nuclear reactor development.
Finally, there are two bipartisan efforts to advance a carbon fee:
the MARKET CHOICE Act and Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act. We
generally accept that a price on carbon is an indispensable component
of an effective climate action plan, incentivizing every business,
consumer and family to reduce their own carbon footprint.
Great challenges like sending a man to the moon, or winning a world
war against tyranny, or fighting climate change to save the planet are
won with national unity and consensus. Great challenges don't wait for
or depend on the next election results. We need to work together now,
across party lines, if we want our children and our grandchildren to

So, what's the right policy approach? I'm for the ones that might
actually become law, and I hope the Committee agrees, there is no time
to waste.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you, Mr. Peters. You know, I guess
it was a little over a year ago you said you were going to keep
track of every climate bill that was filed in this Congress,
and your climate playbook has become an invaluable resource. So
thank you very much. Thank you for your testimony today.
Ms. Axne, we want to hear about the Iowa story. Since you
arrived in the Congress, you have been an outspoken advocate
for your State and what is happening there in the
transformation to clean energy. So you are recognized for 5
minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. CYNTHIA AXNE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF IOWA
Mrs. Axne. Well, thank you so much Chairwoman Castor,
Ranking Member Graves, and members of the Select Committee.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify here today, and thanks
for all the work that you have done to push this agenda
forward.
As we all know, climate change is a real existential
threat, and the impacts of climate change, as you are implying,
don't just affect our coast, but they also affect the heartland
with changing weather patterns and devastating floods, and it
is only going to get worse and impact our economy if we don't
act.
My district experienced this pain firsthand just this year.
Earlier this year, the Midwest suffered historic flooding on
the Missouri River and put entire towns like Hamburg and
Pacific Junction in my district completely under water. We
still have 4 feet of water in many places with white caps
flowing on it this many months later.
Not only did it cause pain and destruction, but it caused
billions of dollars of damage in agricultural losses throughout
Iowa, and now we are experiencing these historic so-called 100-
or 500-year floods on a fairly regular basis. It is also been
the wettest year on record for Iowans, which has made flood
recovery even more difficult and has greatly affected our
harvest. So the effects of climate change can't be ignored in
places like Iowa.
So the situation in my district underscores the urgency of
what we are hear to talk about today and, of course, why
Congress must address the climate crisis with substantial
legislation that will move us toward a cleaner environmental
future. We simply can't afford to get this wrong, and we must
work collaboratively with all stakeholders in both rural and
urban communities to achieve meaningful results.
I come from the great Third District of Iowa. It is a row
crop State in the heartland where agriculture and our rural
communities are literally essential to who we are. Farmers
quite often get a bad rap on environmental issues, but that is
simply misguided. While we all can and must do more to address
this crisis, farmers in my State and district have been on the
forefront of this issue because the environment is their
livelihood.
We have seen farmers adopt scientific solutions,
technological advances, and groundbreaking innovations to
improve the health of their land and become more efficient,
while reducing their footprint, like precision agriculture
practices that address every single inch of land and what is
specifically needed for an input on that piece of land. In
fact, over the last 70 years, farms have nearly tripled in
production while inputs have stayed the same, so Iowans are
feeding more with less, and this increased efficiency has also
allowed farmers to grow crops to be converted into renewable
biofuels.
These biofuels have helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions
in the transportation sector, which we have indicated here is
the leading industry for carbon emissions. Compared to
petroleum, biodiesel reduces GHG emissions by upwards of 72
percent. And in 2018 alone, biofuels reduced GHG emissions
equivalent to taking 17 million cars off the road. So the
renewable fuel standard is an essential program to help us
reduce our emissions, and Congress must support the biofuels
industry to continue this.
Farmers have also implemented several conservation programs
with success, like the Conservation Reserve Program, the
Environmental Quality Incentives Program, and the Conservation
Stewards Program. Between those programs, we have 132 million
acres enrolled, which is 15 percent of all agricultural land in
the country. And additionally, I am very proud of this, Iowa
leads the Nation in conservation tillage acres and is fifth in
no-tillage practices.
So it all goes to show that farmers are already working
hard to implement conservation practices that help our
environment. But farmers are also facing really hard times
right now between low years of commodity prices, a trade war
that continues to threaten our market access, and unpredictable
weather that harms production. So any additional conservation
program should be modeled after the current ones and provide
financial support and incentives.
There is also significant advances to be made with carbon
sequestration. We should look at opportunities to promote
practices that result in the greatest amount of carbon being
sequestered and incentivize the implementation of those
practices. I am proud of the work that the Iowa Soybean
Association is doing in developing a soil and water outcomes
fund that would provide financial incentives for farmers and
monetize the carbon capture. And I encourage the select
committee to look into the important work they are doing and
look for opportunities that Congress can support.
We must also recognize the importance of rural broadband in
this conversation, because as farmers continue to innovate and
adapt groundbreaking precision agriculture technologies, they
can have a significant impact on addressing the issues with
climate change. So investing in rural communities allows for
further deployment of wind and solar technologies as well. I
have been there. I was in charge of implementing the governor's
agenda for clean energy in the environment in Iowa. We now have
over 9,000 jobs in that industry and almost 40 percent of our
energy is there, so we ask you to continue to look at the
Midwest to support these ideas.
Chairwoman Castor, you couldn't have said it any better
during the opening remarks of the select committee's hearing on
agriculture last month when you said farmers are already doing
a lot to combat climate crisis and we must invest in them to do
more.
So to finish this up, I am asking Congress to enact
meaningful legislation to address climate crisis, but we have
got to get our answers right, and that means working with
partners in every sector, in every community to build upon a
success they have and invest in new opportunities for carbon
reduction.
Thanks again for letting me testify here today, and I
really look forward to hearing your recommendations.

Chairwoman Castor, Ranking Member Graves, and Members of the Select
Committee--thank you for the opportunity to testify here today, and
thank you all for the work you have done on this important committee.
Climate change is a real and existential threat. The impacts of
climate change aren't just felt on the coasts with rising sea levels,
but are also felt in the Heartland with changing weather patterns and
devastating floods. Climate change is already impacting America's
economy, and it will only get worse if we don't act.
My district has experienced this pain first hand. Earlier this
year, the Midwest suffered historic flooding of the Missouri River that
put entire towns such as Hamburg and Pacific Junction in my district
completely underwater.
The flooding caused pain and destruction for many of my
constituents and caused billions of dollars in damage and agricultural
losses throughout Iowa.
We are experiencing these historic, so-called 100 or 500 year
floods far too often. This year was also the wettest year on record for
Iowans, which has made flood recovery even more difficult and has
greatly affected harvest. The effects of climate change cannot be
ignored.
This situation in my district underscores the urgency of what we're
here to talk about today. This Congress must address the climate crisis
with substantial legislation that will move us towards a cleaner
environmental future. We simply cannot afford to get this wrong, and we
must work collaboratively with all stakeholders in both rural and urban
communities to achieve meaningful results.
I come from the Third District of Iowa, a row crop state in the
heartland, where agriculture and our rural communities are essential to
who we are. Farmers often get a bad rap on environmental issues, but
that is simply misguided.
While we all can and must do more to address this crisis, farmers
in my state and district have been on the forefront of this issue--the
environment is their livelihood.
We have seen farmers adopt scientific solutions, technological
advances, and groundbreaking innovations to improve the health of their
land and become more efficient while reducing their footprint. Like
precision agriculture practices that address what's needed on every
inch of land to use inputs in the most efficient way.
In fact, over the last seventy years farms have nearly tripled in
production while inputs have stayed the same. Iowans are feeding more
with less. This increased efficiency has also allowed farmers to grow
crops to be converted into renewable biofuels.
These biofuels have helped reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the
transportation sector, which as we all know is the leading industry for
carbon emissions. In 2018 alone, biofuels reduced green house gas
emissions equivalent to taking 17 million cars off the road.
Farmers have also successfully implemented conservation programs
such as Conservation Reserve Program, the Environmental Quality
Incentives Program, and the Conservation Stewards Program. Between
these three programs, more than 132 million acres--15% of all
agricultural land in the country--is enrolled in conservation
practices.
Additionally--and I'm very proud of this--Iowa leads the nation in
conservation tillage acres and is fifth in no-till acres.
This all goes to show that farmers are already working hard to
implement conservation practices that help our environment. However,
farmers are also facing hard times between years of low commodity
prices, a trade war that has threatened market access, and
unpredictable weather that has harmed production.
Any additional conservation programs should be modeled after the
current ones and provide financial support and incentives.
There are also significant advances to be made within carbon
sequestration. We should look at opportunities to promote practices
that result in the greatest amount of carbon being sequestered and
incentivize the implementation of such practices.
I am proud of the work that the Iowa Soybean Association is doing
in developing a Soil and Water Outcomes Fund that would provide
financial incentive for farmers and monetize the carbon capture. I
encourage the Select Committee to look into the important work that
they are doing and look for opportunities for Congress to support.
We must also recognize the importance of rural broadband in this
conversation. As farmers continue to innovate and adapt groundbreaking
precision agriculture technologies--which has had significant effects
on tracking water quality issues and reducing inputs and energy needs
through efficiency--it is critical that our rural communities have the
infrastructure necessary to support new and emerging technology.
Investing in our rural communities also allows for further
deployment of wind and solar technologies. In my time working with the
State of Iowa, I helped implement the Governor's Agenda on Clean Energy
and the Environment. The initiative helped bring the wind industry to
scale in Iowa while also creating thousands of jobs.
Today, the wind industry supports over 9,000 jobs for Iowans and
generates nearly 40% of the state's electricity--among the highest in
the nation. We must continue to make investments in these clean
technologies.
Chairwoman Castor, you could not have said it any better during
your opening remarks of the Select Committee's hearing on agriculture
last month when you said that farmers are already doing a lot to combat
the climate crisis and we must invest in them to do more.
That is what this comes down to--there is significant opportunity
to build upon the practices our farmers are already undertaking and
incentivize new research, technology, and practices to reduce our
carbon footprint--we need to invest in and encourage these
developments.
This Congress must act and pass meaningful legislation to address
the climate crisis and we must get our answer right. The stakes are
simply too high if we don't.
That means working with partners in every sector and in every
community, to build upon the success they already have, and invest in
new opportunities for carbon reduction.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify here today and I
look forward to the Select Committee's recommendations.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you very much, Representative Axne,
for your leadership, your know-how based upon your experience
in Iowa. We are going to need your help as we craft these
policy recommendations. So thank you.
Mrs. Axne. Thank you.
Ms. Castor. And speaking of a leader on climate is my
colleague from the Energy and Commerce Committee, who has for
many years been working on principles and climate solutions. So
to the chairman of the Environment and Climate Change
Subcommittee, welcome, thank you, Mr. Tonko, for being here.
You are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. PAUL TONKO, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF NEW YORK
Mr. Tonko. Thank you.
Well, good afternoon, Chair Castor. And as chair and
certainly as the members of the select committee gather, we
thank you for this opportunity to testify and for all your work
to advance meaningful and necessary climate action. So thank
you, Chair Castor.
The scale and scope of this crisis demand an all-hands-on-
deck approach. Much like the select committee, the House Energy
and Commerce Committee has been holding hearings and
stakeholder roundtables to better understand what
opportunities, what challenges, and what potential solutions
should be considered as part of comprehensive legislation. As a
precursor to these hearings, I undertook a year's long process
meeting with hundreds of stakeholders and seeking their
perspectives and their policy priorities. This input proved
critically important to developing a set of nine principles for
climate action, which were released earlier this year. I will
not go through that entire framework today, but I do hope the
committee will consider it as a helpful rubric for building and
evaluating comprehensive climate proposals. And you have
received copies of this, and, you know, I think it proves
helpful.
This process has also revealed several insights that may be
useful to you now. Our next step must be to draw from areas of
agreement and build specific policies and legislative language.
Most importantly, we need a broad portfolio of solutions. No
one policy will decarbonize the entire economy on its own. The
transition to a clean economy will create opportunities that
can benefit American workers, can benefit families and
communities if we act quickly and thoughtfully. But our
approach must also acknowledge challenges.
First, it must provide fairness and opportunities for
workers and a transition plan for communities and individuals
that face disruptions. Second, we must ensure that the
transition works for all Americans and that it addresses
historic inequities and environmental injustices. Third, we
must maintain energy affordability to avoid harming America's
most vulnerable populations. Fourth, we need to restore and
strengthen the United States' competitiveness, particularly in
domestic manufacturing.
Regarding specific solutions, I am certain we have heard
many of the same suggestions; therefore, it might be useful to
mention a few aspects that might be overlooked or
underappreciated. In power, no credible modeler believes we can
achieve 80 percent or more clean electricity with our existing
infrastructure alone. We need to build more transmission, we
need to reduce regulatory barriers that cause new lines to take
a decade to build, and increase the capacity and efficiency of
our existing lines. This will not be politically popular, but
it is indeed necessary.
In transportation, we should electrify as much as possible,
but there are limitations that require us to develop other
clean alternatives. Hydrogen fuel cells have great potential,
especially for long-haul trucking that benefits from fast
refueling without the heavyweight of batteries. Similarly,
cleaner liquid fuels will likely be needed for aviation. We
must continue investing in R&D and encouraging market demand
for these alternatives.
For industry, regardless of your feelings on CCS and the
power sector, carbon capture for certain types of industrial
facilities will likely be necessary. Again, raising demand for
low emissions industrial products can be a major driver for
innovation. Amongst economywide mechanisms, carbon pricing is a
potentially powerful part of our toolkit. A strong price signal
will spur investment and innovation and low emissions
alternatives, but not all carbon pricing programs are created
equally. Good design matters and successful programs can take
different approaches.
Whether we are considering a tax, a fee, or emissions
trading system, first and foremost, it must provide emissions
reductions certainty. Second, the best result will come from
covering as much of the economy as technically and politically
feasible, while being technologically inclusive. Third, the
program must be credible and provide certainty in order to
impact long-term investment decisions. Fourth, it should
provide flexibility for regulated entities to the extent that
it does not undermine the integrity of the program or result in
harmful inequitable outcomes. Fifth, it must protect low-income
households as well as the global competitiveness of U.S. energy
intensive trade exposed manufacturers. And finally, at least
some revenues must go toward complementary policies that
promote R&D, infrastructure deployment, workforce development,
community and worker programs, environmental justice and
restoration resilience, and energy efficiency. These types of
investments will help make emissions reductions both quicker
and cheaper.
Ten years have passed since Congress last attempted
comprehensive climate legislation. If our intention is to avoid
the most dangerous and irreversible aspects of climate change,
our next opportunity to confront this crisis will likely be our
last.
I am eager to work with your committee, this committee, and
any member interested in ensuring this attempt succeeds. And
again, thank you for the opportunity to testify, and thank you,
again, for your leadership on this issue.

10 years have passed since Congress last attempted comprehensive

will likely be our last.
I am eager to work with this Committee and any member interested in

Thank you again for the opportunity to testify.
Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mr. Tonko.
Congresswoman Shalala, thank you very much for the
opportunity to be with you and local leaders in Miami, Miami
Beach last week. I was so impressed with what you are leading
when it comes to resiliency.
You are recognized for 5 minutes. I am anxious to hear your
testimony.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. DONNA E. SHALALA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA
Ms. Shalala. Thank you very much, Madam Chair, and thank
you for coming to South Florida.
Since 1950, the sea level in South Florida has risen eight
inches and it is only speeding up. By 2030, the sea level in
South Florida is projected to rise up to 12 inches, and by
2100, perhaps 80 inches. According to U.N. projections, the
average temperature on the planet will rise by 5 to 9 degrees
Fahrenheit by the end of the century. This will cause a sea
level rise that will virtually submerge all of South Florida.
If we continue to do nothing on climate change, my
community, Chairwoman Castor's Florida community as we know it,
will disappear. We have a moral obligation to mitigate and
adapt immediately as we are already seeing the effects of
climate change and sea level rise.
It no longer takes a strong hurricane to flood our streets.
They now flood just from a particular high tide such as the
king tides. In fact, tidal flooding has become three times as
common in South Florida in just the past 19 years, causing so-
called sunny-day flooding, affecting our streets, our schools,
our tourism economy.
Ninety percent of South Florida's drinking water comes from
the underground Biscayne aquifer. Because of Florida's porous
limestone bedrock and the diversion of fresh water ways, as sea
levels rise, saltwater reaches further inland and our drinking
water is seriously threatened. If we do not address sea level
rise through infrastructure, this saltwater intrusion will
destroy our only source of drinking water long before Miami is
under water.
With more powerful storms causing more destruction than
ever before, Category 4 and 5 hurricanes are projected to be at
least 45 percent more common because of rising ocean
temperatures. Combined with higher sea levels, when these
storms make landfall, they don't just flood roads and stop
traffic; they destroy homes and lives. But with thorough
legislation from this committee, we can combat rising sea
levels and a warming planet by crafting and pushing forward
with legislation to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis.
We can reduce emissions and transition away from fossil fuels
so that we can leave a healthy planet to future generations.
For those on this committee who also sit on the
Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, my testimony
likely sounds very similar to the one I gave to the committee
on Member day in the spring. That is because, particularly for
my constituents, addressing the climate crisis means addressing
our crumbling climate change exacerbating infrastructure. We
have a real opportunity to use climate-smart infrastructure to
prepare for higher sea levels, mitigate the effects of climate
change, and protect our communities.
So I ask my colleagues on the select committee to make sea
level rise and climate-resilient infrastructure a fundamental
component of their climate legislation. We have already had
success designing effective infrastructure projects in Miami.
In my district, as you well know, Madam Chair, as you visited
us last week, the city of Miami Beach has spent a half a
billion dollars on raising streets, building seawalls, and
installing massive water pumps that can move 30,000 gallons of
water a minute from streets into the ocean, draining over 7
inches of water a day. The city bond rating was maintained
because of these resilience efforts.
Combining these projects with natural green infrastructure
can result even better and more environmentally friendly
results. Miami Waterkeeper, a nonprofit organization that
advocates for South Florida's watershed and wildlife, is
working to address climate change and sea level rise locally by
promoting green infrastructure. And North Bay Village, also in
my district, is testing modular seawalls and encouraging the
private market to take the first step in raising the elevation
of this island community.
I have always believed that the Federal Government should
pay close attention to what is happening at the local level,
but it is really on to us in Washington to be partners for
local and State governments. We can't wait. My district and
many others are already seeing the disastrous effects of sea
level rise. This is not the time for incrementalism. We need a
big, bold strategy, so let's do it.
Thank you very much.

Testimony of the Hon. Donna Shalala
A Representative in Congress from the State of Florida
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Chairwoman Castor, Ranking Member Graves, and Committee members,
thank you for the invitation to testify on the issues of importance to
my constituents as the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis continues
to develop its legislative agenda.
I want to begin by giving you some numbers:
Since 1950, the sea level in South Florida has risen 8 inches, and
it is only speeding up. By 2030, the sea level in South Florida is
projected to rise up to 12 inches, and by 2100, perhaps 80 inches.
According to UN projections, the average temperature on the planet
will rise by 5 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the century. This
will cause a sea level rise that will virtually submerge all of South
Florida.
If we continue to do nothing on climate change, my community,
Chairwoman Castor's Florida community, as we know it, will disappear.
We have a moral obligation to mitigate and adapt immediately, as we
are already seeing the effects of climate change and sea level rise.
It no longer takes a strong hurricane to flood our streets; they
now flood just from a particularly high tide--such as the King tides.
In fact, tidal flooding has become three times as common in South
Florida in just the past 19 years, causing so-called sunny day flooding
affecting our streets, our schools, our tourism economy.
90 percent of South Florida's drinking water comes from the
underground Biscayne Aquifer.
Because of Florida's porous limestone bedrock and the diversion of
fresh waterways, as sea levels rise, salt water reaches further inland
and our drinking water is seriously threatened.
If we do not address sea level rise through infrastructure, this
salt water intrusion will destroy our only source of drinking water
long before Miami is underwater.
With more powerful storms causing more destruction than ever
before, category 4 and 5 hurricanes are projected to be at least 45%
more common because of rising ocean temperatures.
Combined with higher sea levels, when these storms make landfall,
they don't just flood roads and stop traffic, they destroy homes and
lives.
But with thorough legislation from this Committee, we can combat
rising sea levels and a warming planet by crafting and pushing forward
with legislation to mitigate the effects of the climate crisis.
Perhaps more importantly, we can reduce emissions and transition
away from fossil fuels, so we can leave a healthy planet to future
generations.
For those on this committee who also sit on the Transportation and
Infrastructure Committee, my testimony likely sounds very similar to
the one I gave at that committee's Member Day in the spring.
That's because, particularly for my constituents, addressing the
climate crisis means addressing our crumbling, climate change-
exacerbating infrastructure.
We have a real opportunity to use climate-smart infrastructure to
prepare for higher sea levels, mitigate the effects of climate change,
and protect our communities.
So I ask my colleagues on the Select Committee on the Climate
Crisis to make sea level rise and climate resilient infrastructure a
fundamental component of their climate legislation.
We have already had success designing effective infrastructure
projects in Miami that are actionable and scalable to the national
level.
In my district, as Chairwoman Castor knows well because she visited
us last week, the City of Miami Beach spent $500 million installing
massive water pumps that can move 30,000 gallons of water a minute from
streets into the ocean, draining over 7 inches of water a day.
Combining these projects with natural ``green'' infrastructure can
result in even better--and more environmentally friendly--results.
Miami Waterkeeper, a non-profit organization that advocates for
South Florida's watershed and wildlife, is working to address climate
change and sea level rise locally by promoting green infrastructure and
natural defenses, such as coral reefs, mangroves, and dunes.
North Bay Village, also in my district, is taking an innovative
approach, encouraging the private market to take the first step in
raising the elevation of this island community, as much of the
waterfront property is privately owned.
I've always believed that the federal government should pay close
attention to what's happening at the local level. In my district, on
the front lines of climate change, local governments and organizations
are leading the way, with innovative approaches to tackle one of the
most consequential issues we face.
It's on us, here in Washington, to take the giant steps in pushing
our country towards a 100% clean energy economy, but we can't forget to
look to what's happening at the ground level to address this crisis.
Ultimately, this Committee has the opportunity to address the
climate crisis and protect communities across the country by
integrating projects such as these into your bills.
We cannot wait. My district, and many others, are already seeing
the disastrous effects of sea level rise, as homes and lives are
destroyed by flooding and storms.
Our children cannot wait.
Thank you for addressing climate change and sea level rise with the
seriousness it demands.
Ms. Castor. Great. Well, thank you, again. You are
absolutely right, that is what I heard from community leaders
with you in Miami Beach. They want a better Federal partner, so
thank you very much. And I bet the former mayor of Phoenix
would echo those comments.
Mr. Stanton, you bring a great deal of expertise to the
halls of the Congress. You are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. GREG STANTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ARIZONA
Mr. Stanton. Thank you very much, Chair Castor. Thank you
for your leadership on this critically important select
committee. Thank you for allowing me to participate in today's
hearing. I look forward to your visit to Arizona, because
climate change is ravaging the American Southwest. Arizona is
getting hotter and dryer and more vulnerable to disaster. It is
screaming out for Congress to do something for those of us in a
position of power to take action.
My home State of Arizona has earned headlines for its
ranking as one of the fastest growing States in the Nation, but
I am concerned about another ranking, though: that Arizona is
the third fastest warming State in the country. Since 1970,
temperatures have risen 3.2 degrees in Arizona. In the cities
of Tucson and Phoenix, temperatures have risen 4.5 and 4.4
degrees, respectively. They rank as the third and fourth
fastest warming cities in America.
In the West, water is becoming more and more scarce. In
Arizona, we are in our 19th year of drought. The federally
funded National Climate Assessment found that rising global
temperatures have changed the southwest water cycle and
decreased snowpack. Less snowpack, of course, means less water.
That changing water cycle has created an alarming situation on
the Colorado River, which provides water to Arizona,
California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah. The
Colorado River supplies the City of Phoenix with 40 percent of
its water, but its future is in peril.
The once mighty river has experienced severe drought
conditions since the time of the Clinton administration. Today,
it remains dangerously overallocated, chronically overused, and
is on the verge of collapse. The lack of water is forcing
severe change in the southwest forest ecosystems and
agricultural centers. Wildfires are becoming more frequent,
more intense, more destructive, and more deadly. A recent study
cited by the National Climate Assessment compared total acres
burned in western forests under current climate conditions and
without human-caused warming. It found that between 1984 and
2015, the area burned by wildfire was double what it would have
been without rising temperatures. As a result, wildfires have
burned more than 1.5 million pine forest acres in Arizona.
Climate change is hurting farmers, growers, and ranchers
too. For the agricultural industry, which has more than a $23
billion economic impact in Arizona, rising temperatures and
water scarcity will change where crops can grow and endanger
the health of livestock, all of which has the potential to
displace growers and ranchers, impacting rural communities in
my State and across the southwest. Not only is our environment
being impacted by the effects of climate change, those in the
southwest will suffer more health risks as well, including
increased risk of exposure to infectious diseases, heatstroke,
and more allergy problems.
Cities across the United States are doing their part to
combat climate change by embracing public transit, energy
efficient buildings, making direct investments in clean,
renewable energy. I am proud that when I left my post recently
as mayor of the city of Phoenix, we had passed a $31 billion
plan to expand the city's light rail system, we installed 32
megawatts of solar energy on city-owned sites, we built one of
the largest municipal fleet of clean energy vehicles in the
country, we replaced Phoenix city vehicles with vehicles that
run on alternative fuel or electric batteries. Every city
garbage truck uses alternative fuels. Three-quarters of the
city's buses run on natural gas, but it is time for the Federal
Government to step up and take bold action to address it as
well.
One easy thing we can do is to support our local
governments by passing the legislation that Congressman Marc
Veasey and I have introduced, H.R. 2088, to reauthorize the
Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program. It is a
simple reauthorization. This would create jobs, help consumers
save on their energy bills, and reduce carbon pollution. In
fact, a national evaluation of the Program's effectiveness
found that just 1 year of funding avoided the emission of 25.7
million metric tons of carbon equivalent. Imagine what would
happen if we provided funding for this program over several
years.
When this program was last funded, State and local
governments were able to pursue a wide range of projects, from
energy retrofits to deployment of LED street lighting and solar
energy systems, to EV charging stations and alternative fuel
pumps. These same cities and communities, backed by the U.S.
Conference of Mayors and the National League of Cities, support
reauthorizing this program, just one of many policy ideas that
this committee will hear about and many others that, of course,
you will be considering. And I urge this committee to act with
the urgency that the crisis demands before it is too late.
Thank you so much. I yield back.

I'm proud that when I left my post as mayor of Phoenix, we had
passed a $31 billion plan to expand the city's light rail system. We
had installed 32 mega-watts of solar energy on city-owned sites. We
built one of the largest municipal fleet of clean-energy vehicles in
the country. We replaced Phoenix city vehicles with vehicles that run
on alternative fuels or electric batteries. Every city garbage truck
uses alternative fuels. Three-quarters of city buses run on natural
gas.
But it is time for the federal government to step up and take bold
action to address it as well.
One easy thing we can do to support our local governments is pass
legislation Congressman Marc Veasey and I have introduced, H.R. 2088,
to reauthorize the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant
Program. It's a simple reauthorization. This would create jobs, help
consumers save on their energy bills, and reduce carbon pollution. In
fact, a national evaluation of the program's effectiveness found that
just one year of funding avoided the emission of 25.7 million metric
tons of carbon equivalent. Imagine what could happen if we provided
funding for this program over several years. When this program was last
funded, state and local governments were able to pursue a wide range of
projects from energy retrofits to deployment of LED street lighting and
solar energy systems to EV charging stations and alternative fuel
pumps. These same cities and communities, backed by the U.S. Conference
of Mayors and the National League of Cities, support reauthorization of
this program.
This is just one of many policy ideas that this committee will hear
about and there are many others you should consider. I urge this
committee to act with the urgency that this crisis demands before it is
too late.
Ms. Castor. Outstanding. Thank you so much.
Ms. Pingree, thank you for your leadership, especially your
attendance at our last hearing. You are recognized for 5
minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. CHELLIE PINGREE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MAINE
Ms. Pingree. Thank you very much, Madam Chair. Thank you
for letting me attend that hearing. And thank you and the
entire committee for the incredible work that you are doing,
and also for letting us have this day where Members give their
input. Just as a little aside, I feel you look very regal there
in this committee room and that should be captured forever. We
will give you a wand and it will be done.
So I will submit my longer written testimony, but I just
want to summarize a few things while we are talking here today.
I want to just highlight some of the ways that climate crisis
is affecting my home State of Maine, as well as some of the
solutions that we are discussing and implementing. For Maine
and so many other communities across the Nation, as I have
heard listening to my colleagues speak, it is just not an
abstraction; it is a tangible threat to our communities, to the
people who live there.
Farmers in the State of Maine are being impacted by the
changing growing season and extreme weather events. The
productivity of our State forest is threatened by temperature
changes and invasive species. The ocean in the Gulf of Maine is
warming at a rate 99 percent faster than the rest of the world,
so you can imagine that we are frightened about that. Sea level
off of our coast is 8 inches higher than it was in 1950, and
continuing to rise at a rate of 1 inch every 8 years,
threatening homes and businesses.
Ocean acidification is yet another problem that we are
dealing with, but the good news is, earlier this year, the
Maine legislature and our brand-new Governor, Governor Mills,
enacted a sweeping bipartisan climate change bill that will put
us in the forefront of taking on many of these challenges. We
want to be ahead of the curve, and let me just tell you a
couple of ways we are doing that.
For the last 10 years, the University of Maine has led in
developing an economic way to harness renewable energy, and
last week, our Public Utilities Commission approved a contract
for Maine AquaVentus. This is the first of its kind floating
offshore wind pilot project which was developed at the
university. It is expected to provide a tremendous amount of
energy, but also $152 million in economic input and more than a
thousand jobs.
We have a lot of concerns about the ocean. We are doing a
tremendous amount of research at our universities and our
scientific institutions, whether it is about sea level rise or
the future of our lobsters. But let me tell you about just one
business that has taken this on themselves. One company noting
the changes in the oyster stock due in part to increasing
acidification where he farms, Bill Mook of Mook Sea Farm,
started adapting his business. He created a filtration system
to ensure appropriate pH levels are maintained to protect the
growing shellfish. He is also growing his own oyster food
through a unique heterotrophic method to produce algae. This
unique process differs from the industry standard phototrophic
process and reduces time, labor, and electrical cost, and most
importantly, allows him to adapt so that he can continue in
business.
Our forest industry has a lot of innovative programs going
on. We are the most forested State in the Nation, and we have
been working on a lot of renewable products made from wood,
including nanocellulose, which will be used in bioplastics and
fully recyclable materials, also cross-laminated timber, which
is now being used in buildings from 6 to 10 stories high. Far
more sustainable, less of a carbon footprint than steel or
cement.
As you know, I was lucky to attend your agriculture
hearing, and I have been working on this issue, in particular
myself, and working on a bill which I hope to share with your
committee and even more ideas. But I did start with a set of
principles. Those are to prioritize soil health initiatives, to
protect farmland and improve farm-viability, to support
pasture-based livestock systems, and invest in on-farm and
rural energy initiatives, and reduce food waste.
Let me just quickly tell you about a couple of those
projects that are going on in Maine. We just recently announced
OpenTEAM. It is a private-public partnership with the Wolfe's
Neck Center for Agriculture and Environment and Stonyfield
Organic, as well as research which comes from the Foundation
for Food and Agriculture Research, which receives their funding
through the farm bill. This will create a platform that farmers
can use and deal with the question that comes up frequently,
how do we measure the amount of carbon being sequestered in the
soil and how do we make sure farmers receive that award.
As many of my colleagues have mentioned, farmers are ahead
of the curve in many places. They can be an incredible ally in
helping us to sequester carbon, and we need to use them in
partnership in anything that we do.
Another interesting project is Exeter Agri-Energy. They
take the manure from a thousand cows, as well as the food waste
from our largest grocery store chain, they use an anaerobic
biodigester, and then they turn it into fertilizer bedding, but
more importantly, they convert it to electricity. They don't
have to use the natural gas pipelines, and it is an excellent
way both to deal with manure that is produced on farms as well
as food waste, which about 30 percent of the food is wasted in
this country, and we can't underestimate the challenges that
the methane that it produces provide to our environment.
You have a huge charge in front of you. I am so grateful
that this committee exists and the hard work that you are all
doing, and thank you for letting me give my input today.

Testimony of the Hon. Chellie Pingree
A Representative in Congress from the State of Maine
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you to Chairwoman Castor, Ranking Member Graves, and Members
of the Select Committee on the Climate Crisis for holding this Member's
Day event and for the opportunity to speak today. I would like to
highlight the ways the climate crisis is affecting my home state of
Maine, as well as discuss solutions being developed and implemented
there that can serve as models for other communities and are potential
areas for new or further federal investment.
For Maine and so many communities across our nation, climate change
is not an abstraction, but rather a tangible threat to local economies
and the people who live in them. Farmers are already being impacted by
changing growing seasons and extreme weather events. The productivity
of our state's forests is also threatened as the temperature changes
and invasive species outbreaks increase. Additionally, the ocean in the
Gulf of Maine is warming at a rate 99 percent faster than the rest of
the world. The sea level off our coast is 8 inches higher than it was
in 1950, and it is continuing to rise at the rate of about 1 inch every
8 years, threatening homes, businesses, ecosystems, and endangered
species. Ocean acidification is another harmful side effect of climate
change. Almost 30 percent of carbon dioxide emissions are absorbed by
our oceans, and as our oceans get warmer, their composition changes,
further affecting the ways aquatic plants and animals grow.
This all poses a massive threat to Maine's key industries. Farms,
forests, fisheries, working waterfronts, and tourism are all grappling
with the implications of changing temperatures. The future of Maine's
communities, economy, and the lives and health of our citizens depends
on policymakers' ability to confront the challenge of the climate
crisis.
But Maine is not standing idly by; we are tackling this challenge
head-on. Earlier this year, the Maine Legislature and Governor Mills
enacted a sweeping bipartisan climate change bill, which includes
slashing greenhouse gas emissions by 80 percent and increasing the
amount of electricity from renewable sources to 100 percent by 2050. In
addition, the legislation created a 35-member Maine Climate Council
charged with developing specific plans to meet these goals. Although
the Governor's goals seem lofty, they are in keeping with the spirit of
innovation on display by so many of our public and private sector
citizens. Our state motto, Dirigo, means ``I lead,'' and Mainers are
demonstrating that leadership in many fields.
For over 10 years, the University of Maine has led the country in
developing an economical way to harness renewable wind energy in deep
ocean waters. Last week, the Public Utilities Commission approved a
contract for Maine Aqua Ventus, a first-of-its-kind floating offshore
wind pilot project developed at the University. This project is poised
to be the first offshore wind project in the country that features a
floating platform. In addition to providing renewable energy, the
University has estimated the project will produce nearly $152 million
in total economic output and more than 1,000 Maine-based jobs.
Individual citizens are also taking action. After noting the
changes in his oyster stock due in part to increasing acidification in
the water ways where he farms, Bill Mook of Mook Sea Farm started
adapting his business. He created a filtration system to ensure
appropriate pH levels are maintained to protect the growing shellfish.
He is also growing his own oyster food through a unique heterotrophic
method to produce algae. This unique process differs from the
industry's standard phototrophic process and reduces time, labor, and
electrical costs.
Additionally, Maine's forestry sector provides a range of solutions
to climate change, from creating wood products to providing renewable
energy sources. Maine has the highest percentage of forest land in the
country, the vast majority of which is privately owned. Exciting new
technologies are being developed in Maine that convert forest residues
from harvesting and processing wood into renewable chemicals, biofuels,
and other bio-based materials. For example, the University of Maine's
Advanced Structures and Composites Center has developed a way to make
nano cellulose for use in bio-plastics and fully recyclable materials
using wood products and lumber.
The intersection of agriculture and climate change is especially of
interest to me, having been an organic farmer since the 1970s. Earlier
this year, I released a document with five principles to help guide
discussions around climate change and agriculture, and I am currently
working on legislation that I look forward to sharing with the Select
Committee. Those five principles are:
prioritize soil health initiatives;
protect farmland and improve farm viability;
support pasture-based livestock systems;
invest in on-farm and rural energy initiatives; and
reduce food waste.
I would like to thank the Select Committee for holding a hearing on
agriculture last month, including a farmer on the panel, and
facilitating a conversation that recognizes how vital farmers are to
climate change mitigation and adaptation. Agriculture is one of the few
industries that can actually reverse the effects of climate change by
storing carbon in the soil. We have not given farmers enough credit for
this fact, and I am excited about the efforts in the private sector to
figure out how we can better compensate farmers for the ecosystem
services they provide.
One innovative project in Maine that will help farmers sequester
more carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions is OpenTEAM, or Open
Technology Ecosystem for Agricultural Management. OpenTEAM is a public-
private partnership between Wolfe's Neck Center for Agriculture and the
Environment based in Freeport, Maine; Stonyfield Organic; and
Foundation for Food and Agriculture Research, which receives farm bill
funding. Right now farmers have a multitude of options when it comes to
decision-making software, but most of those platforms do not
communicate with one another so it is difficult to share information up
and down the supply chain. OpenTEAM is an interoperable platform to
help farmers make soil health decisions by offering a range of tools in
one place, from carbon measurement to remote sensing.
Confronting the climate crisis requires us all to work together to
develop, implement, and share the best solutions. States, communities,
and individuals have already begun this work, and I look forward to
continuing to work with the Select Committee as you develop policy
recommendations. I would like to again thank the Committee for your
important work on this topic.
Ms. Castor. Well, you are just getting started,
Congresswoman. Thank you very much for your leadership, and I
look forward to working with you.
Dr. Schrier, welcome. You are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. KIM SCHRIER, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS
FROM THE STATE OF WASHINGTON
Ms. Schrier. Thank you, Madam Chair. It has been an
absolute delight to hear so many of my colleagues talking about
this issue. It is very refreshing, so thank you for having this
special committee.
I wanted to talk about this issue because, if there was
ever an issue that would unite our country and should unite the
world, it is really combating climate change. And you have
heard from a lot of people here about how it is affecting their
States. Washington State is not very different. We are in the
West. We have wildfires that are growing in intensity, scope,
and duration. We have warming tributaries, warming rivers that
are affecting our Chinook salmon population and others. Kids
are getting asthma because of these wildfires, and you heard
from Derek Kilmer about displaced Native American populations.
But it turns out that wherever you are in the country,
frankly, wherever you are in the world, there is one population
that suffers more than any other, and that is kids. Whether it
is from natural disasters and seeing their house disappear,
whether that is from asthma attacks, whether that is from
changes in nutrients or even from vector-borne diseases or
cholera, kids are suffering the most and stand the most to
lose.
There are a couple ways that I am looking to address this.
One is that we just had a study out yesterday that confirmed
that children are the most affected, but we also recently had a
study about nutrients in plants and in agriculture. And it
turns out that with more CO2, you would think that
plants would grow better, and it turns out that they do grow
well, but they increase, you know, in carbohydrate, and at the
same time, there is decreased protein, B vitamins, iron, zinc,
and foliate. And here in this country, we can take a
multivitamin, but there is a lot of places around this country
where potatoes, wheat, and rice really make up the main part of
people's diets and children's diets, and a zinc or iron-
deficient child has less potential for learning, for growth,
and for everything else. Not to mention that pregnant women who
don't get enough foliate, and there is about a 30 percent
decrease in foliate, have a much higher risk of having children
with neural tube defects.
And so this issue of food and nutrients becomes a pressing
one for our global community, and so I am close to introducing
a bill to make sure that we can have more research into the
effects of climate change on nutrients and also incentivizes
researchers to look into how we can remedy the problem and find
a solution.
There is another area where I can see a need for
improvement here, which is to take on this issue of vector-
borne diseases. Think about Dengue fever, think about Zika
virus and what would happen if that made a great entrance into
the United States and what affect that would have on
generations. And so having NIH funding for research into
vaccinations for vector-borne diseases would be critical.
The last thing I wanted to talk about is that I wanted to
thank you, first, for having paper cups and pitchers of water,
because I find on a daily basis that I am aggravated by the
amount of plastic that is used here in the Capitol. So Haley
Stevens and I have created a plastics caucus, and I have
already drafted a letter to Representative Zoe Lofgren,
chairman on the House Committee on Administration, with the
goal of having a more sustainable Capitol, that we should be
leading on this, and how hypocritical, frankly, is it for
Democrats to be leading and to still have plastic water bottles
at all of our meeting rooms and breakfasts. And so this letter
concerns making sure that anything that is sold to or offered
for sale in the Capitol should be sustainable. This means
getting rid of the plastic silverware that we use, and the next
step is making a huge dent in single-use plastics.
I think that is all I have to add today. I wanted to thank
you very much for hosting this, and I am excited to partner
with you and my colleagues on all of these issues. Thank you.

Testimony of the Hon. Kimberly ``Kim'' Schrier
A Representative in Congress from the State of Washington
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
I want to express my appreciation for the work Chairwoman Castor
and her staff are putting forth on the critical issue of climate
change. In my mind, there is no greater threat facing our world today
and our actions, and our inaction or inaction, will have consequences
for generations to come.
As a pediatrician, I have seen firsthand the impact climate change
is having on our children. Increased rates of asthma, longer allergy
season, and increased risk of disease. Pregnant women and children are
especially vulnerable to these changes.
According to the Lancet Countdown's 2019 report, which was released
yesterday, global air pollution driven by fossil fuels, and compounded
by climate change, led to seven million premature deaths. Already in
2016, there were 2.9 million premature pre-mature deaths related to
increasing pollution.
A warming climate is resulting in lower crop yields and affecting
the overall nutritional density of our foods. Research has shown that
carbon dioxide (CO2) levels this century will alter the
protein, micronutrients, and vitamin content of staple crops around the
world. One of the few studies which looked at this issue involved
researchers from the University of Washington, the USDA and
international partners. They looked at 18 rice lines and grew them
under conditions that you would expect later in the century. Among the
findings included a 30 percent decline in folate. Folate is critical
for healthy child development. Pregnant women who don't get enough
folate are at much higher risk of having babies with birth defects.
I am working on a bill now to ensure our researchers have dedicated
funding to study this issue further and proactively address it.
I also want to note that as temperatures rise, there is more of a
chance for disease to spread. Nine of the 10 most favorable years for
the spread of dengue fever have happened since 2000, and vector borne
disease is on the rise. These things can be mitigated.
Thank you again for the opportunity to speak on such an important
issue and I yield the remaining amount of my time.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you very much for your testimony.
You know, as a pediatrician, you bring such a unique
perspective to the issues of the climate crisis, and we are
going to need your help going forward. So thank you very much.
Next I am going to turn to my colleague from the Energy and
Commerce Committee.
Mr. Kennedy, you are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. JOSEPH P. KENNEDY III, A REPRESENTATIVE
IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS
Mr. Kennedy. Madam Chair, thank you. Thank you for your
extraordinary leadership on this issue and so many others.
Thank you for convening this opportunity for Members to
contribute their input and for bringing us all together today.
If we are going to confront a multigenerational crisis like
climate change, we must pay close attention to our prior
failures--not just failed environmental policies and the
illogical idea that reducing environmental regulation would
somehow encourage fossil-fuel companies to protect our air,
water, and land on their own, but the reforms that Congress and
administrations have championed for decades that too often left
far too many clinging to the margins of our Nation.
A New Deal that excluded agricultural workers and domestic
workers from its benefits and protections. A National Housing
Act that institutionalized redlining and housing discrimination
so effectively that it has resulted in a staggering racial
wealth gap that still persists today. A GI Bill that denied 1.2
million black veterans the same benefits that lifted up
millions of white veterans who fought shoulder-to-shoulder on
the same battlefields. A war on drugs where the enemy was far
too often young black men rather than the drugs devastating our
communities. A welfare reform bill that implemented work
requirements on striving Americans and denied them access to
critical antipoverty programs that would have otherwise lifted
them out of poverty.
War, poverty, employment, housing, justice--all of it
shaded by our inability or unwillingness to see entire segments
of our society at the moment when they needed the help the
most.
Now, as climate change threatens our way of life, we are
dangerously close to repeating those same mistakes of our past.
Wildfires burn thousands of homes in California, and we see how
effective fire prevention efforts save wealthy areas while
displaced families go homeless because affordable housing is
nowhere to be found.
A hurricane that causes increased devastation because of
nonexistent zoning laws in Texas garners immediate government
attention, but one that leaves Puerto Ricans hungry, homeless,
and helpless receives government derision. Wealthy beachfront
homeowners leverage flood insurance to boost property values on
second or third homes, while working Americans have seen their
home value crater as sea level rises.
Nearly 80 percent--80 percent--of African Americans live
within 30 miles of a coal plant, breathing in toxic chemicals
and living with the health consequences of generations of
deference to fossil fuels. More than 80 percent of Latinos live
in American counties where at least one Federal air pollution
law has been violated.
In cities across our country, low-income communities suffer
from extreme-heat zones and lack of tree canopy and air
conditioning, raising the risks of asthma and heart disease for
people already living in areas with limited access to quality,
affordable healthcare.
The climate crisis is intersectional, it is
intergenerational, and it demands that we acknowledge and
address the failures of our past, which is why we must seek
more than old ideas of incremental change and, instead, demand
a climate justice that looks deeper than the purity of our air
and water; why any carbon tax must be more than a regressive
tax passed along to rate payers at a higher cost but, instead,
an investment in the low-income communities that have been left
on the front lines of the economic and healthcare costs of
inaction.
But any plan for green jobs and green energy cannot be
allowed to lead to green gentrification that pushes out
residents who have been forced to breathe dirty air and drink
harmful water and, instead, lifts those working Americans up
with careers in emerging green-economy sectors through policies
like the Blue Collar to Green Collar Jobs Development Act.
Any tax credits that incent clean-energy expansion, like
offshore wind, should be targeted towards corporations that
build these emerging sectors in low-income communities, train
American workers, and create American jobs.
Any structural reforms in how regulators approve energy
development should be transparent and accountable to the
consumers who will be left with the bill.
Now, as we make this transition to a new energy future, any
existing or proposed energy infrastructure projects must not be
approved solely on its individual merit but on how it fits into
a broader energy and climate landscape.
Climate change on its own does not discriminate. It targets
us all. But just as human activity undeniably causes climate
change, human choices have put communities of color and low-
income Americans in its cross-hairs.
Now we are presented with an opportunity to right the
wrongs of our past and do right by generations that will follow
in our footsteps. Working with this select committee, I know we
can bring those communities who have been on the front lines to
the forefront of this debate and the policies that will emerge
from it.
Thank you. Thank you for your leadership.

Mr. Rouda, you are recognized for 5 minutes. Welcome.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. HARLEY ROUDA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA
Mr. Rouda. Thank you, Madam Chair. I will be submitting
written testimony, but I wanted to say a few words.
Where we have built our farms, our cities, and our homes
are all based on predictable weather patterns over the last
thousand years. When we raise the ambient temperature of our
atmosphere by even a few degrees, where we have built,
literally, our homes, our cities, and our farms are in the
wrong place because of these shifting weather patterns.
That is why there are estimates right now of over 200
million climate change refugees by the year 2050. This is the
largest mass migration of humankind since World War II. There
will be competition for water, food, and safe areas around the
world.
And when you look at the fact that 40 percent of the
world's population sits in coastal communities and 50 percent
of the United States population sits in coastal communities,
you get a sense for how extreme climate change will impact our
coastal communities and inland areas as well.
The Department of Defense has recognized that climate
change is a primary threat to our national defense. It has also
been estimated that over $300 billion will be needed to upgrade
defense installations around the world, with a significant
number of them being in coastal areas.
In California, where I am from, Orange County, it has been
shown that in the last 100 years we have seen our oceans rise
by only 9 inches in the State of California, but the
projections are, through the end of this century, that we are
looking at a 9-foot rise in sea levels.
So my bill, the Coastal Communities Adaptation Act, H.R.
1317, provides the assets and resources for coastal communities
to be able to address climate-change impact on their ability to
maintain some level of support in addressing how it is going to
impact their communities and make a difference in the lives of
those in those communities.
And, again, emphasizing the fact that 50 percent of
Americans live in coastal communities, you can see how
important this legislation would be for their ability to
maintain their neighborhoods.
I appreciate the opportunity to testify here today and
yield back. Thank you.

Member Day
November 14, 2019
I would like to thank Chairwoman Castor and Ranking Member Graves
for providing this opportunity to come and testify today to recommend
an important piece of legislation aimed at ensuring that our
communities are resilient to the impacts of climate change.
As you and the members of this committee already know, climate
change is not only real--it is already happening and Americans
throughout the country are experiencing serious effects.
That's why, earlier this year, I introduced H.R. 1317, The Coastal
Communities Adaptation Act. This piece of legislation is important to
the district I represent and coastal districts across the country and
has earned the support of 33 cosponsors.
For far too many coastal districts like the one I represent,
climate change has already increased the frequency of coastal flooding,
including what we would consider ``regular'' tidal floods. The
combination of water expansion as the ocean has warmed and the melting
of land ice into the oceans has driven sea level up about seven inches
since 1990, and this rise is accelerating.
Just this summer, the Los Angeles Times reported that, ``In the
last 100 years, the sea rose less than 9 inches in California. By the
end of this century, the surge could be greater than 9 feet.''
My bill would jumpstart research and grant funding by the National
Science Foundation (NSF) and the National Institute for Standards and
Technology (NIST) into improved buildings and structures to account for
extreme weather, create a prize competition to stimulate innovation for
new techniques into natural shoreline risk reduction measures, direct
the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) to promote the
adoption of windstorm preparedness and mitigation measures for HUD-code
housing units, and order new research by National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) into the use and effectiveness of
nature-based and nonstructural approaches to reduce flood risk.
Higher sea levels mean that deadly and destructive storm surges
push farther inland and bring more frequent flooding to coastal
communities. With sea levels expected to continue to rise, many
vulnerable coastal populations will be further impacted. What was once
a niche planning effort to limit seasonal storm damage is now a broad
effort to integrate hazard planning and water management into all
aspects of local comprehensive plans and related development codes.
We must consider high and extreme sea levels when making decisions
that directly impact people and critical resources in coastal
California and in the other 29 coastal states (including Great Lake
states) across the country.
Coastal communities recognize the necessity of integrating climate
change considerations into their planning--resiliency planning is a
fundamental part of how communities plan, grow, and prosper. This is
not a one-size-fits-all solution to a diverse and multi-faceted
challenge. The financing tools provided by my bill will help
communities large and small turn their unique resiliency plans into a
safer reality.
The shorelines of Louisiana, Virginia, and Texas are shrinking.
Beaches in North and South Carolina are disappearing. Places like
Florida, Hawaii, and Guam are already drowning. And, California's coast
is eroding more and more with each storm surge.
Our coastal lands are treasured natural resources, and they are
also something else--they are places that many Americans call home.
This is about more than sandy beaches, surf breaks, and boardwalks--
this is about our lives, our businesses, and critical infrastructure.
Thank you again for the opportunity to testify today, and I urge
the Select Committee to consider supporting this legislation because we
need to address the reality of climate change if we want to maintain
the same quality of life--our planet's oceans will not wait until we're
ready--sea levels will continue to rise, whether we are prepared or
not.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you very much. As a Member who
represents a coastal community, I will look forward to
reviewing your legislation. Thank you for being here.
Mr. Rouda. Thank you.
Ms. Castor. Speaking of a coastal community, you can't get
much more coastal than the Florida Keys and South Miami-Dade.
Thank you, Congresswoman Mucarsel-Powell, for touring me around
to see the climate impacts in your district.
You are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. DEBBIE MUCARSEL-POWELL, A REPRESENTATIVE
IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA
Ms. Mucarsel-Powell. Thank you, Madam Chair.
And thank so much for taking the time to come down to south
Florida and my beautiful district. And as we discussed last
week and you saw firsthand, we really are ground zero for the
effects of climate change.
The storms are getting much stronger. We see continued sea-
level rise, which is already affecting our infrastructure. And,
more urgently, what we are seeing recently is that our coral
reefs are dying; the rainforests of our oceans are dying. So it
is definitely a very urgent situation for my district, along
with so many other coastal communities.
I wanted to bring attention to this picture. Parts of Key
Largo and many areas of south Florida have experienced more
than 40 days of flooding due to king tides just this fall
alone, fall of 2019. And king tides, as they are called, they
are normal to a certain point, because they are the result of
the gravitational pull of the sun and the moon as well as the
low pressure systems and strong winds. But, this year, the
flooding has been higher and longer than we can ever remember.
And with sea-level rise and changing weather patterns, it will
only get worse. And so this is definitely something that we
have seen just this year alone.
Climate change is not only an environmental issue; it is
something that we have to deal with in the far off--not
something that we are going to have to deal with in the far-off
future. It is already changing our way of life. It is putting
our property in the path of destruction. It is already
affecting our fishing industry, our tourism industry, and our
economy as a whole.
And while some want to put their heads under the sand on
this issue, I think that we are stepping up to the challenge in
south Florida, and I am very, very proud of my community and
the steps that we are taking. I don't want to only be an
alarmist. I want to bring solutions to the table that we can
actually address and take action on immediately.
So Florida International University, in my district, is
filled with forward-thinking, creative, and innovative minds
that are working every single day, all day long, trying to come
up with ways not only to fight climate change but also to adapt
to the consequences that climate change will inevitably bring.
Researchers there are working to advance green
infrastructure initiatives, which you were able to see
firsthand, like protecting our coral reefs and seagrass beds,
which dissipate wave action; restoring coastal wetlands, which
clean our fresh water; and restoring our mangroves, which
absorb vast amounts of CO2. They protect against
storm surges and also weaken strong winds.
I know that here in Congress, with the will and commitment,
we can support these innovative efforts.
So some of the work that our researchers have done, which I
am really proud to show you here--and I will leave you one so
that you can take a look--is, at the FIU's Institute of
Environment, they have printed these 3D mangroves that are made
out of Eco-Cement, and they can actually be planted along our
coasts. And they will restore the natural growth of other
mangroves, so it will act as a foundation for creating new
habitat.
And all we need is the commitment to support innovation
like what we are seeing right in my district, in Florida's 26th
District, at FIU and invest in these ideas. We can do it here
in the United States, but we just can't wait any longer.
So I really am grateful for your support, for coming down,
and to allow us to testify today before your committee.

Testimony of the Hon. Debbie Mucarsel-Powell
A Representative in Congress from the State of Florida
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you, Chairwoman Castor. And thank you again so much for
taking the time last week to visit my beautiful district in South
Florida. As we discussed and saw first-hand, South Florida--and more
specifically--the Florida Keys, is ground zero for climate change.
We are seeing dramatic sea level rise. We are seeing stronger
storms. And our coral reefs--the rainforests of the ocean--are dying.
I'd like to bring your attention to this picture. Parts of Key
Largo and many areas of South Florida experienced more than 40 days of
flooding. King tides, as these are called, are normal to a certain
point, because they are the result of the gravitational pull of the sun
and the moon, as well as low pressure systems and strong winds. But
this year, the flooding is higher and longer than we can remember. And
with sea level rise and changing weather patterns, it will only get
worse.
Climate change is not just an environmental issue, and it's not
something that we have to deal with in the far-off future. It is
already changing our way of life. It is already putting our property in
the path of destruction. It is already affecting our fishing industry,
our tourism industry, and our economy as a whole.
While some have chosen to put their heads in the sand on this
issue, South Florida is stepping up to the challenge.
Florida International University in my district is filled with
forward-thinking, creative, and innovative minds that are working day
in and day out, coming up with ways to not only fight climate change,
but also adapt to the consequences that climate change will inevitably
bring. Researchers there are working to advance green infrastructure
initiatives, like protecting coral reefs and sea grass beds, which
dissipate wave action, restoring coastal wetlands, which clean our
fresh water, and restoring our mangroves, which absorb vast amounts of
CO2, protect against storm surges, and weaken strong winds.
In Congress, we must support innovative efforts, like researchers'
work at FIU's Institute of Environment to 3-D print mangroves using
eco-cement. These can then be planted along our coasts to help restore
natural mangrove stands and act as a foundation for new habitats.
Innovation like this is the answer. The Committee must take full
advantage of the talent we have in our own backyard.
Ms. Castor. Well, thank you again.
You know, the trip to Florida International University, one
of the things that stuck with me is when the scientists there
advised that they thought that hurricanes now are becoming so
intense that we need to go a Category 6.
And the juxtaposition of that idea and that thinking with,
now, the everyday flooding on Key Largo has--I mean, you can't
help but, after that visit, come back here and say, we have to
take climate action now. We don't have time to waste. So thank
you for showing me firsthand the impact in your district.
You know, in so many ways, it is a slow-moving
catastrophe--and we heard that from the scientists there--but
not in your district. Boy, the everyday impacts of extreme
temperatures, the rising seas, the flooding, the impact on
coral reefs, it just--it is a call to action.
Ms. Mucarsel-Powell. Yes. And, you know, a lot of the parts
in south Florida have been built on top of this coral rock, so
water seeps very easily through the pavement. So we are seeing
flooding events that we haven't really seen in the past two,
three decades.
It is really urgent, which is why I think that we really
don't have time to waste, especially when we have ideas and we
have some great innovation that we can put into effect right
away just by supporting it. And I think in Congress that is
something that we need to do right away.
Ms. Castor. Thank you very much.
Ms. Mucarsel-Powell. Thank you.
Ms. Castor. Mr. Malinowski, are you going close us out
here? Welcome. I am interested in hearing your ideas and
recommendations. You are recognized for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF THE HON. TOM MALINOWSKI, A REPRESENTATIVE IN
CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
Mr. Malinowski. Thank you so much. Thanks for saving the
best for last. So thank you so much for having me, and I do
appreciate the chance to testify on behalf of the Seventh
District in New Jersey.
And I want to talk about the climate crisis, of course. And
I know that I don't need to tell you or anybody on this
committee that the case for action to prevent climate change is
strong. Every catastrophic storm, whether it hits Florida or
New Jersey or any other part of this country, makes the case
for us.
Outside the political realm, I don't think anybody really
disputes it. And yet here in Congress, every time we consider
doing something, we are confronted with the old, reflexive
argument that we can't afford it.
Senator Marco Rubio, somebody who I have known for years,
actually, and have worked with on many, many issues, recently
wrote an op-ed, which I am sure you saw, saying that, yes,
climate change is real, but instead of trying to stave it off,
we should brace for impact, resigning ourselves to, quote,
``adaptation.''
Every plan that has been put forward to actually do
something to prevent disaster, he said, would, quote,
``constrain our economy and neutralize our tenuous economic
advantage over China.''
Well, I don't just question the morality of that argument;
I question its connection to economic reality. China today is
investing three times as much in clean energy as the United
States. Twenty percent of the energy it consumes comes from
renewable sources, compared to just 11 percent in the United
States. Why is China doing this? It is not because the
Communist Party loves trees. It is because they want to win the
future. And I am here because I want America to win the future.
In New Jersey, the companies I meet with are eager to lead
the way. Their customers demand it. The employees they are
trying to recruit expect it. What they ask from government is
that we set a goal, backed by tax and regulatory policies that
give them an incentive to meet that goal, and that once we
commit, we stay committed so that they have the confidence to
make the necessary up-front investments.
It is what New Jersey has done. We are committed to get to
50 percent clean power generation by 2030 and 100 percent by
2050. We should do the same here.
We have 52,000 jobs in New Jersey in renewable energy, such
as wind and solar, clean vehicles manufacturing, energy
efficiency, led by many companies in my district, like Green
Power Energy in Annandale, New Jersey. That is as many jobs as
Walmart, UPS, and Verizon combined in the State of New Jersey.
And we know we can have far more if Washington just follows
where States and the private sector are leading.
That is why I am a cosponsor of H.R. 763, the bipartisan
Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which, as you know,
would put a fee on the production of fossil fuels and return
the money raised through equal shares to the American people to
spend as they see fit.
I recently met with around a dozen large and small
companies in New Jersey under the auspices of the Chamber of
Commerce, and I asked them, do you support putting a market
price on carbon? Every single hand shot up.
But whatever market-based mechanism we adopt, America's
leading Fortune 500 companies agree with climate activists,
with scientists, that it is past time for Congress to catch up
and start acting. Companies from Bank of America to DuPont, to
Procter & Gamble, to Johnson & Johnson, The Walt Disney
Company, have all urged us to stay in the Paris Climate
Agreement and to take the sorts of actions that will
incentivize them to do what they want to do.
There are not a lot of socialists on the boards of those
companies, Madam Chair, just Americans who want our innovators
and our entrepreneurs to lead the global movement to a clean-
energy future. Let's stand with them before it is too late.
Thank you.

A Representative in Congress from the State of New Jersey
Before the U.S. House of Representatives, Select Committee on the
Climate Crisis
Member Day
November 14, 2019
Thank you Chairman and Ranking Member. I appreciate the chance to
testify today on behalf of New Jersey's 7th Congressional District.
I know I don't need to tell you the case for action to prevent
climate change. Each catastrophic storm makes the argument for us, on
top of all the other signs that something is happening to the planet
that will affect the lives of generations to come. Outside the
political realm, virtually no one disputes this.

Ms. Castor. Thank you, Mr. Malinowski.
Your expertise in foreign affairs will prove invaluable to
this committee. We need your thoughtful, reasoned
recommendations as we develop our policy recommendations. And I
would like to continue the dialogue with you after this on what
we need to be doing through Foreign Affairs to give our
businesses, give our families, give our scientists every
opportunity to compete on a level playing field across the
globe.
Mr. Malinowski. Thank you. If we don't do it, someone else
will.
Ms. Castor. Thank you.
All right. So I really appreciate the professional staff,
all the input of the Members today. We are going to wrap a lot
of the recommendations we heard here into our policy
recommendations going forward. So thank you all very much.
The committee is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 4:31 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]
