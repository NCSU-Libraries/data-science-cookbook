MARKUP OF: VIEWS AND ESTIMATES OF THE SMALL BUSINESS COMMITTEE FOR FY
2020
----------
WEDNESDAY, MARCH 6, 2019
House of Representatives,
Committee on Small Business,
Washington, DC.
The committee met, pursuant to call, at 10:50 a.m., in Room
2360, Rayburn House Office Building. Hon. Nydia Velazquez
[chairwoman of the committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Velazquez, Finkenauer, Kim,

Radewagen, Kelly, Balderson, Hern, Hagedorn, Stauber, Burchett,
and Joyce.
Chairwoman VELAZQUEZ. Good morning. The Small Business
Committee will come to order.
Today's order of business is to consider the Views and
Estimates of the Committee on Small Business for fiscal year
2020. These resources are a critical first step in helping
entrepreneurs start and grow their business and in aiding
established businesses to leverage their experience to invest
in their business and employees.
I will admit that we are again considering our views and
estimates before there is a proposed budget provided from the
Administration. Unfortunately, this is becoming all too common.
Nevertheless, we are here to set our priorities and
expectations for fiscal year 2020 to ensure the Small Business
Administration has the necessary resources and funding to
modernize and strengthen its core programs on behalf of
America's entrepreneurs.
While the economy is healthy, much uncertainty remains. As
a recent GDP report from the Commerce Department suggests, the
economy is slowing. In fact, there is consensus among many
economists that the forecast for this year is growing dim.
Rising interest rates, increasing tariffs, market volatility,
and a depressed global economy have led consumer confidence to
fall.
With fears of a recession growing, and a Harvard economist
and former Treasury secretary estimating a 50 percent chance by
2020, more entrepreneurs and small business owners are looking
towards the Small Business Administration and its many programs
for help.
That is why it is imperative that such critical programs
are properly funded and at robust levels. The SBA's core
programs ensure small employers and budding entrepreneurs have
the financing, training, counseling, and access to the Federal
marketplace they deserve as they work to strengthen our
economy.
Today's Views and Estimates reiterates the Committee's
longstanding position to prioritize core programs, like the
Small Business Development Centers and Women's Business
Centers, rather than expanding critical funding on untested,
agency-initiated programs.
In order to support the SBA in its mission and to leverage
the success of current programs, such as the SBA's flagship
7(a) lending program, the agency requires our commitment to
provide the requisite resources and funding levels.
Today's proposal carries forward this commitment, but at
the same time recognizes where improvements and increased
oversight are needed. It is a priority for this Committee to
take a renewed look at the entrepreneurial development programs
to maximize their effectiveness by modernizing the programs.
In doing so, we can deliver better results for the millions
of entrepreneurs utilizing the SBA's resources and that of its
resource partners.
Finally, we all must work together to level the playing
field in lending and Federal procurement opportunities for
socially and economically disadvantaged business owners all
over the country. We can achieve this through a greater
emphasis on hiring more contracting personnel and providing
them with adequate training in order to effectively assist
small contractors competing in the $500 billion Federal
marketplace.
The budget we are proposing will breathe new life into the
SBA. More importantly, it will provide tangible benefits to
small businesses and make sure taxpayers get a positive return
on their investment.
At this point, I will yield to the Ranking Member, Mr.
Chabot, for any comments he may have on the Committee's Views
and Estimates.
Mr. CHABOT. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. And good morning
to everyone who is here. I want to thank the Chair and her
staff for working in a bipartisan manner on the Budget Views
and Estimates. I appreciate her willingness to work collegially
as we meet our responsibilities to small businesses all across
the country.
According to the latest economic numbers, the U.S. economy
is continuing to improve and economic forecasts are strong. In
our congressional districts back home and in hearings in
Cincinnati and here in Washington and all over the country we
hear from small business owners that they are optimistic about
the future. There are fewer regulations from Washington, and
they have more money to invest in their business because of the
Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.
However, small businesses are still finding it difficult
for access to capital. The Small Business Administration (SBA)
and its programs are key to helping small firms expand, create
jobs, and grow our economy. These programs help small
businesses to access capital, provide counseling and training,
and link entrepreneurs with mentors.
The SBA, in short, is vital to their success in many
instances. Our job is to ensure that the SBA's programs are
working efficiently and effectively. We must insist that they
are transparent and making the best use of taxpayer dollars.
I often say that every small business starts as an idea.
America is a Nation of creators, inventors, and risk-takers.
Our economy was structured to be driven by entrepreneurs, and
in fact, most net job growth is from startups and new
businesses. Under Administrator Linda McMahon's leadership, the
SBA has made progress in delivering its services and ensuring
that it is offering the services that small businesses need.
She has traveled across the country visiting all 68 SBA
district offices, and she listens to the SBA employees and she
listens to small businesses.
Again, I want to thank the Chairwoman, and I yield back the
balance of my time.
Chairwoman VELAZQUEZ. The gentleman yields back, and I
thank him for his remarks.
Are there any other members who wish to be recognized for a
statement on the Views and Estimates on the priorities of the
Committee for fiscal year 2020?
Seeing no members, the Committee now moves to consideration
of the Views and Estimates. The clerk will read the title of
the document.
The CLERK. Views and Estimates of the Committee on Small
Business on matters to be set forth----
Chairwoman VELAZQUEZ. I ask unanimous consent that the
Views and Estimates be considered as read and open for
amendment in its entirety.
Does any member seek recognition for the purpose of
offering an amendment?
Seeing no amendments we will move on.
And the question is on adopting the Views and Estimates on
the priorities of the Committee for fiscal year 2020.
All those in favor say aye.
Those opposed no.
In the opinion of the Chair the ayes have it.
The ayes have it, and the Views and Estimates are agreed
to.
I will now recognize the Ranking Member for the purpose of
making a motion.
Mr. CHABOT. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.
I would move that the minority members of the Committee be
permitted to offer additional views and estimates on the budget
for fiscal year 2020.
Chairwoman VELAZQUEZ. Thank you.
Without objection, so ordered.
And the Committee is authorized to make technical and
grammatical corrections to the Views and Estimates. And I
believe that concludes the business before the Committee today.
So if there is no further business to come before the
Committee, we are adjourned and the Committee will stand in
recess for a few moments to prepare for the Committee hearing.
Thank you.
[Whereupon, at 10:57 a.m., the committee was adjourned.]
