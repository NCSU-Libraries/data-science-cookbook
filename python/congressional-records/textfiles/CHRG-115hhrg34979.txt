SECURITY CLEARANCE PROCESSING STATUS REPORT

House of Representatives,
Committee on Armed Services,
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations,

The subcommittee met, pursuant to call, at 3:30 p.m., in
room 2118, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Matt Gaetz
presiding.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MATT GAETZ, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
FLORIDA, SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND INVESTIGATIONS
Mr. Gaetz. Good afternoon. This hearing will come to order.
I am chairing today's hearing because, sadly, Chairwoman Vicky
Hartzler's father has just passed away. Certainly all of us
here are mindful of the sad time for Chairwoman Hartzler and
her family, and our thoughts and prayers are with them.
Chairwoman Hartzler was eager that this hearing take place,
notwithstanding these sad circumstances, and this is because
the Armed Services Committee is deeply interested in the
security clearance process. It is essential that a rigorous,
fair, and expedient process exist to identify individuals who
should be allowed to access classified government data.
Without a sound security system, our Nation's safety is
potentially endangered and military readiness harmed. It is the
Oversight Subcommittee's fifth event on this topic. Today, we
will receive another mandated quarterly briefing on the
security clearance process. Among other topics, we will hear
about the size of the clearance background--or backlog, I
should say, the trends of the backlog, and the management
initiatives to address it.
I am also interested in learning about the status of the
Department of Defense's assumption of responsibility for
background investigations and the transition of the management
of that process from the National Background Investigations
Bureau.
I now turn to my colleague, Ranking Member Seth Moulton,
for his opening remarks.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Gaetz can be found in the
Appendix on page 17.]
STATEMENT OF HON. SETH MOULTON, A REPRESENTATIVE FROM
MASSACHUSETTS, RANKING MEMBER, SUBCOMMITTEE ON OVERSIGHT AND
INVESTIGATIONS
Mr. Moulton. I thank you, Chairman Gaetz. And I also want
to express my sympathies to Vicky Hartzler and her family.
Today marks our subcommittee's fifth discussion on reforms
to the Department of Defense's background investigation and
security clearance process. Over the last 6 months, the
National Background Investigations Bureau has made some notable
improvements by significantly lowering the investigation
backlog. However, every day the backlog exists, we are delaying
the hiring of qualified national security personnel, which
threatens to disrupt U.S. economic growth and military
readiness.
In June, the administration formally announced its plan to
transfer responsibility of background investigations for all
Federal agencies to the Department of Defense. Today, I am
looking forward to hearing an update from our witnesses on the
personnel conversion process for OPM [Office of Personnel
Management] employees and any additional costs incurred or
authorities required to keep this transition on track.
While I agree that we need to streamline the background
investigation process, I am skeptical of DOD's [Department of
Defense's] current ability to absorb such a cumbersome task.
Furthermore, I remain concerned about the current strategy as
we must ensure that we are not expediting the investigation
portion of the security clearance process while unintentionally
backlogging the adjudication portion of the process.
I look forward to hearing what efforts the Department is
undertaking to ensure clearances will not be delayed in another
part of an already laborious system. We must also be careful
not to sacrifice thoroughness and accuracy for the sole purpose
of achieving efficiency. I am aware that DOD is using
continuous evaluation and automated processes to reduce the
investigative timeline for periodic reinvestigations, and it
appears to be having a positive effect. While there are
benefits to using technology to expedite the review of security
clearance investigations, there are limits to the role that
technology can play. Portions of the investigative process,
such as reference interviews, cannot be replaced.
While some progress has been made, I am eager to hear more
today about further steps the Department has taken towards
resolving these issues. Thank you, and I look forward to your
testimony, and with that I yield back.
Mr. Gaetz. Thank you, Ranking Member Moulton.
Our briefers today are Mr. Garry Reid, Director of Defense
Intelligence in the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense
for Intelligence; Mr. Dan Payne, Director of the Defense
Security Service; and Mr. Charles Phalen, the Director of the
National Background Investigations Bureau.
Thank you all for being here.
Mr. Reid, will you please begin.
STATEMENT OF GARRY P. REID, DIRECTOR FOR DEFENSE INTELLIGENCE,
OFFICE OF THE UNDER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE FOR INTELLIGENCE
Mr. Reid. Thank you, Congressman Gaetz and Ranking Member
Moulton, other members here today, and staff. Thank you for
having us over today to update you on where we are with our
ongoing work to reform the Federal vetting enterprise, and we
will talk about everything you just mentioned in terms of
security clearance processing, changes in the system, and
progress made today.
Since we were here last, we have continued to collaborate
closely from within DOD, the Defense Security Service, and the
National Background Investigations Bureau on the planning to
prepare for what you just mentioned, Ranking Member Moulton,
this upcoming transfer.
I would like to hit on a few key points that have occurred
since we were here last. As I already mentioned, in June, the
administration announced that the investigative activities
currently performed by NBIB [National Background Investigations
Bureau] would be consolidated with similar activities mandated
to the Department of Defense. This was in light of the previous
year's National Defense Authorization Act, which directed us to
transfer the DOD portion of that mission to the Department.
Subsequent to that, within the executive branch there was a
review and analysis of government efficiencies more broadly and
it was assessed that to maintain the greatest degree of
efficiency, the full mission would be transferred to DOD. We
were very supportive of this decision, frankly. We were working
through the process of splitting out of an enterprise, and
there was risk associated with that, and this is actually much
more streamlined for us from an efficiency standpoint and it
has served to increase our collaboration across the board.
We continue to do that planning. We are not executing that
just yet, but we soon will be once the final guidance is
promulgated and issued by the President. So we are continuing
to plan for that.
But we are not staying idle. As you mentioned, Congressman,
these interim measures that were announced in June included
additional options that would streamline the process, cut out
some of the man-hours, and speed things through the
investigative cycle. They included the ability to apply
continuous evaluation and automated records check as a way of
offsetting some of that and, frankly, as a way of not adding
new work to NBIB's existing work strain.
We in the Department of Defense implemented that guidance
on the last day of July, so about 4 months ago. We have been
working very closely with NBIB and our Performance
Accountability Council partners to implement these and help
reduce the inventory. We are pleased to say that over that
period of time, we are near a 20 percent reduction in the
overall for the DOD side of the inventory. You know, we are 80
percent of the total anyways, so across the board we are
realizing those benefits in the 18 to 22 percent range that
were envisioned when these measures were put in place. So in
the aggregate, we are down significantly from where we were at
the beginning of this year and where we were in the summer.
What is promising to us in the Department about this
development is the process that we are now implementing very
much mirrors the process we advocated for and the plan we
submitted to Congress in 2017 under section 951, which was a
shift towards more use of continuous evaluation automated
records checking. So we are doing that now. We are realizing
the benefits. We have a substantial cost avoidance factor that
we have already realized by processing up to--I think we are
about 20,000 now over the past few months. So this is the
system that we wanted to implement later. We are actually able
to implement it now.
The plan we submitted in 2017, we were directed
subsequently by Congress to implement by October of 2020. We
actually implemented the guts of that plan in July of this
year. And it really--as a function of the inventory and the
pressure to get that down, it actually helped us speed up
something that we were working through and intended to do
already. So we think that is a good development. It sets us on
the path to what will follow, which is transfer and transition
of this process for all the reasons you have already described.
We are working very closely with the committee, with our
industry partners, with academia, think tanks, and others
across the intellectual and commercial and government space to
identify best practices and help guide us through this
transition that comes ahead. We have solicited support of
mergers and integration experts to help plan this transfer. It
is a very large enterprise going from one branch of the
government to another, and there are a host of executive orders
and laws that apply to these agencies, and we are going through
that deliberate planning right now in anticipation of making
the transfer.
Throughout that time, we will continue to focus on the
daily mission of getting down the inventory for the reasons you
have already mentioned, and working with NBIB to help
streamline that process as much as possible.
Congressman, you mentioned, and we have heard it often,
that there is some skepticism that we are able to do this. I
can only tell you that we have the support from the highest
levels within our Department, from the Secretary and the Deputy
Secretary, and my boss, the Under Secretary, the Chief
Management Officer, and many other principals within the
Pentagon, our focus on this issue. We have strong support from
OMB [Office of Management and Budget], from Ms. Weichert, who
is also the acting OPM director, to help this through, from our
executive agent offices at the DNI and at OPM. We are all
pulling on this rope together. We are all cognizant of the
significant challenges ahead, and we are equally cognizant of
the necessity to do this mission on a daily basis. And we go
into this clear-eyed, but understanding that it is a
significant undertaking. It will not happen overnight. This
will evolve over a period of months. We will keep the mission
going. We will make the improvements, and we will do the
transfers, and we will get on with the future construct.
I look forward to addressing your questions and engaging in
conversations with you today. Thank you.
Mr. Gaetz. Thank you Mr. Reid.
Mr. Payne.
STATEMENT OF DANIEL E. PAYNE, DIRECTOR, DEFENSE SECURITY
SERVICE
Mr. Payne. Congressman Gaetz, Ranking Member Moulton,
distinguished members of the committee, it is an honor to
appear before you today representing the dedicated men and
women of the Defense Security Service as we absorb the
background investigation mission from the Office of Personnel
Management's National Background and Investigations Bureau.
As you know, we met with you and your staff several times
this year on the status of the investigation mission transfer.
Today, I want to provide an update on our progress since our
last meeting and my philosophy moving forward.
To set the stage, as Mr. Reid just outlined, section 925 of
fiscal year 2018 NDAA [National Defense Authorization Act]
directed that we transfer only the DOD portion of the
background investigation mission, however, commencing no later
than 1 October 2020.
DOD background investigations represent approximately
roughly 70 percent or so of NBIB's entire investigations
workload. Separately, in June of this year, the administration
announced a government reform plan which included
recommendations for streamlining the Federal Government. One of
the recommendations called for a complete transfer of NBIB to
DOD. We are awaiting an executive order that will codify the
recommendations giving the Secretary of Defense the authority
he needs to execute the entirety of the background
investigations mission and establish timelines for the NBIB-DOD
transfer.
How we conduct the transfer will be critically important.
We are expecting that the executive order will allow us to
integrate the NBIB structure into DSS [Defense Security
Service] in a way that will not reverse or impact the great
progress that NBIB has made in drawing down their investigative
inventory, while allowing DSS to continue the progress we have
made in innovation and transforming the vetting process.
As we continue to innovate and employ new measures mandated
by ODNI's [Office of the Director of National Intelligence's]
Trusted Workforce 2.0, our structure will change accordingly.
To facilitate this transfer, I am working closely with Mr.
Phalen to integrate the NBIB senior staff into DSS in order to
capitalize on their expertise and experience. We want to ensure
we have the best and the brightest minds at the table and that
we continue to build on the progress NBIB has made.
Below the senior staff levels, I know that employees of
both agencies are concerned about their jobs, their duty
locations, their chains of command. I am committed to
minimizing the disruption to both field workforces, the people
on the ground doing the work in accomplishing our mission. I
think our approach will do just that. However, let me be clear,
this transfer is incredibly complex. We are integrating two
organizations into DSS while simultaneously automating and
changing operational processes and procedures. Everyone at this
table recognizes these complexities and are resolute in
ensuring it is done successfully.
We have worked with NBIB to develop a joint transfer plan
which provides a high-level roadmap for the transfer, and we
are continuing to develop a detailed step-by-step blueprint
that will capture all of the actions necessary to complete the
transfer, touching all functional areas. We are also
establishing a joint transition team within DSS that will
implement these plans and work the myriad of details required
for a successful transfer.
While we work these transfer details, DSS is continuing its
own innovation efforts. The executive correspondence signed in
June by the Director of National Intelligence and the director
of OPM allowed us to execute new measures for certain periodic
reinvestigations and enroll them into a continuous evaluation
program. This action allowed us to reduce the number of new
cases being submitted to NBIB. It also allowed us to focus our
attention on high-risk cases and begin to develop a risk-based
approach to personnel vetting. While we are continuing to
refine our processes and business rules, we are already seeing
success in reducing the backlog and focusing our efforts on
those elevated risk individuals within our cleared workforce.
The administration's June reform plan stated: Now is the
time for bold transformation change in how we vet our
workforce. I could not agree more. I think the progress DSS and
NBIB have made this year positions us all well for success and
will truly lead to a modern risk-based, technology-enabled
personnel vetting model.
Finally, I would like to thank the members of the committee
for your continued interest in not only the NBIB transfer, but
in the important work that DSS does every day in personnel
vetting, securing critical technology, and the defense of the
industrial base, and conducting counterintelligence in order to
preserve our Nation's military and economic competitive
advantages.
With that, I am happy to take your questions.
[The joint prepared statement of Mr. Reid and Mr. Payne can
be found in the Appendix on page 18.]
Mr. Gaetz. Thank you, Mr. Payne.
Mr. Phalen.
STATEMENT OF CHARLES S. PHALEN, JR., DIRECTOR, NATIONAL
BACKGROUND INVESTIGATIONS BUREAU
Mr. Phalen. Thank you.
Representative Gaetz, Ranking Member Moulton, members of
the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to appear
before you here today. As you know, NBIB's mission is a
critical element of this Nation's efforts to ensure the
integrity and the trustworthiness of the Federal workforce. In
this role, we are the primary background investigative service
provider for the Federal Government.
Each year, this program covers over 2 million individuals
that require some type of formal investigation. These
individuals work in more than 100 departments and agencies that
are made up of civilians, military members, and contractors
from the over 15,000 companies governed under the National
Industrial Security Program.
Today, I would like to quickly address three main focus
areas that are critical to the success of this mission. Number
one, our organizational transition from OPM to the Department
of Defense, our current inventory and those mitigation efforts,
and then a glimpse into the future.
And as Garry and Dan have discussed, the successful
transfer of NBIB from OPM to DOD is critical, and we are
working closely with them daily, almost hourly, to ensure that
this is a seamless transfer. We fully support the intent
expressed in the President's Management Agenda to keep this
mission intact, and I believe this decision will ultimately be
beneficial for the whole of government.
That said, while there is a lot of focus on the future and
the transfer and on transforming this mission, we have not been
waiting for those final decisions before tackling the
challenges that we face. The future is, it has been now, and
addressing this has been foremost in our minds.
Some quick numbers. At its highest level, our inventory
reached 725,000 investigative products this past April. Looking
at the trending earlier today, I am pretty confident that
sometime in the next 24 hours that number will cross below the
600,000 mark, a reduction of over 17 percent in just 6 months.
That number 600,000 gets a lot of attention and is
sometimes misconstrued as the number of government and industry
employees waiting for a security clearance. That does not
accurately portray the number of investigations pending in our
inventory for initial national security clearances. That number
is 275,000, of which about 110,000 are already at work on an
interim clearance. While these numbers are not optimal, they
are not as high has the 600,000, and we are working closely
with our partner agencies to prioritize their more immediate
requirements.
Getting back to the overall inventory, the reduction that
we have seen so far is a direct result of the following sort of
things: First, since our standup 2 years ago, we have worked to
increase our Federal and contractor workforce to recover the
investigative capacity we lost in 2014. We have exceeded that
goal. At the same time, we introduced and implemented business
practices and process improvements to include enhancement of
technology that has enabled more efficient use of our
workforce. And as a result, we have reduced the pending field
work in our inventory by about 45 percent, reducing the
workload by more than 2 million hours in a year.
To give you an idea of some of these processes, we are
implementing robotic automation, robotic process automation,
RPA, and have deployed about 20 bots so far to streamline the
existing investigative processes. This effort will automate
manual, time-intensive activities to increase productivity and
reduce the waste and improve our timeliness. We have also
developed and implemented an approach to rapidly assess
completed cases based on a predictive model to expedite case
closure to all of our customers.
We have leveraged our strong partnerships with our
customers to focus investigative capacity around high-density
work areas. These hubs have been established around geographic
clusters of civilian, military, and industry partners, and
through this strategic approach we have more efficiently
completed hundreds of thousands of investigative items.
These are just three examples of many we have worked on.
The results of our combined effort have increased our monthly
production rate by 15 percent, closing just under 60,000 cases
every full week for the last quarter. And I expect that trend
to continue, actually to increase.
Investigative infrastructure is critical to our success. As
we work with our partner agencies, particularly the Department
of Defense that has primary responsibility to develop and roll
out the National Background Investigation Services, the future
end-to-end investigative system, it is imperative that we
continue to make efficient use of our current IT systems and
maintain the security of those systems and that data until we
transition fully into the NBIS. This will enable us to continue
working down the inventory, while also preparing and building
for that future.
Regarding that future, we are fully supportive and fully
engaged with the Trusted Workforce 2.0, the interagency effort
led by the executive agents to transform and modernize the
personnel security process. Most of the processes we employ
today are driven by policy constraints, some of which date back
seven decades, and they need to be revamped to match today's
environment and challenges. We at NBIB know from experience
there is much to be gained through the strategic policy review.
And in closing, while there is great focus on transferring
and transforming this mission, there are over 10,000 people in
the NBIB workforce, both Federal and contract support, who are
focused every day on executing this mission. It is our shared
goal that while we work to transfer and transform this mission,
our work is uninterrupted and we continue our current path to
progress.
Thank you, and I look forward to your questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Phalen can be found in the
Appendix on page 25.]
Mr. Gaetz. Thank you, Mr. Phalen.
I see Mr. Gallego has joined us, and seek unanimous consent
for him to participate as a full member of the subcommittee.
So ordered.
Mr. Reid, as this process goes forward, what will be the
metrics that we use to determine whether or not this transfer
has been successful? Will it be the duration until a decision
has been made? Will it be, you know, some customer satisfaction
metric?
You know, in my district, this is a major issue because we
have got a number of people who leave military service having
very high clearances and then they seek to go into the private
sector, and even if they have a short lapse in that time
period, it becomes as if they are a person who is tabula rasa
to the intelligence community. And so if you could speak to
that briefly.
Mr. Reid. So I would offer you a two-part answer. And
within the government, in terms of efficiency, the transfer of
functions, resources, personnel infrastructure, that will
currently reside within the Office of Personnel Management, and
transferring those to the Department of Defense, we have
developed a transfer timeline. The intent of this is to go from
the first of the year, from January, and complete those
transfers by the beginning of fiscal year 2020, through 30
September next year. So we have a 9-month window to complete
those transfers. And we are working the fine details of the
incremental transfers of those things.
Then we have a series of plans to go through, such as a
human capital, right. You have over 2,000 Federal employees
transferring from one agency to another. So as we work through
those details, we will establish a series of gates for
deliberate transfers of functions and resources. Now, that is
really inside the government.
Your question, however, was more about the external facing,
what do people see and what is the difference to the customer,
right? So that goes to two parts. One is the continued progress
that we will make working with the same people that are doing
it now but now transferred under a DOD framework to work down
the inventory. As the inventory works down, you have more
resources to apply to existing cases, so you speed up your
timeliness.
Our immediate goal right now is to get into federally
mandated timeliness standards, which are 40 days at the secret
level, 80 days at the top secret level. We are operating way
beyond that right now. But we see no reason why, through normal
process, as we get that inventory down and we have these assets
working on it, we can inch those numbers back down. But keep in
mind, the third part of the answer, is what both my colleagues
refer to, is that the executive agents are in the middle of a
process now to reexamine the entire system, and this is this
Trusted Workforce system. Some of those will be implemented
concurrent with everything I just said, and that will establish
new efficiencies and new timelines that we have yet to map out.
But the good news is for those awaiting a clearance, it will be
a faster process. It is already proving to be a faster process.
We are very confident we can get down into those guidelines and
we can probably go even further.
As we talked about this issue of reinvestigations and using
automated records check and continuous evaluation, currently,
it is a several--it is upwards of 100 days to longer to get a
reinvestigation done. Mr. Phalen said nobody is put out of work
while that is happening, but nobody likes to be in limbo,
right? As we implement the new process, you will not be waiting
on a reinvestigation. That will be a continuous process, so
that time component goes away completely. It also allows us to
focus on the front end where we do our initial into the
government, our initial checks, right.
The fact that we have this continuous evaluation,
continuous vetting framework that is now maturing as we go,
will make us more able to bring folks through the front end
investigative process knowing we are going to enroll them in a
CE [continuous evaluation] program, right, so those will all go
down.
Mr. Gaetz. Thank you. I can submit the remainder of the
majority's questions in writing for response.
Mr. Moulton, we have had votes called, and so I do not know
how many members of the minority have questions, but I am
certainly happy to proceed under the 5-minute rule and yield to
you. But if you would like to utilize any of that time to yield
to your colleagues, that would be fine as well.
Mr. Moulton is recognized for 5 minutes.
Mr. Moulton. Gentlemen, I will just ask one question, and
we will start with Mr. Reid. You know, fundamentally, I want to
understand what is the audit process for this. We have learned
a lot about continuous evaluations. We have learned about
automation. I think a lot of these innovations make sense and,
ultimately, should improve the process while also making it
more efficient.
But we are not talking about, you know, automating a
grocery store inventory here where if a few tomatoes fall
through the cracks, you just have some lost tomatoes. We cannot
let one single mole fall through the cracks here. So how are we
protecting that? How are we ensuring that we have some manual
cover backup for the automated processes as we are implementing
them for the first time?
Mr. Reid. Well, there is a couple parts to that as well.
First of all, it is very important to point out that human
beings are involved in this process every step of the way.
There is not a security clearance machine that is grinding in
the background sending out notices saying, you know, you do not
have a clearance. We have a vetting center that we have
established, that Mr. Payne has established, the director is
sitting right behind us here, and she has built up this
capability to process.
What we do now and what we will do on scale is we receive
alerts through continuous evaluation. We go through a process
to validate those alerts, right, is this a valid alert? Is this
the right person? Are we associating this alert with this
person? Is that correct? Is the identity matching? Is the
information credible? Then we go through a process to assess
the significance of those alerts and apply to them a framework
to make a decision, should this be a change in their status?
That is all monitored and regulated by people. It brings
together the adjudicative functions with investigative
functions in a new sort of dynamic fashion. That is the way we
will evolve in the future. So you will always have trained
adjudicators and trained information specialists working
together to validate and verify and validate the system that is
working properly and that action is being taken. I think to
your point on the audit side, what are you doing about this,
and are you doing the right thing based on the right
information? So we have built that now.
The challenge is to scale up for the full Department. We
are in the early months of that, but there is nothing keeping
us from extending beyond that. This will be, as we transfer
workforce, right, people that are doing things a certain way,
as we adopt new processes, then they adopt and they get trained
into those methods as well.
Mr. Moulton. This will be a question that I think will
continue to come up as we want to make sure that we understand
that not only is the process getting more efficient and the
backlog is going down, but it is just as secure or more secure
than it has been in the past.
My colleagues are going to submit their questions for the
record. I just have one more question for Mr. Payne very
quickly.
You mentioned, Mr. Payne, that you are moving to a risk-
based approach to personnel vetting. So does that mean we have
not had a risk-based approach up until this point?
Mr. Payne. Well, I would say that we have covered the board
on risk. We have done everybody at periodic--at the same
periodic point of reinvestigation, 5 years.
Mr. Moulton. So everybody has been the same?
Mr. Payne. Everybody has been the same.
Mr. Moulton. So we have not been assessing people based on
their risk to the enterprise?
Mr. Payne. There has been movements where we have elevated
people, like, for example, those who have administrative
access, administrator access for IT systems. Some agencies have
done that, but by and large, it has been a 5- and a 10-year
process, every 5, every 10 years. This gives us the
opportunity, actually, to really focus our investigative
resources on the areas where we need to focus them. So if we
are getting hits from a continuous evaluation standpoint on a
particular individual, well, maybe that is the individual we
want to focus on for a deeper reinvestigation, as opposed to
someone who we are not coming up with anything, they seem to be
leading a pretty clean life. Let's put the resources on those
individuals that are the riskiest.
Mr. Moulton. Thank you.
Gentlemen, thank you.
And, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Gaetz. The gentleman yields back.
Thank you, gentlemen. We will have additional questions we
will submit in writing, but this concludes our subcommittee
hearing, and the meeting is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 4:00 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]

QUESTIONS SUBMITTED BY MRS. HARTZLER
Mrs. Hartzler. A recent Wall Street Journal article highlighted the
difficulty that some defense contractors have in obtaining and
retaining an adequate number of cleared employees. In order to ensure
that workers have clearances by the time they join a classified
project, some companies are submitting the names of individuals for
background investigations while these individuals are still in college.
At least one company also conducts its own initial background checks in
order to expedite the official process. How might industry help to
reduce further the clearance time?

At least one company also conducts its own initial background checks in

reduce further the clearance time?
Mr. Phalen. As the primary investigative service provider to the
federal government, the National Background Investigations Bureau
(NBIB) believes there are three critical ways where Industry can
participate in improving the timeliness of background investigations;
however, this participation cannot be done unilaterally. First,
clearance sponsoring agencies determine when a company can submit an
individual for access and, typically, it is after the candidate has
been hired by the company. Programs, such as the one referenced in the
Wall Street Journal article, are currently limited in scope. It would
be beneficial if sponsoring agencies broaden the use of this approach
to allow or encourage industry case submissions earlier in the hiring
process. Second, it is NBIB's experience that most companies conduct
due diligence checks--often through a certified data provider--prior to
employment. NBIB is looking at opportunities to leverage and reuse the
data where NBIB can confirm the reliability of the source. Examples are
education and previous employment validation. The reuse of previously
collected and validated data will reduce duplication of effort,
allowing for faster investigation completion. Lastly, NBIB, working
with government agencies, is utilizing strategic geographic locations
that serve as centralized points, or ``hubs,'' to streamline the field
investigative process. These hubs provide opportunities to realize
efficiencies through the use of concentrated fieldwork, enhanced
accessibility to subjects and sources, and improved schedule
coordination. NBIB intends to expand this practice more broadly to
include Industry in this model.
Mrs. Hartzler. How is the Department handling any shortcomings
associated with databases used to monitor personnel?
Mr. Phalen. We defer this question to the Department of Defense.
Mrs. Hartzler. Are there policies or laws that need to change to
support the Continuous Vetting program?
Mr. Phalen. Executive Order (EO) 13467, as amended by EO 13764,
states in Section 2.1 that covered individuals are subject to
Continuous Vetting (CV) under standards determined by the Security
Executive Agent and Suitability and Credentialing Executive Agent
(henceforth referred to as the EAs). This gives the EAs the necessary
authority to amend or establish new national policies as needed to
improve personnel vetting processes. In spring 2018, the EAs initiated
an interagency effort to review, transform, and modernize the
government's vetting processes, known as the Trusted Workforce 2.0 (TW
2.0). As an active member of the TW 2.0 Executive Steering Group and
the Performance Accountability Council, NBIB provides input into
considerations that drive policy, guidance, and standards issued by the
EAs that serve to revolutionize the entire personnel security mission
space. This includes implementation of a robust CV program within the
Executive Branch. NBIB, as the largest investigative service provider
to the Executive Branch, supports its customers' critical need for
Continuous Evaluation (CE), an important complement to CV efforts.
Since August 2010, NBIB and its predecessor organization, Federal
Investigative Services, has offered an optional Special Agreement Check
to its customers in support of CE. Additionally, as of October 2018,
NBIB provides the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Rap Back
Service to some of its customers. This service allows agencies to
subscribe for real-time notifications of changes to an individual's
criminal record. While these services are helpful in a CV program,
additional actions are necessary to further develop a more robust and
efficient CV program. An important element of a CV program is the
timely capture of criminal history record information (CHRI).
Presently, there is a lack of automated data to detect biometric and
biographic arrest information across the spectrum of agencies,
particularly as it pertains to the level of offense. Additionally,
there is inconsistency in reporting arrest information based on the
level of offense. The FBI's Next Generation Identification (NGI) System
contains fingerprint-based arrest information. Therefore, all federal
and state agencies should ideally report all fingerprint-based arrests
to the FBI or state central record repository, as appropriate, to
establish a fully automated repository of CHRI. The personnel vetting
program would greatly benefit from the ability to leverage data from
private pre-employment screening providers who perform a series of
automated checks for private sector companies under the National
Industry Security Program. Such collection from a Trusted Information
Provider would greatly reduce duplicative work in the personnel vetting
process. However, this commercial vetting process is performed under
the Federal Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), which limits timely reuse of
this data even with consent from the applicant. Currently, the legal
community (private and federal) advises that this efficient process
would make the U.S. Government and private sector company liable for
damages because the information was provided to a third party. To
remedy this concern, an indemnification clause in the FCRA for federal
background investigations is necessary to allow this type of efficient
solution, whenever consent is provided by the applicant, to eliminate
liability in this area.
Mrs. Hartzler. What additional information technology,
cybersecurity, and infrastructure costs are expected?
Mr. Phalen. Pursuant to Executive Order, the Defense Information
Systems Agency (DISA) is responsible for building, developing,
maintaining, and protecting all information technology (IT) systems for
the National Background Information System (NBIS) that will support the
entire background investigations enterprise. Since its inception, NBIB
has played an active role in assisting DoD with the development of NBIS
to ensure its formation is inclusive of the needs of today and
tomorrow. Furthermore, NBIB is a member of the Enterprise Information
Technology Shared Service Steering Committee, which manages the NBIS
product vision and roadmaps. DoD would be best positioned to provide a
cost analysis related to NBIS. However, NBIB would note that while NBIS
is being developed and incrementally deployed, the legacy IT systems
that currently support NBIB must continue to be maintained and
protected. This activity is resourced through the NBIB revolving fund.
Continuous use of technology during the transition period and after the
mission is transferred will support the ability to reduce the
background investigation inventory in a timely manner and permit NBIB
to meet the needs of its customers.
