On page 79: Questions for the Record Submitted to Mr. Allen
Rowley
Under the heading ``Question from Ranking Member Joe Manchin
III,'' Mr. Rowley's answer refers to a spreadsheet ``that
combines the Forest Allowable Sale Quantity (ASQ) for each
national forest and the timber volume cut and sold volumes for
convertible forest products.''
The first page of the spreadsheet, which appears on page 135,
is entitled ``Summary of Forest ASQ and FY2019 Cut and Sold--
Northern Region (R1).'' The remaining pages of the
spreadsheet--Regions (R2)-(R6) and (R8)-(R10)--were
inadvertently omitted. The complete Questions for the Record
Submitted to Mr. Allen Rowley, including the missing pages of
the spreadsheet, can be accessed on the Committee's website at
