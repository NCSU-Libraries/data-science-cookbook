PENDING LEGISLATION
----------
TUESDAY, MAY 14, 2019
U.S. Senate,
Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining,
Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,
Washington, DC.
The Subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:46 p.m. in
Room SD-366, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Mike Lee,
presiding.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE,
U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH
Senator Lee. The Subcommittee will come to order. The
Subcommittee on Public Lands, Forests, and Mining is now
holding its first legislative hearing for the 116th Congress,
and I would like to welcome all of you.
As my colleagues know, the Subcommittee has jurisdiction
over public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management
and the U.S. Forest Service. This includes oversight of
activities on such lands including recreation, hard rock
mining, mineral leasing, the establishment of wilderness areas
and mineral policy in the Outer Continental Shelf.
Today's hearing agenda includes eight bills that together
cover each of these issues in several Western states and
offshore of all five U.S. territories. It is an example of the
Subcommittee's broad oversight over large swaths of federal
land and is a reminder of the fact that public lands policy has
a direct impact on the daily lives of many, many millions of
Americans.
Indeed, the Federal Government controls almost one-third of
the entire land mass of the United States making it, far and
away, the largest landowner in the nation and over 90 percent
of its holdings are located in 11 states in the West. In
contrast, the Federal Government owns 4 percent of the land
East of the Mississippi.
My home State of Utah is ranked second among all states for
the percentage of land owned and managed by the Federal
Government. In fact, two-thirds of Utah is the property of
Uncle Sam and the estate, the federal estate, within the
country is growing. Over the past five years, Congress has
appropriated more than $1 billion for land acquisition, this,
in addition to the land already held by the Federal Government.
The most recent data produced by the Congressional Research
Service (CRS) estimates that the Federal Government owns more
than 640 million acres with a maintenance backlog of $19
billion, with a B--though the CRS notes that these estimates
are incomplete. So that is one of the issues you run into when
you have a single entity owning this much land, you have to
rely on estimates about how large the estate is and even those
estimates are known and conceded to be incomplete.
Today I would like to highlight a bill sponsored by my
colleague from Indiana, Senator Braun, S. 434, that responds to
this very issue. S. 434 directs the U.S. Department of the
Interior to produce and submit a report to Congress on its land
holdings and on the cost of maintaining such lands. I believe
S. 434 will help ensure that Congress and the American
taxpayers will have a better understanding of the land that is
owned by the Federal Government, and I look forward to
discussing that bill today.
We will also hear testimony from the Administration on
three bills, that combined, would withdraw more than 700,000
acres of federal land from mineral development in Nevada and
New Mexico.
Another bill, S. 1262, the Oregon Recreation Enhancement
Act, would establish approximately 59,000 acres of new
wilderness and designate another 130,000 acres as special
management areas for recreation on O&C lands, lands originally
set aside for timber production through federal grants.
Only two bills on today's agenda would remove federal
restrictions on public land for the benefit of local
communities. The first, S. 242, would remove outdated Forest
Service timber interest on 640 acres of land in Arizona to
support public enjoyment of a historical observatory. The other
bill, S. 490, sponsored by my colleague, Senator Daines,
authorizes local residents to install a memorial plaque on a
mountain ridge in Montana to honor the death of four servicemen
who perished there in an Air Force bomber crash.
I would also like to highlight this bill which represents
life in a public land state. A community needs to go cap in
hand to Congress to ask Congress for permission to simply have
a plaque to honor servicemen who died there while serving their
country. This is the burden of having the Federal Government
own a large portion of your state. This is the burden specific
to a state where most of the land is owned by the Federal
Government. This should not be the case. This is silly. And it
ought not require an Act of Congress to do something like that,
but we will do it if that is what it takes. It is an insult to
the American people, particularly those servicemen and women
and particularly to the residents of states like that that we
have to go through this exercise.
Both S. 242 and S. 490 highlight that public lands must be
made more accessible for local uses, recognizing that there are
a whole lot of people close to where those lands are that are
more affected by how those lands are used, how they are
managed, than the people here in Washington, DC, who dictate
how they will be used.
With that, I would be turning to Senator Wyden for his
opening remarks. It looks like he is not here yet. We are also
going to give a chance to members of the Subcommittee to make
introductory remarks. While we await Senator Wyden, we are
going to hear from Senator Udall and later from Senator Braun.
Senator Udall has another committee assignment so with
consent of the Committee members, I would like to go to Senator
Udall first. And I am not just doing that because he is my
cousin, but also because I really like him.
[Laughter.]
Go ahead, Senator Udall.
STATEMENT OF HON. TOM UDALL,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO
Senator Udall. Thank you, Chairman Lee and Ranking Member
Wyden and all of the members, thank you for your courtesies.
Thank you for the opportunity to speak in favor of the
Chaco Cultural Heritage Area Protection Act and the Buffalo
Tract Protection Act, both introduced by me and Senator
Heinrich.
The Chaco Protection Act would withdraw federal lands from
future minerals development within an approximately ten-mile
radius of the boundaries of Chaco Cultural National Historic
Park in New Mexico. The entire New Mexico delegation supports
this legislation, with a companion bill introduced in the House
of Representatives by our three House members, Representatives
Lujan, Haaland and Torres Small.
Let me first briefly explain why the Chaco Canyon area is
so special. Chaco is known around the world as the heart of a
culture that inhabited the Four Corners area for hundreds of
years. The Chacoan people reached astounding architectural,
cultural and economic heights for 300 years from 850 to 1150
AD. They were master builders and engineers constructing over
150 great houses with hundreds of rooms and kivas throughout
the region. A network of roads spread in all directions and
trade relations extended into Southern Mexico. More than 3,500
archaeological sites have yielded over 1.5 million artifacts.
The remains of sites stand today, and they are magnificent.
The starkly beautiful land and mountains within the area
and the cultural sites and artifacts that pepper the landscape
are sacred to many pueblos and tribes in the Four Corners area.
These tribal nations' deep roots to the Chacoan people live on
in their communities across the Southwest, and we have several
Pueblo governors here representing all of the pueblos in New
Mexico.
Chaco has been a UNESCO world heritage site since 1987, one
of only 23 such sites in our nation. This culture represents
one of our nation's greatest pre-Columbian civilizations.
But the park covers only a fraction of the archaeological
and culturally significant sites and artifacts. Protection of
the area surrounding the national park is imperative. This area
is at real and continued risk.
Over the last three years, the Bureau of Land Management
(BLM) has proposed new oil and gas leasing in the Greater Chaco
Canyon landscape area. Each time, BLM has withdrawn the
proposals as a result of overwhelming protests from the public
and pressure from elected officials like Senator Heinrich and
me. This sacred area, home to critically important
archaeological sites and objects, should not be under constant
threat. Indeed, the Tenth Circuit recently concluded that the
Department had not adequately evaluated impacts from leases
both within and outside this ten-mile buffer. The time to act
is now.
Our bill grew from a ground swell of community-based work
over a number of years. Residents and tribal and surrounding
communities sought greater input into BLM decisions on
development in and around the area, and pueblos and tribes
wanted the meaningful government-to-government consultation the
Federal Government is obligated to conduct.
We have worked very closely with the all-Pueblo Council of
Governors, the Navajo Nation, community members and others to
craft a bill that balances cultural protection and existing
rights, including those of tribal allottees. This legislation
would withdraw only minerals owned by the Federal Government
within approximately 333,000 acres.
I also want to be clear, this bill would not affect
existing federal leases or minerals owned by private
individuals, the State of New Mexico, or tribes.
Importantly, the New Mexico State Land Office Commissioner
has issued an Executive Order placing a moratorium on new
mineral development on approximately 72,000 acres of state
trust lands within an approximately ten-mile radius of the
National Park. The State of New Mexico has aligned with our
legislation. Other private parties and tribes will be able to
make those decisions for themselves. This bill is important to
my state, our pueblos and tribes, our nation and to future
generations.
I look forward to the Subcommittee moving this bill out of
the Committee as quickly as possible so we protect this special
area for generations to come.
I also fully support the Buffalo Tract Protection Act, S.
1526, and hope it can also be reported favorably, as quickly as
possible. This legislation would withdraw four parcels of BLM
lands, including the Buffalo Tract and the Crest of Montezuma,
from mineral development.
This bill would also maintain BLM's authority over the
surface rights to the parcels. And if the surface rights are
transferred and the mineral rights will remain under federal
management and will remain withdrawn.
Like our Chaco legislation, this bill is supported by an
array of community members and tribes including the Town of
Bernalillo, Santa Ana Pueblo, San Felipe Pueblo, Las Placitas
Association, Ranchos de Placitas Property Owners Association
and La Mesa Homeowners Association.
Thank you very much for considering my views. Sorry,
Ranking Member Wyden, for jumping in front of you here, but I
am going to end.
I thank all the Committee members for their courtesies and
excuse myself to meet with my Chairman, Senator Murkowski, who
is probably mad at me at this point.
[Senator Udall's written statement follows:]
[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Senator Lee. I am sure she will be very understanding, and
you did a great job serving as the warm-up band for Senator
Wyden.
Senator Wyden.
STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON
Senator Wyden. Thank you, Chairman Lee and Senator Manchin,
in particular, and all of my colleagues. This is a pretty
hectic day by Senate standards.
I appreciate the chance to discuss legislation that Senator
Merkley and I have authored to protect and enhance three of my
state's most iconic recreation destinations.
S. 1262, the Oregon Recreation Enhancement Act would
establish two new recreation areas on the Rogue and Molalla
Rivers. These rivers are home to some of the world's most
extraordinary salmon and steelhead runs which are the backbone
of Oregon's local recreation economies.
This legislation would expand the current Wild Rogue
Wilderness Area in the rugged canyons and steep cliffs off the
Rogue River. This is truly one of the wildest and most remote
landscapes in Southern Oregon with efforts to protect and
conserve these lands persisting for over a half century when
Congress passed the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act and designated
44.5 miles of the Rogue.
Lastly, the bill permanently protects several sources of
clean drinking water from hazardous mining. The special
headwaters for the Smith and Illinois Rivers provide thousands
of Oregon families with clean drinking water and are critical
salmon habitats.
Based on the support of the local community, the Forest
Service and Bureau of Land Management issued a temporary 20-
year ban on new mining claims in the region in 2017. The
temporary ban gives Congress more time to pursue a permanent
solution. That is what this bill does. And the legislation
builds on what I call the Oregon way, our traditional
conservation ethic that has been fundamental to the livability
of my home state. The areas the legislation seeks to protect
are truly public treasures and should remain places to recreate
for generations to come.
That is why, based on local concerns, this bill ensures
that public land managers can do important preemptive forest
health and wildfire resiliency work within the recreation areas
and wilderness expansion. Making sure these landscapes are
around for future generations means hazardous fuels and
thinning work can and must continue.
I have heard all these stories about how you can't protect
special places in the West because all you are doing is getting
short shrift to the effort to deal with fire. Nothing could be
further from the truth. This Committee led the effort on
trailblazing approaches like ending fire borrowing and the list
goes on and on. But what this legislation does is it protects
special places and also makes it clear that we are going to be
all in in the fight against fire; thinning work and hazardous
fuels work can continue.
Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for the chance to be able
to jump in front of some of my colleagues. I want to thank you
and Senator Manchin and my colleagues for their courtesy.
Something tells me Senator Heinrich and I are going to end up
in the same place here shortly. I appreciate my colleagues and
ask that my full statement be part of the record.
Senator Lee. Without objection.
[Senator Wyden's full statement follows:]
[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Senator Lee. We will now recognize the Ranking Member of
the full Committee, Senator Manchin.
Senator Manchin. I yield my time to Senator Heinrich,
because I know he has to go to another meeting.
STATEMENT OF HON. MARTIN HEINRICH,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO
Senator Heinrich. Thank you very much. We have a markup in
the Intel Committee meeting, so that is why some of us will be
coming and going.
But I want to thank the Subcommittee for hearing two bills
today on issues of incredible importance to New Mexico, and I
want to thank Senator Udall for his leadership and partnership
on these two bills.
First, the Chaco Culture Heritage Area Protection Act would
protect the area immediately surrounding the Chaco Culture
National Historic Park from federal development of oil and
natural gas. This landscape is sacred to tribes across the
Southwest and tribal leaders are united in their opposition to
new development within ten miles of the park. And New Mexico's
governor, state land commissioner and the entire Congressional
delegation agree that this is the wrong place for oil and gas
production.
As development in the San Juan Basin moves further and
further south, the air pollution, dust and light pollution at
the sacred sites inside the park will only increase. And
fragile historical and cultural sites outside of the park
boundaries are directly threatened by new wells drilled without
the benefit of a cultural resource survey based on the
traditional knowledge of Pueblo and Navajo experts.
We cannot rush into development in a place this culturally
important and this complex. Preventing development in the
immediate surroundings of the park will protect irreplaceable
cultural sites and ensure that the Greater Chaco landscape
remains intact.
Mr. Nedd, in your testimony you state that it would be
premature for the Department of the Interior to take a position
on permanent protection for this area before you complete the
planning process. If that is the case, I also hope that the BLM
takes the same approach to development decisions that would
have a permanent impact on this landscape. If protection is
premature at this time, then surely development is also
premature. I hope that the BLM's plan will give this
landscape's irreplaceable cultural resources the protection
that they truly deserve.
Secondly, the Buffalo Tract Protection Act would withdraw
four small parcels of BLM land just north of Albuquerque for
mineral development. This area is already home to three gravel
mines which have negatively impacted the air and water quality
of the area. These BLM parcels act as a critical connection for
wildlife moving between the Sandia Mountains to the south and
the Sangre de Cristo Mountains to the north. These parcels also
provide invaluable recreational open space in a growing area.
The two neighboring pueblos, the county, the nearest town,
neighborhood associations and local residents all agree that
these parcels are not the right place for yet another gravel
mine.
As demonstrated by the BLM's testimony today, they are
determined to sell the gravel resource here over the objection
of local stakeholders. A legislative withdrawal will
permanently protect the wildlife habitat and recreation
resources for this community.
Thank you, again, to the Subcommittee and I yield back the
remainder of my time, Mr. Chair.
Senator Lee. Senator McSally.
STATEMENT OF HON. MARTHA MCSALLY,
U.S. SENATOR FROM ARIZONA
Senator McSally. Thank you, Chairman Lee, Ranking Member
Wyden for holding this hearing today on my bill, S. 242, the
Lowell Observatory Conveyance Act.
This is a very simple bill that will allow the Observatory
to make the infrastructure improvements necessary to update its
research capacity, enhance educational opportunities and
address important public safety concerns.
The Lowell Observatory is a world-class research and
educational observatory founded in 1894 in Flagstaff, Arizona.
The Observatory has earned global recognition for its
significant astronomical discoveries and accomplishments,
including the discovery of Pluto, mapping the moon for the
Apollo program and the first detection of the expanding nature
of the universe.
In 1910, Congress granted Lowell Observatory ownership of
the plot of land it sits on. The legislation maintained
reversionary interest on the land that stated the property
would revert back to the Federal Government if the observatory
ceased operations as well as the right to cut merchantable
timber from the plot. That is a new word I have never used
before in a sentence.
These conditions made sense in 1910 when the Observatory
was young. Flagstaff was a frontier timber town, and the land
it sat on was in the middle of the Coconino National Forest.
However, conditions today are vastly different. The Lowell
Observatory is well established with more than a century of
globally recognized research and discovery under its belt. The
property is now nearly encircled by the City of Flagstaff.
My simple, straight-forward and bipartisan bill with
Senator Sinema will remove the technical encumbrances so that
the Observatory can make the infrastructure improvements needed
for another 100 years of scientific discovery, education and
community enrichment. I am pleased to see strong community
support for my legislation and a future for the Lowell
Observatory.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask for unanimous consent to
enter into the record these six letters of support from
community leaders and organizations.
Senator Lee. Without objection.
Senator McSally. This includes Flagstaff Mayor Coral Evans,
Flagstaff City Manager Barbara Goodrich, STEM City Flagstaff,
the Economic Collaborative of Northern Arizona, Northern
Arizona Leadership Alliance and the Coconino County Sheriff's
Office.
[Letters of support for the Lowell Observatory Conveyance
Act follow:]

Senator Manchin. I am going to defer my time to my friend,
Senator Cortez Masto.

STATEMENT OF HON. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
I would like to thank the Chairman and our Ranking Member
for holding today's Subcommittee hearing and for including my
bill on today's agenda, Senate bill 258, which is the Ruby
Mountains Protection Act.
This bill would prohibit oil and gas development within the
Ruby Mountains area of the Humboldt-Toiyabe National Forest
which is located in Elko and White Pine Counties in Nevada. The
bill was created after the Forest Service received a request by
an out of state member of the public to develop 54,000 acres of
land within the Ruby Mountains. The prospect of oil and gas
leasing in the Rubies sparked a public outcry from people of
all walks of life and across the political spectrum.
The Ruby Mountains, often referred to as Nevada's Swiss
Alps, are treasured by all Nevadans with an overwhelming
majority advocating for the prohibition of oil and gas
activities. The bill is supported by the Te-Moak Tribe,
Backcountry Hunters and Anglers, Nevada Conservation League,
the Wilderness Society, Sierra Club, Patagonia, Friends of
Nevada Wilderness, and the Sportsmen for the Rubies which is a
coalition of several hunting and fishing groups, including
Trout Unlimited and the Theodore Conservation Partnership.
Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask a unanimous consent to
have the letters of support from these organizations entered
into the record.
Senator Lee. Without objection.

Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
This area of my home state is truly a hidden gem. The
landscape and outdoor recreation opportunities bring thousands
of visitors from across the state, the country and the world.
After receiving over 10,000 comments in near unanimous
opposition, the Forest Service, just last week, formally
rejected the oil and gas development proposal saying that
leasing is not an appropriate activity in the Rubies noting the
very low potential for oil and gas in this particular area.
Our local Forest Service administrator noted that any
economic benefits from the drilling would be limited compared
to the money the natural resources contribute to the area
economy through tourism, recreation and livestock grazing.
However, it is necessary to enact Senate bill 258 in order
to permanently protect the Ruby Mountains from any future
attempt to develop this land for oil and gas purposes. It is
important that we recognize there are certain areas where
certain development is not appropriate. It is not wanted and
should be formally set aside for preservation and
prioritization of other land management purposes, and that is
exactly what this bill sets out to do.
Enacting the Ruby Mountains Protection Act will not only
preserve these great public spaces and scenic landscapes
enjoyed by thousands of Nevadans and visitors each year, but it
also preserves the recreational opportunities, outdoor economy,
rare wildlife and plant life and the local culture that these
beloved mountains support. It is imperative that the Ruby
Mountains be preserved from potential oil and gas development.
Thank you.
Senator Lee. Senator Manchin.
STATEMENT OF HON. JOE MANCHIN III,
U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA
Senator Manchin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this
hearing this afternoon.
Most of the bills on today's agenda address issues of
importance in the home states of the sponsoring senators,
although two address broader policies. These bills cover a
range of issues from protecting important wildlife habitat and
cultural areas from potential mineral development to providing
for important outdoor recreation and hunting opportunities,
providing authority for renewable energy development in U.S.
territories and addressing the local land management issues. I
understand the Administration has expressed concerns with the
bills proposing to withdraw certain public lands in New Mexico,
Oregon and Nevada from mineral development. But I think the
sponsors have identified important cultural areas and habitat
that merit protection. I look forward to working with the
sponsors and my colleagues to find a way to move these bills
forward.
I was interested to see Senators Daines and Tester's bill
to authorize a plaque to be installed on national forest land
in Montana to honor four Air Force servicemen who were killed
in a 1962 plane crash. One of them was Lieutenant Fred
Hixenbaugh, and he was from West Virginia. I know the family,
and there are an awful lot of Hixenbaughs in West Virginia.
Authorizing a plaque to honor these men is a fitting tribute,
and I look forward to moving this bill through Committee also.
I wanted to come to the hearing this afternoon to let my
colleagues know that I want to work with Chairman Murkowski and
the bill sponsors to address any concerns that are raised
during the hearing so that we can find a way to ultimately have
these bills reported by the full Committee with bipartisan
support.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Lee. Thank you, Senator Manchin.
We will now hear from Senator Mike Braun who is here to
talk to us about his bill.
STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE BRAUN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM INDIANA
Senator Braun. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity
to appear before the Subcommittee in support of my Senate bill
434 on Public Lands.
This legislation instructs the Department of Interior to
produce a one-time report to Congress pertaining to federal
ownership of lands and, most importantly, the resources the
Federal Government expends on maintenance.
As a lifelong conservationist, I believe that we must be
good stewards to our public lands. They provide immense
opportunity for recreation, public education and conservation.
However, the government does a poor job at maintaining this
natural resource. Current estimates suggest that our nation has
a backlog of maintenance on our public lands of more than $19
billion, $19 billion. The statistics currently included in
government reports and budget requests are just inadequate.
For example, the '18 budget request for the Department of
the Interior used a maintenance backlog number from 2016. That
report estimated that the backlog across the Department was
only $15 billion, a number that likely greatly underestimates
the true need.
This is why Congress needs to instruct the Department of
the Interior to prepare a full report on this issue. This is
why Congress should swiftly pass Senate bill 434.
Anything of proportion in this, anywhere across the
spectrum of government or business with holdings this large and
being uncertain about what it costs for the upkeep or the
maintenance would be unheard of. And my proposals, Mr.
Chairman, build off your strong record on this issue. In my
opinion, Congress has an obligation to conduct comprehensive
oversight of our federal lands, and I believe that my bill
provides Congress the necessary information needed to fulfill
this obligation.
Thank you.
[The written testimony of Senator Braun follows:]
[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] T7306.040
Senator Lee. Thank you, Senator Braun.
It is now time for us to hear from our two witnesses. We
have two witnesses appearing before the Subcommittee today. The
first is Mr. Frank Beum, the Acting Associate Deputy Chief of
the U.S. Forest Service, and the second is Mr. Mike Nedd, the
Deputy Director for Operations at the U.S. Bureau of Land
Management.
At the end of the witness testimonies, members will be able
to ask questions so that the millions of viewers watching on TV
will be able to watch that and we will be able to enter that
for our record. Your full written testimony will be made part
of the official Subcommittee record. Please keep your
statements limited to five minutes so that we will have time
for questions. I look forward to hearing your testimony.
Mr. Beum, we will go with you first.
STATEMENT OF FRANK R. BEUM, ACTING ASSOCIATE DEPUTY CHIEF,
NATIONAL FOREST SYSTEM, USDA FOREST SERVICE
Mr. Beum. Thank you.
Mr. Chairman and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for
inviting me to share the Administration's position on several
bills that would affect the Forest Service.
To start with, S. 242, the Lowell Observatory Conveyance
Act, would direct us to convey land owned and occupied by the
Lowell Observatory near Flagstaff, Arizona. Because of the
timber reservation and reversionary clause established in the
1910 Act, there isn't an appropriate authority that would allow
the agency to process the Observatory's request to remove the
timber reservation and convey the United States' reversionary
interest. If this bill were enacted, it would provide the
authority needed to complete the conveyance to the Observatory.
The Forest Service has no concerns with and does not oppose S.
242.
S. 258 would prohibit the Department of the Interior from
issuing oil or gas leases on National Forest System land in the
Ruby Mountains Ranger District on the Humboldt-Toiyabe National
Forest in Nevada. In March the agency released a Draft Record
of Decision, including that no leasing should occur on a
portion of the Ruby Mountains Ranger District due to the low
potential for oil and gas resources because of unfavorable
geologic conditions. On May 7th, as has been mentioned, the
``no leasing'' decision was signed by the Forest Supervisor.
The Department notes that administrative tools such as the
environmental analysis completed on this proposal are available
to inform these types of decisions. With such agency and
community interaction leading to successful outcomes using
existing authorities, the Department believes this bill is
unnecessary.
S. 490 would designate a currently unnamed mountain ridge
located on the Gallatin National Forest as the ``B-47 Ridge.''
The bill would also authorize a plaque memorializing the 1962
crash of a B-47 to be placed on this ridge. The plaque would
honor the four-man crew that perished in the crash. The
Department supports honoring the brave individuals who served
our country and died tragically in this ridgetop crash.
S. 1262, the Oregon Recreation Enhancement Act of 2019,
would expand an existing wilderness boundary, establish two
national recreation areas and permanently withdraw two areas of
federal land from the mining laws of the United States to
protect them from new mining claims, other mineral leasing and
geothermal leasing.
In Section 3, the national recreation areas would consist
only of BLM lands so we defer to the Department of the
Interior. We would like to better understand what lands are
covered under Section 4, the Expansion of the Wild Rogue
Wilderness Area. Given the scale of the map referenced in the
bill, it is unclear if any acreage of National Forest System
land is included in the proposed expansion. We would like to
work with the Committee and the BLM to develop a detailed inset
map in the legislation to ensure the boundaries between the BLM
and the Forest Service parcels are clear and unambiguous. And
then finally Section 5 proposes a mineral withdrawal for two
areas known as Rough and Ready and Baldface Creeks, and Hunter
Creek and Pistol River Watershed--Headwaters, that total nearly
96,000 acres of National Forest System lands.
In 2016, the Assistant Secretary of the Interior for Land
and Minerals Management administratively withdrew these lands
for a 20-year term so Congress might consider legislation to
permanently withdraw these areas.
Now, the Forest Service is completing a Surface Use
Determination as part of the process to determine valid
existing rights within the withdrawal area. We expect to
complete the determination by this August.
In conclusion, delivering dependable energy, economic
benefits and providing jobs for rural communities while
restoring ecosystems is a top priority of our agency. We would
be interested in working with the sponsors and the Subcommittee
to address the specific concerns noted in our testimony to
accomplish our shared multiple use goals for National Forest
System lands.
This concludes my testimony, Mr. Chairman. I would be happy
to answer any questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Beum follows:]

Senator Lee. Thank you very much.
Mr. Nedd.
STATEMENT OF MICHAEL NEDD, DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR OPERATIONS,
BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR
Mr. Nedd. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, certainly Mr.
Ranking Member in his absence and Senator Cortez Masto, members
of the Subcommittee.
Thank you for the opportunity to present testimony today. I
am Michael Nedd, the Deputy Director for Operations of the
Bureau of Land Management.
I will briefly summarize the written statements concerning
the four BLM related bills on today's agenda.
S. 434 requires the Secretary of the Interior to prepare
and submit to Congress a report that describes all federal land
holdings under the jurisdiction of the Department and the total
cost of maintaining these federal land holdings for each of
Fiscal Years 2017 through 2019. The bill further requires that
this report be submitted within 120 days of the delivery of the
FY 2020 President's budget request to Congress. While the
Department supports the bill's goals of ensuring accurate and
timely data of federal land holdings, we would like to work
with the sponsor and the Subcommittee on a few modifications
that we believe would aid in implementation.
S. 526, the Buffalo Tract Protection Act, would subject to
valid and existing right to withdraw approximately 4,200 acres
of federal minerals estate near the growing population area of
Placitas, New Mexico, from all form of mineral development. The
Department notes that the population of the Albuquerque metro
area, which includes Placitas, is expected to nearly double
within the next 25 to 30 years and federal minerals will be an
important source of minerals--of materials for future
infrastructure needs. The Department supports approaches that
could protect high-value resources while still accommodating
uses and activities permitting on BLM managed land. We would
like to work with the sponsor on modification to this bill in a
way that would ensure a full range of uses for this area.
S. 1079, the Chaco Canyon Heritage Protection Act, would
withdraw approximately 201,000 federal surface acres and
approximately 334,000 acres of federal subsurface mineral
estates surrounding the Chaco Cultural National Historical Park
in Northwestern New Mexico from public land mining, minerals
and geothermal leasing laws. In FY 2018 the total revenue
generated from responsible mineral development on federal lands
in New Mexico alone was over $1.3 billion. The Secretary also
recognizes there are some places that may benefit from
protection. Striking the appropriate balance for public land
use is an important mission that the Department takes
seriously. We would like to work with the sponsors to identify
the best approach to protecting this special area as the BLM
continues to evaluate and update its land management plan.
S. 1262, the Oregon Recreation Enhancement Act, would
establish two new recreation areas and expand the existing
wilderness, Rogue Wilderness, on intermixed O&C land and public
domain forest managed by the BLM in Western Oregon. As required
under existing law, the BLM manages its own land to provide a
permanent source of timber, protected watersheds, contribute to
economic stability for local community and provide recreational
facilities. S. 1262 would also withdraw approximately 101,000
acres of federal land managed by the Forest Service and the BLM
in Southwestern Oregon. The Department would like to work
forward with the sponsor on modification to the bill to
increase public access, facilitate outdoor recreational
opportunities and reduce potential impacts to management and
harvest of timber and other forest products.
Finally, the Department will submit a statement for the
record on S. 499, the Offshore Wind and Territories Act. The
Bureau of Ocean Energy Management would be happy to respond for
the record to any question you may have on S. 499.
[The written statement referred to follows:]
[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Mr. Nedd. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify,
and I am happy to answer any questions you may have on the
other four bills.
[The prepared statements of Mr. Nedd follow:]
[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Senator Lee. Thank you very much to both of you. We will
now begin alternating five-minute rounds of questions.
Mr. Nedd, I would like to start with you. You heard Senator
Braun speak a moment ago about his bill, S. 434. You made
reference to it. Senator Braun's proposal is something that I
would support, because it will help the American taxpayer
understand the cost of maintaining this massive federal estate.
If the bill advances to markup, I would like to see the
legislation amended so as to include Forest Service holdings as
well as BLM holdings.
Now Senator Braun mentioned the Congressional Research
Service tells us that the total amount of federal landownership
in your respective agencies is not definitively known. I would
like to ask each of you whether you agree with that statement
and, if so, why is that the case? We will start with you, Mr.
Nedd.
Mr. Nedd. Well, Senator, the BLM, or the Department of the
Interior, I should say, certainly with the Bureau of
Reclamation, the National Park Service, the Fish and Wildlife
and BLM, we do have records that suggest at least closely the
land holdings we have. So within the BLM we have about 245
million acres of land, and every year in our public land
statistic we do publish those lands, including any lands that
may have moved out of federal ownership or into ownership.
Similarly, the Park Service and the Fish and Wildlife and BOR
keeps records.
Senator Lee. So would you say that the amount of land under
the management of BLM is, in fact, definitively known?
Mr. Nedd. I would say it is known, yes, Senator.
Senator Lee. Okay.
How about you, Mr. Beum?
Mr. Beum. Yes, we manage 193 million acres, roughly, of
National Forest System lands. And again, we publish on an
annual basis our land status. I believe we know what our land
status is, yes, sir.
Senator Lee. Okay.
So if I am understanding you both correctly, you would be
saying that the uncertainty would not be as a result of Forest
Service or BLM, it would be through some other federal agency,
that that is where the uncertainty lies?
In other words, what you have both just told me is that the
total number of land under your management in your respective
agency is definitively known whereas CRS said the total amount
of the federal estate, the total number of acres in the federal
estate, is not definitively known.
Mr. Nedd. Well, Senator, in my testimony or in my written
statement, certainly the Department listed in here where they
knew what the lands for the Bureau of Reclamation at 7.8
million acres. The lands that are managed within the Fish and
Wildlife at 150 million acres--I'm sorry, the Fish and Wildlife
of 80 million acres and the Bureau of Reclamation at 7.8 and
the BLM at 245. So I think in my statement there's those
figures and I would say the Department of the Interior land
management agency is aware of the lands they have.
Senator Lee. Okay.
Mr. Nedd, I want to move on to S. 1079, Senator Udall's
bill. It is a bill that its message is protecting Native
American cultural resources from horizontal drilling. But
within the proposed 1,400 square mile buffer zone it would set
allotments of Navajo Tribal members. For some allotees, the
mineral development may be a significant source of income in an
otherwise economically disadvantaged region. For many, it
certainly is a source of employment.
So first I would like to ask about the purported necessity
for this legislation. As part of the regular administrative
process for proposed oil and gas leases, isn't the BLM already
required by law to consult with tribes and to conduct cultural
resource clearances?
Mr. Nedd. Yes, Senator.
Senator Lee. And if that is the case, is there really any
threat to those resources currently or anything inadequate
about that process that is already in place?
Mr. Nedd. Senator, right now we're going through a land use
or a land amendment process. And so, we're consulting with the
tribe and at the end of that process it will reveal if there is
any potential impact on how to mitigate it.
Senator Lee. Okay.
Do you know, does the BLM have any idea how many Navajo
allotments might be inside of this proposed 1,400 square mile
buffer zone?
Mr. Nedd. Senator, I don't have that information here with
me, but I would love to take that back as a question for the
record.
Senator Lee. Okay.
Do you know how tribal allotees and horizontal drilling on
allotted lands might be affected by the protection zones and by
this legislation that creates them?
Mr. Nedd. Senator, it's my understanding that tribal and
allotees would not be affected by this withdrawal. However,
there will be challenges given the intermixing of public,
tribal and private land and, of course, the geography of the
lands.
Senator Lee. Do you have any idea whether any economic
analysis has been done to quantify or in any way estimate the
impact the protection zone might have on local jobs, including
the impact on the tribal economy?
Mr. Nedd. A social economic analysis would have been done
for the plan, but I don't have that information with me here,
Senator.
Senator Lee. Okay, but you believe one has been done?
Mr. Nedd. To some degree, I would believe, yes, Senator.
Senator Lee. Okay.
Alright, I see my time is expired.
Senator Cortez Masto.
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Beum, I want to talk to you a little bit about Senate
bill 258, which is the Ruby Mountains Protection Act. So help
me understand how the Forest Service says one day that oil and
gas leasing is not an appropriate activity there, but then the
next day you oppose a bill that says oil and gas leasing in
that same area is not appropriate activity?
Mr. Beum. Yes, ma'am.
So we conducted an analysis on, as you mentioned, 54,000
acres of the Ranger District. That proposed action was brought
to us by the BLM from an expression of interest from a member
of the public. So that's how we did our analysis based on that
specific proposal.
So I guess what we're saying in our testimony is that we
would use a similar proposal or similar process, environmental
analysis or assessment, to analyze a substantive proposal, so--
--
Senator Cortez Masto. Right. But you have already
determined that oil and gas leasing is not appropriate there.
In fact, you issued a press release saying the analysis
revealed unfavorable geologic conditions in the area, meaning
there is little to no potential of oil and gas resources in the
area. So why not make it permanent? Why go through this process
again? Because literally this Act in this legislation makes it
permanent, correct?
Mr. Beum. Correct.
Senator Cortez Masto. And what you are doing does not
necessarily make it permanent. You are going to have to go
through the process all over again if a request is made to look
into oil and gas, correct?
Mr. Beum. Yes, that's correct.
Senator Cortez Masto. And you are going to have to spend
taxpayer funds to do that, correct?
Mr. Beum. Correct.
Senator Cortez Masto. Right.
So there is a difference between--this is not an
unnecessary bill. This is necessary because it makes it
permanent, what you have actually, already determined, correct?
Mr. Beum. Yes, ma'am.
Senator Cortez Masto. Okay.
So I guess that is why I am confused. Instead of coming in
here either supporting it or remaining neutral, why are you
coming in and saying it is unnecessary because that just does
not make sense to me. I guess I am more concerned about this
Administration, particularly, playing politics with this
instead of doing the right thing.
Again, this is supported by Nevadans. It is supported by
outdoorsmen and recreational folks. It is a benefit to the
economy. It is something that even your Forest Service
administrator on the ground has said. That is why you ruled oil
and gas leasing is not appropriate.
Let me ask you this. The legislation that is before you
does not prohibit mineral development, correct?
Mr. Beum. Your legislation?
Senator Cortez Masto. Correct.
Mr. Beum. It withdraws the land from minerals.
Senator Cortez Masto. For oil and gas leasing.
Mr. Beum. For oil and gas, yes, ma'am.
Senator Cortez Masto. But it does not prohibit mineral
development if somebody decides they want to look into that,
correct?
Mr. Beum. Yes.
Senator Cortez Masto. Right.
So the idea that I am hearing that somehow this also
prohibits mineral development, that is an incorrect statement
that I have heard today, correct? It is incorrect.
Mr. Beum. I believe that's true.
Senator Cortez Masto. Too many corrects for you.
Mr. Beum. Yup.
Senator Cortez Masto. Yes.
So let me just verify, just say this, the Act only talks
about oil and gas leasing and it is the decision that you have
already determined. It makes it permanent. What you are doing
does not make it permanent. In fact, you would waste more
taxpayer dollars if you are asked to review it and have to look
at the same area again, correct?
Mr. Beum. Yeah, the Department believes we have
administrative tools to analyze a future proposal. That's where
the Department's----
Senator Cortez Masto. Which is unnecessary in this case.
You have made a determination. This makes it permanent. And
that is all I am asking for.
Thank you.
Mr. Beum. I understand.
Senator Lee. Senator Daines.
Senator Daines. Thank you, Chairman Lee.
Mr. Chairman, today I get the privilege to discuss an
important bill to my state, Senate bill 490, the B-47 Ridge
Designation Act.
This bill designates an unnamed ridge, B-47 Ridge, in honor
of four servicemen who lost their life in a plane crash in Park
County, Montana. That is not too far away where I grew up.
This is the same area, incidentally, that we protect
through the Yellowstone Gateway Protection Act which was signed
into law earlier this year by President Trump. This bill also
allows the dedication of a memorial plaque at the site of the
crash, so this accident will never be forgotten.
On July 23rd, 1962, a B-47E Strategic Air Command Bomber,
originating from Dyess Air Force Base in Texas, was performing
a routine training mission while over the skies at Paradise
Valley in Montana, just south of Livingston. The normal routine
flight plan had the plane at 23,000 feet over Dillon, Montana,
when the last communication came in from the crew. Soon after,
the B-47 bomber crashed into the southwest slope of Emigrant
Peak, killing all on board. Captain Bill Faulconer, Lieutenant
Lloyd Sawyers, Lieutenant David Sutton and Lieutenant Fred
Hixenbaugh all tragically lost their lives serving our country
that day in 1962. And these men came from all across our great
nation, from West Virginia, from Kansas, from Texas, from
Oklahoma. In fact, if you were to hike up to that site today
you will still see debris scattered on the grounds and the
still-scorched trees, but there is no designation plaque or
explanation for the visitor to know the story of these brave
men.
Only Congress and the U.S. Geological Survey have the power
to name unnamed geological features. However, USGS cannot
authorize a memorial plaque to honor the fallen. Congress can,
and as we are doing here today. That is why I introduced the
bipartisan B-47 Ridge Designation Act.
So you can see looking up here the pictures of the
servicemen that lost their lives and some of the debris that is
in the crash site.
[The photographs referred to follow:]
[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Senator Daines. This tells the story of these brave men and
ensures the sacrifice is never forgotten so their families,
their friends, visitors to this ridge will see what happened on
that tragic day. After over half a century, I believe it is
time that these men are memorialized for their service.
This bill is supported by Montana's entire Congressional
delegation, Senator Tester and myself as well as Congressman
Gianforte, who is going to champion that bill on the House
side. It is also supported by the families of the fallen men
and, importantly, the local elected officials and the community
as a whole.
Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to add their support
letters to the record.
Senator Lee. Without objection.
[Letters of support for Senate bill 490 follow:]
[GRAPHICS NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Senator Daines. Mr. Beum, question.
My legislation allows the dedication of a memorial plaque
at the site without using taxpayer dollars. It is my
understanding the Forest Service was unable to approve a permit
for a memorial as it was against policy.
With my legislation will the families now be able to place
a memorial plaque to honor these men?
Mr. Beum. Yes, Senator.
Senator Daines. Thank you.
I look forward to voting this bill out of Committee, Mr.
Chairman, and getting it signed into law as soon as possible.
I yield back my time.
Senator Lee. Thank you, Senator Daines.
Senator Heinrich.
Senator Heinrich. Thank you, and Senator Daines, I look
forward to supporting your legislation.
Mr. Nedd, do you believe the BLM's consultation with tribal
officials thus far has been sufficient in the case of Chaco
Canyon and the leasing in the area?
Mr. Nedd. Senator, based on the information I've been
given, it's ongoing consultation. So, I'm not in a position to
say if it's sufficient as yet since it's ongoing.
Senator Heinrich. I appreciate that answer.
Mr. Chair, I would urge you, relating to your question to
Mr. Nedd about the adequacy of the consultation process to also
ask the tribes that same question, because I think they would
share a different perspective than what you heard earlier in
this hearing.
The unfortunate truth of our current consultation policy is
that it only requires agency officials to meet with tribal
leaders. It does not require the agency to listen to what they
have to say or to incorporate their concerns into the
management plan. So I would ask Mr. Nedd once again, how is the
BLM incorporating the information that you have learned from
tribal consultation meetings thus far into the upcoming
management plan?
Mr. Nedd. Well, Senator, again, consultation is an ongoing
process and so the BLM takes input from the tribes or the
members and then would make adjustment accordingly. In terms of
specific changes for this plan, I could not give you that right
here since I'm not very familiar with the details of the plan.
Senator Heinrich. So, Mr. Chair, once again, I would raise
the issue that repeatedly we have seen parcels in this area
offered up for lease, a huge hue and outcry from both elected
and community officials across New Mexico, tribal officials
across New Mexico and then those get pulled back. So the
impression that that leaves many tribal leaders with is that
they are not being listened to in this case. And I think that
perspective informs why we have legislation proposed at this
time.
I want to turn to the Buffalo Tract legislation. I think we
can all agree that the parcels at issue in the Buffalo Tract
Protection Act are not typical BLM parcels, at least in New
Mexico. Three of the four are less than 1,000 acres in size
and, more importantly, they are intermixed directly among
residential development. So the consequences of mineral
development, and I will be clear, my father and my grandfather
both worked in mineral development and mining in Nevada for
many years, but including gravel mining are very different in a
residential context than in more rural or, certainly, more
unpopulated areas that the BLM largely manages. The health
impacts are more concentrated, the impact on wildlife is more
detrimental when most of the surrounding area is already built
up.
So once again, Mr. Nedd, I would just ask how the BLM took
into account the development pattern of this area when deciding
that the best use of this area is a gravel mine rather than,
for example, recreation or wildlife habitat?
Mr. Nedd. So, thank you for the question, Senator.
Normally, the BLM will start from a scoping and based on
the scoping the local community or stakeholders will identify
the issues. BLM will then proceed to do some analysis on that.
It is my understanding that with the cooperating agency
with the inclusion of tribe, BLM has been going through this
planning process to determine how best to manage the values in
that area.
Senator Heinrich. I think you very adequately described the
NEPA process in terms of moving from scoping to action.
What concerns me is that when looking at the two local
pueblos, both of them are vociferously opposed in this case.
When looking at the community groups, they are opposed. The
County is opposed. I am still looking for the community voice
that is not opposed to this particular location for a gravel
mine.
So I would just leave it at that, Mr. Chair, and I think
you have a more complete picture now for why legislation is
absolutely required in both of these instances.
Senator Lee. Thank you, Senator Heinrich. I appreciate your
insight on that.
Mr. Nedd, let's go back to you for a minute.
Turning to Senator Wyden's bill, S. 1262, the title of this
bill is the Oregon Recreation Enhancement Act. The bill would
significantly create two new roadless recreation areas. Those
are terms I don't often hear together, roadless and recreation
area, but these would total 120,000 acres. The same bill, as I
understand it, would also add 60,000 acres of new wilderness to
an existing wilderness area that is 35,000 acres, known as the
Wild Rogue Wilderness Area.
Your testimony mentioned that two of the proposed
recreation areas cover O&C lands that are part of the timber
harvest land base under the BLM's 2016 Resource Management
Plan.
Under this legislation, the Wyden bill, new roads and also
temporary roads would, if I understand it correctly, be
prohibited in the recreation areas. Is that correct?
Mr. Nedd. That is correct, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Lee. Given those restrictions, the fact that we
would be prohibiting new roads and temporary roads from this
area, what impact might those restrictions have on needed
forest management to address wildfire risk?
Mr. Nedd. Mr. Chairman, we believe the bill allows for the
treatment or the dealing with wildfire. However, timber harvest
and timber production, we think it would have a significant
impact.
Senator Lee. What kind of impact? How would you describe
what kind of loss both economically in terms of timber receipts
would the recreation area designation pose?
Mr. Nedd. Well, I think from timber receipts, I don't have
an exact number to give you, Mr. Chairman, but under the
management plan, I believe, it was about 200 or 2.7 or 2.78
million board feet or something to that effect. So it would
impact the development of that or the harvesting of that timber
and without any roads, whether it's temporary or permanent,
will not be able to get to that timber.
Senator Lee. Right. That, in turn, will have a pretty
significant impact on people who live in and around that area
and who depend on that as a source of employment. Is that
correct?
Mr. Nedd. That's my understanding, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Lee. Will you be working with local counties and
other stakeholders to continue to assess the economic impact
this might have?
Mr. Nedd. Currently we're doing an analysis. So yes, it
would include speaking with stakeholders, that would include
county.
Senator Lee. Okay.
Interestingly enough, notwithstanding its name, in
reviewing the purpose of these recreation areas, the purpose is
measured by the intended effect of them, it does not appear to
be focused on recreation. Based on BLM's reading of the
legislation, does the BLM have a clear understanding of what
recreation uses and purposes would be covered in those
recreation areas?
Mr. Nedd. Mr. Chairman, I think we would like to work with
the sponsor to clarify the language. However, we believe if it
was designated, it would prohibit access to trailheads. It
would prohibit access to scenic areas. And as America gets
older, America needs to have a different way to reach to those
destination points. So we would love to work with the sponsor
to clarify and understand better what would be impacted.
Senator Lee. Right.
The bill also withdraws hundreds of thousands of acres from
mineral exploration and mineral development. And while this
excludes existing mineral rights, what can you tell me about
what guarantees those leaseholders have that the other
restrictions, especially the limited road access, would impact
their ability to develop their claims?
Mr. Nedd. So, Mr. Chairman, the bill recognizes valid and
existing rights, so a valid and existing right, assuming if
it's a mineral and its validity is passed, the BLM will have to
work with the client to provide access to it. So my
understanding is if there's a valid and existing right, they
would be able to develop that right.
Senator Lee. Okay. And that protection extends to and
includes their ability to access it, notwithstanding the
roadless provisions.
Mr. Nedd. If it's valid and existing, yes.
Senator Lee. Okay.
I want to talk to you next about the Buffalo Tract
Protection Act, S. 526.
This is a bill that would withdraw about 4,000 acres of
four parcels of BLM land, known as the Buffalo Tract, from sand
mining and gravel mining. This is a small area that was
appraised as including approximately 36 million tons of mainly
red dog shale, the kind of rocks used for maintaining hiking
trails and replacing grass lawns with rock yards in the
southwestern region of the United States.
Population growth in Albuquerque is booming which means
that new homes and trails need nearby sources of gravel. If the
gravel in the Buffalo Tract were put up for sale, would BLM
expect it to be competitively bid?
Mr. Nedd. We believe, yes, Senator, yes, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Lee. In fact, do you know of companies that would
likely be interested in it?
Mr. Nedd. My understanding is there is interest in the
area.
Senator Lee. Okay. How much value is this resource? Is it
something you would describe as substantial?
Mr. Nedd. I would call it significant.
Senator Lee. Certainly not de minimis, not something to be
cast aside.
I also want to talk about the Ruby Mountains Protection
Act,
S. 258.
The Forest Service geological analysis of the Ruby
Mountains determined that oil and gas potential for the area
was one that they would describe as ``low to no potential.'' Is
that right?
Mr. Beum. Yes, Mr. Chairman.
Senator Lee. And the Forest Service also recently rejected
BLM's request to examine the suitability of the opening of the
area to development. Is that accurate?
Mr. Beum. Yes, the Forest Supervisor issued a decision last
week confirming the ``no leasing'' alternative.
Senator Lee. Have any local interests objected to the
Forest Service's rejection of the oil and gas leasing in the
Ruby Mountains?
Mr. Beum. Mr. Chairman, we have not. We did not receive any
objection to the decision opposing the ``no leasing''
alternative.
Senator Lee. Okay.
This has been very helpful. I want to thank you both for
coming here.
We will keep the record open for two weeks so that members
can supplement the record or ask additional questions.
I want to thank you both for your service and for your
willingness to come and testify today.
We stand adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 3:48 p.m. the hearing was adjourned.]
