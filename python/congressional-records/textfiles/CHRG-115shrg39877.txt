NOMINATIONS
TO THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
----------
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 14, 2018
U.S. Senate,
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 9:35 a.m. in room
SH-216, Hart Senate Office Building, Hon. John Thune, Chairman
of the Committee, presiding.
Present: Senators Thune [presiding], Inhofe, Wicker, Blunt,
Moran, Lee, Heller, Cruz, Fischer, Moore Capito, Sullivan,
Young, Nelson, Cantwell, Klobuchar, Tester, Udall, Blumenthal,
Schatz, Baldwin, Markey, Hassan, and Cortez Masto.
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN THUNE,
U.S. SENATOR FROM SOUTH DAKOTA
The Chairman. Good morning. Today we welcome four nominees
to testify before the Committee as we consider their
nominations to serve as Commissioners of the Federal Trade
Commission.
Joseph Simons has been nominated to serve as a Commissioner
and FTC Chairman. His credentials are impressive. Mr. Simons
served as the FTC's chief antitrust enforcer, among other
positions at the Commission. Most recently, he served as
Partner and Co-Chair of the Antitrust Group at the law firm of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton, and Garrison.
Christine Wilson is an antitrust and consumer protection
attorney, who most recently served as Vice President for
Regulatory and International Affairs at Delta Airlines. Among
her other credentials, she too has worked at the Commission
before serving as Chief of Staff to the FTC Chairman Tim Muris
during the George W. Bush administration.
Noah Joshua Phillips is a familiar face to many of us, as
he currently serves as Chief Counsel to Senator John Cornyn,
where he advises on issues including antitrust, consumer
privacy, and intellectual property.
Finally, Rohit Chopra. While not an attorney steeped in
competition law, Mr. Chopra does have extensive experience in
government service and as a consumer advocate. He currently
serves as a Senior Fellow at the Consumer Federation of
America, and previously served in senior roles at both the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the U.S. Department of
Education.
Thank you all for being here, and welcome to your friends
and families who are also joining us.
The FTC is not the largest or most well-known agency under
this Committee's jurisdiction, but it is arguably one of the
most influential, given its mission to oversee competition and
consumer protection across broad swaths of the American
economy.
The FTC was founded in 1914 by the direction of Congress,
and for more than a century, the Commission has evolved
alongside changing market dynamics and consumer preferences.
The agency was borne out of concern at the time that more
needed to be done to ensure competitive markets in the United
States and to ``bust the trusts'' that threatened that
competition. The Commission's focus soon expanded to include a
mandate to enforce against unfair and deceptive acts and
practices that threaten consumers.
A common theme bridging the Commission's dual focus on
competition and consumer protection is ensuring freedom in the
marketplace.
Over its history, and on balance, the FTC has been a strong
cop on the beat ensuring that Americans reap the benefits from
a functioning economy, not one dominated by firms with unfairly
concentrated market power. The FTC has also made it possible
for Americans to be confident in their transactions, to spend
freely, and grow the economy with the knowledge that they are
largely protected from the fraudsters and cheats who would do
them harm.
But the agency has not been without controversy. In the
late 1970s, for example, the agency drew criticism for its
consideration of a regulation that would have imposed major
restrictions on television advertisements aimed at young
children in order to reduce the amount of sugar that children
eat. This regulatory overreach led the Congress to advance
heightened procedural safeguards on the Commission's authority
to promulgate rules, and led one media outlet to criticize the
Commission as the ``great national nanny.''
The Commission's assertiveness and the breadth of its
jurisdiction have earned the FTC other nicknames as well. More
recently, the agency has been called the ``Federal Technology
Commission.'' That nickname is actually an appropriate one
given the Commission's increased focus on the American tech
sector and the growing influence of Silicon Valley on the
American economy. It is my expectation that the FTC will
continue its vigilance on this beat.
Privacy and data security, for example, will remain major
consumer protection concerns in the coming years, and issues
each of these nominees will contend with, once confirmed. The
FTC must continue to bring deception cases where it finds
material misrepresentations. And it must bring unfairness cases
where it finds substantial harm.
Once again, I want to thank all of you for testifying today
and for your willingness to fill these critical posts.
And I will turn now to our Ranking Member, Senator Nelson,
for his opening remarks.
STATEMENT OF HON. BILL NELSON,
U.S. SENATOR FROM FLORIDA
Senator Nelson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Blumenthal
has kindly agreed to step in as Ranking today since I have to
be in three places at once.
Although the Federal Trade Commission is a small agency,
it's one with a big responsibility: protecting American
consumers. Whether it involves small-time robocallers, multi-
million-dollar payday lenders, or giant Silicon Valley tech
companies, the FTC acts as a cop on the beat that polices a
whole host of unscrupulous practices that put American
pocketbooks at risk.
It's not just financial harm, public health can also be at
stake. In the past, the FTC has cracked down on cigarette
advertisements aimed at kids or on phony sports equipment
claiming to prevent concussions.
Just recently the FTC and the FDA sent warning letters to
11 companies who were touting ``opioid cessation products.''
Given the depth of the opioid crisis in our country, it's
unconscionable that anyone would prey on vulnerable families in
desperate need of help, but they do.
While the recent action by the FTC is a positive step, it
also raises serious questions about why the agency waited so
long to address this epidemic opioid crisis. Where was the FTC
all these years when drug manufacturers were making deceptive
marketing claims about the risks associated with OxyContin and
other opioids?
Given this reality, it's absolutely essential that the
agency fulfills its mission to protect American consumers in a
no-nonsense, nonpartisan, and independent manner. Unlike other
independent agencies, it has a long tradition of acting on a
consensus basis. The FTC's mission is too important for
individual Commissioners to let politics or special interests
impede the agency's law enforcement work. And if confirmed, I
expect the nominees, and I have met with them privately, to
continue the tradition of past Commissioners and work in a
constructive bipartisan and independent manner.
Finally, let me say a word about net neutrality. Simply
put, the FTC is not the agency for net neutrality. Despite the
amazing things the FTC does, it does not have the expertise,
the resources, or the authority to adopt forward-looking rules
to protect broadband consumers. The expertise is in the FCC,
and that's why you'll see a CRA coming to the Senate to restore
the FCC's critical net neutrality protections. That CRA,
though, is not inconsistent with my continuing belief that in
the long term, as I have discussed over and over while Senator
Thune and I have consulted and collaborated on this, only
lasting bipartisan net neutrality legislation with real
protections can bring the certainty necessary to fully protect
consumers and preserve the FCC's authority.
And I thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Senator Nelson follows:]
Prepared Statement of Hon. Bill Nelson, U.S. Senator from Florida
Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the nominees before us
today. We now live in a cynical time when public service is not as
valued as it once was. I commend all of you for your willingness to
overcome this unfortunate attitude and work on behalf of the American
public.
The Federal Trade Commission is America's premier consumer
protection agency. In 1914, President Wilson signed the FTC Act into
law, empowering the newly formed commission to crack down on unfair
methods of competition.
And since the law was amended in 1938 to prohibit ``unfair or
deceptive acts and practices,'' the FTC Act remains the bedrock of
American consumer protection law today.
The FTC is a small agency that has to cover a vast amount of real
estate. The pocketbooks of American consumers are under constant
assault by scams and unscrupulous corporate practices. From small-time
robocallers to multi-million-dollar payday lenders to the giant tech
companies of Silicon Valley, the FTC must take on a whole host of
commercial practices that put average working Americans at risk.
And it's not just financial harm--public health can be at stake. In
the past, the FTC has cracked down on cigarette advertisements aimed at
kids and on phony sports equipment claiming to prevent concussions.
Just recently, the FTC and the FDA sent warning letters to 11 companies
who were touting opioid cessation products. Given the depth of the
opioid crisis in our nation, it's unconscionable that anyone would prey
on vulnerable families in desperate need of help.
Given this reality, it is absolutely essential that the FTC
fulfills its mission to protect American consumers in a no-nonsense,
bipartisan manner.
Unlike other independent agencies, the FTC has a long tradition of
acting on a consensus basis. The FTC's mission is too important for
individual commissioners to bring their ideological baggage into the
agency's law enforcement work. If confirmed, I expect all of you to
continue the tradition of past FTC commissioners and work in a
constructive, bipartisan manner.
And finally, let me say a word about net neutrality. Simply put,
the FTC is not the agency for net neutrality. Despite the amazing
things the FTC does, it does not have the expertise, the resources or
the authority to adopt forward looking rules to protect broadband
consumers. That's why I support the CRA to restore the FCC's critical
net neutrality protections. That CRA, though, is not inconsistent with
my continuing belief that, in the long-term, only lasting bipartisan
net neutrality legislation with real protections can bring the
certainty necessary to fully protect consumers and preserve the FCC's
authority.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Nelson. And I would say,
``Hear, hear!'' to that last statement, and hopefully this
Committee will be able to get there in due time.
We have a couple of our colleagues we would like to welcome
to the Commerce Committee today. And they are here to introduce
a couple of our nominees. I first want to recognize the
President Pro Tem of the U.S. Senate, Senator Hatch. And he is
here to introduce Joseph Simons.
Senator Hatch, you're recognized.
STATEMENT OF HON. ORRIN HATCH,
U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH
Senator Hatch. Well, thank you so much, Mr. Chairman and
members of the Committee. I want to thank you for the
opportunity to appear.
It is my distinct pleasure to introduce Joe Simons as
nominee for Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission. We've all
been eagerly waiting for this hearing because we all know it's
high time to get things up and running again at the FTC. Though
now over 100 years old, its mission remains as critical today
as it was when first established.
The United States is the economic marvel of the world. Our
market system, in which entrepreneurs are free to build and
consumers are free to choose, has proven an engine of
prosperity without equal.
But as I need not remind members of this Committee, a free
enterprise economy will reach its full potential only so long
as institutions like the FTC keep our markets free, fair, and
competitive. Striking that balance has always been exceedingly
difficult, no less now than in the past. And so, for all the
prosperity of our system, and all the prosperity our system has
delivered, for all it promises to deliver still, today there's
a palpable anxiety about our economy and its trajectory.
Concerns are being raised about corporate consolidation and
the conduct of some of our biggest firms. Questions of data
privacy and security loom large. Thus, the next few years will
prove a critical time in the history of the FTC. The concerns
are real, the policy choices are difficult, and the pressures
brought to bear are likely to be heavy.
Ultimately, Chairman Thune, that is why I am so pleased to
be here to make this introduction. Let me say this and let me
be clear: Joe Simons is just the man this moment requires. The
President could not have made a better choice for this crucial
role.
I have to say, of course, he is superbly qualified to lead
the Commission as Chairman. He was educated at Cornell and
Georgetown Law. He served in several important posts at the
FTC, including Director of the Bureau of Competition, and was
both a partner and leader of the antitrust group at the law
firm Paul Weiss.
But more importantly than his resume, Joe Simons is also
uniquely suited, both by temperament and character, to take up
this charge. In his tenure at the FTC, on both merger and
conduct cases, he earned a reputation for skill, integrity, and
vigor. His enforcement decisions both when to proceed and, just
as importantly, when not to, reflected doctrinal expertise, a
keen sense for economics, and a practical feel for the
operation of markets. Indeed, the methods he developed have
been adopted and used by administrations of both parties and
judges of all philosophical approaches.
Once in private practice, he was called upon by both
private clients and public institutions to handle the most
difficult problems and most important and sensitive of matters.
As the FTC charts its course through the modern era, Joe
Simons' experience and stature will make him just the steady
hand that the markets, the bar, and consumers expect.
Of course, the FTC is more than just its Chairman. Before
this Committee is an excellent slate. Christine Wilson is a
recognized leader in competition law, and I have great respect
for her. Rohit Chopra is a widely regarded expert in consumer
protection. And Noah Phillips, of course, is a part of our
family here in the Senate. Consistently over the years, he has
proven a reliable counselor to Senator Cornyn as well as an
honest and productive broker in working with other Senate
offices. I know he'll make an exceptional Commissioner.
In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I commend the President on
such outstanding nominees, and I applaud this Committee for its
expedition in moving them forward. Let there be no mistake:
this is an excellent package, and it deserves bipartisan
support. Led by Joe Simons, we can trust the FTC will
faithfully fulfill its mandate and continue its tradition and
bipartisan, practical enforcement and policymaking to tackle
the challenges ahead.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for this opportunity of saying
these few words.
[The prepared statement of Senator Hatch follows:]
Introduction of Joe Simons by Hon. Orrin Hatch
Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and members of the
Committee, I want to thank you for the opportunity to appear here
today. It is my distinct pleasure to introduce Joe Simons as nominee
for Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.

The Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Hatch, my Chairman of the
Senate Finance Committee, along with Senator Cornyn and a few
others on this panel as well.
But we're also joined by another distinguished Member of
the Senate leadership, our Whip, Senator Cornyn, from Texas.
And he is here to introduce Noah Phillips.
Senator Cornyn.
STATEMENT OF HON. JOHN CORNYN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS
Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thanks to
Ranking Member Blumenthal, and the members of the Committee.
I'm honored to be here, as you've heard, to introduce an
extremely well-qualified candidate, Noah Phillips, to be a
Federal Trade Commissioner.
You've already said, Mr. Chairman, and others have
acknowledged, that Noah serves as my Chief Counsel, which is to
his great credit. Heaven knows I need all the help I can get.
And Noah has helped guide me and my legislative portfolio
through complex issues on the Judiciary Committee during his
tenure. His intellect shines most when he's faced with
technical topics that would intimidate even the most seasoned
lawyers: intellectual property, privacy issues, antitrust, and
constitutional law. But he's also shown, as Senator Hatch has
noted, a knack for building consensus with folks on the other
side of the aisle when necessary to get things done. This is
becoming increasingly rare these days, and it's one of the
reasons he has been a very valued member of my staff.
Trading judicial confirmation hearings for hearings on
proposed corporate mergers may seem like a big career change,
but Noah actually started out in the financial world in New
York City after graduating from college. After completing law
school at Stanford, Noah clerked on the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit and was located in San Antonio and came
to the realization that so many folks have when they spend time
in my state, he learned to really like Texas. We see a lot of
that.
I'll spare you the impressive list of law firms he's worked
for, but he soon found his way back to Texas and onto my staff.
His legal resume is remarkable, as is the work he's done with
the Judiciary Committee. He has worked behind the scenes on
important victims' rights laws such as the Holocaust
Expropriated Art Restoration Act and legislation to reform our
Nation's patent system.
Beyond the hearing room, Noah is a man of strong moral
character and quick wit. As further confirmation of his
bipartisan credentials, his wife, Sarah, worked for USAID and
the National Security Council during the Obama administration.
He is a devoted father to three wonderful children: Dalia,
Jonah, and Abigail--who you've already heard some from this
morning.
[Laughter.]
Senator Cornyn. And perhaps you'll hear more from as the
hearing continues.
As a Commissioner, Noah will use his even-handed manner and
experience in patent and antitrust law to better protect
consumers and competition. Capitol Hill staff may come and go,
but this is a loss that will be felt by my office and by the
entire Senate Judiciary Committee. I know that the Commission
and our country will be better off during his tenure, and I
thank you for your consideration of this deserving and well-
qualified nominee.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Senator Cornyn follows:]
Introduction of Noah Phillips by Hon. John Cornyn

And we are grateful for our colleagues' willingness to come
here and testify on behalf of the nominees. Thank you for being
here.
And I'm going to ask our nominees if they would come
forward. I'm going to recognize a member of this Committee in
just a minute, Senator Capito, to introduce one of the other
``noms'' as well, but if we could have our folks come forward,
we'll get rolling.
I want to recognize Senator Capito, and she is here to
introduce Ms. Christine Wilson.
STATEMENT OF HON. SHELLEY MOORE CAPITO,
U.S. SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA
Senator Capito. Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to thank all the nominees, but I particularly want
to thank President Trump for nominating Christine Wilson as a
nominee as FTC Commissioner to the Committee. She's an absolute
stellar candidate.
Ms. Wilson works in Washington, D.C., and lives in Falls
Church, Virginia. But she has recently purchased farmland in
Morgan County, West Virginia. Christine and her husband both
have relatives who have lived and worked in the region in the
1700s and the 1800s. So when they break ground on their house
in March, it will be something of a homecoming for them, and
West Virginians will welcome them home.
Aside from being one of my newest constituents, I would
like to highlight her work with women and human trafficking.
Included in the plans of Ms. Wilson's recently purchased
farmland in West Virginia, is her hope to open a retreat
location for victims of sexual trafficking and abuse. I commend
her for this initiative and look forward to hoping that that
comes true because that's an issue that many of us care deeply
about.
On the professional front, as you can tell from her bio,
for over 20 years, she has been an advocate of a simple but
vital truth at the heart of American economic greatness:
Competition is the best protection for consumers and the
strongest prescription for a healthy economy.
Belief that consumers benefit most from robust competition
was at the heart of Christine's work as Chief of Staff to the
FTC Chairman, Tim Muris, under President George W. Bush. And
confidence that market economies increase consumer choice and
reduce prices has grounded her many contributions to the sound
development of competition law and policy, both domestically
and internationally.
If confirmed, I know Christine will bring to bear, as an
FTC Commissioner, the extensive experience that she has gained
both in private practice and in the public sector. So I look
forward to hearing from her and the other nominees today.
And thank you, Christine, for your commitment to our
country and your public service.
Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Senator Capito follows:]
Introduction of Christine Wilson by Hon. Shelley Moore Capito
It is my pleasure to introduce Christine Wilson, nominee for FTC
Commissioner, to this Committee.
Ms. Wilson works in Washington DC and lives in Falls Church,
Virginia but recently purchased farm land in Morgan County, West
Virginia. Christine and her husband both have relatives who lived and
worked in that region during the 1700s and 1800s. When they break
ground to build a house in March, it will be something of a homecoming
for them.
Aside from being one of my newest constituents, I'd like to
highlight her work with women and human trafficking. Included in the
plans of Ms. Wilson's recently purchased farm land in West Virginia, is
her hope to open a retreat location for survivors of trafficking and
abuse. I commend her for this initiative as the issue is one I care
very deeply about.
On the professional front, for over twenty years, Ms. Wilson has
been an advocate of a simple but vital truth at the heart of American
economic greatness. Competition is the best protection for consumers
and the strongest prescription for a healthy economy.
Belief that consumers benefit most from robust competition was at
the heart of Christine's work as Chief of Staff to FTC Chairman Tim
Muris under President George W. Bush.
And confidence that market economies increase consumer choice and
reduce prices has grounded her many contributions to the sound
development of competition law and policy, both domestically and
internationally.
If confirmed, Christine will bring to bear as an FTC Commissioner
the extensive experience she has gained both in private practice and
the public sector.
I look forward to hearing from her and the other nominees today.
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Capito.
So we're going to proceed. We'll start on my left, and your
right, with Mr. Simons. And if we could ask our panelists, if
they could, to confine their oral remarks as close to 5 minutes
as possible. Your entire statements will be included and made a
part of the record. And we'll get on to our questioning.
So, Mr. Simons, please proceed.
STATEMENT OF JOSEPH SIMONS,
NOMINEE FOR COMMISSIONER/CHAIRMAN DESIGNATE,
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
Mr. Simons. Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Blumenthal, and
distinguished members of the Committee, thank you for this
opportunity to testify today. And thank you to Senator Hatch
for those very kind words. I'll do my best to live up to them.
It is truly an honor to appear before you, and especially
regarding this particular nomination. The Federal Trade
Commission is an institution that is very close to my heart.
The FTC has a great mission. It deals with fascinating and
important issues, and most importantly, it has a terrific
staff.
As I mentioned to a few of you, in some ways, it feels like
I have spent my entire professional life preparing for this
opportunity.
As a much younger lawyer back in the 1980s, I worked at the
agency as an assistant to the Director of the Bureau of
Competition. A little over a decade later, I returned to run
the Bureau of Competition at the FTC. And while in private
practice, I have for many years represented clients before the
FTC and the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice.
Throughout all that time, I never gave much thought to the
possibility that I might one day find myself before this
Committee as a nominee to lead the Commission, but personally,
I cannot imagine a greater professional honor.
Of course, none of this would have been possible without
the support of friends and family. First and foremost, I
definitely would not be here today without the love and support
of my wife, Martha. Also here with me today are my children
Jack, Sam, and his wife, Whitney; my stepchildren Jaxson,
Michelle, Lauren; my brother-in-law, Jim, and his wife, Lynn;
and several of our close friends; and my cousin, Jeff. My
daughter, Lauren, is watching from Cornell. And I can't thank
all of them enough for their support.
The Federal Trade Commission is a proud and respected
institution in Washington. Since its creation a little over 100
years ago, its work has proven critical to increasing the
growth of our economy. By vigorously policing anticompetitive
conduct and preventing anticompetitive consolidation, the
Commission can help ensure that firms compete on the merits,
providing better products and services to consumers at lower
prices. Likewise, by stamping out unfair and deceptive trade
practices, the Commission can help assure that consumers are
protected and have the information they need to make
intelligent choices in the marketplace. In sum, the FTC is all
about protecting and improving consumer welfare. And as has
already been discussed, one of the great things about the FTC's
mission historically is that it has been performed in a highly
bipartisan way.
I pledge to you today that if honored with confirmation, I
will continue to lead the FTC in that rich tradition of
bipartisan policymaking and enforcement. I look forward to
working alongside my fellow Commissioners, of both parties, to
assure that the FTC remains as effective in the start of its
second century as it did up through the end of its first.
Thank you again for this opportunity to testify. And I look
forward to your questions.
[The prepared statement and biographical information of Mr.
Simons follow:]
Prepared Statement of Joseph Simons, Nominee to be a Commissioner,
Federal Trade Commission
Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and distinguished members of
the Commerce Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today.
It is, truly, an honor to appear before you, and especially regarding
this nomination.
The Federal Trade Commission is an institution very close to my
heart. The Commission has a great mission, it deals with fascinating
and important issues, and it has a terrific staff. I've spent the
greater part of my career working on the issues at the core of its
mission, witnessing first-hand the tremendous impact the Commission can
have and the enormous good that it can do. As I've mentioned to a few
of you, in some ways it feels like I've spent my entire professional
life preparing for this opportunity. As a much younger lawyer back in
the 1980s, I worked at the agency as an assistant to the Director of
the Bureau of Competition, among other jobs in Bureau. A little over a
decade later, I returned to the FTC to run the Bureau of Competition.
And while in private practice, I have for many years represented
clients before the FTC and Department of Justice Antitrust Division.
Throughout all that time, I never gave much thought to the possibility
that I might one day find myself before this Committee as a nominee to
lead the Commission. But personally, I cannot imagine a greater
professional honor.
Of course, none of this would have been possible without the
support of family and friends, some of whom are here with me today.
First and foremost, I definitely would not be here today without the
love and support of my lovely wife Martha. Also here with me today are
my children Sam, Jack and Lauren, and my stepchildren Jaxson, Michelle,
and Lauren. Several of our close friends are here as well. I can't
thank them all enough for their support.
The Federal Trade Commission is a proud and respected institution
in Washington. Since its creation a little over a 100 years ago, its
work has proven critical to increasing the growth of our economy. The
free enterprise system works best when our markets remain free and
competitive. By vigorously policing anticompetitive conduct, and
preventing anticompetitive consolidation, the Commission can help
ensure that firms compete on the merits, providing better products and
services to consumers at lower prices. Likewise, by stamping out unfair
or deceptive trade practices, the Commission can help assure that
consumers are protected and have the information they need to make
intelligent choices in the marketplace. The FTC is all about protecting
and improving consumer welfare.
And one of the great things about this mission historically is that
it has been performed in a highly bipartisan way.
I pledge to you today that if honored with confirmation, I will
continue to lead the FTC in that rich tradition of bipartisan
policymaking and enforcement. I look forward to working alongside my
fellow Commissioners, of both parties, to assure the FTC remains as
effective in the start of its second century as it did up through the
end of its first century.
Where the agency already has the necessary tools to protect
consumers, you have my assurance they will vigorously be brought to
bear. And where a new approach may be needed, I'll be eager to work
with this Committee and its staff in finding a solution.
Thank you again for this opportunity to testify, and I look forward
to your questions. I'm humbled by the nomination, and, if honored with
confirmation, excited for the work ahead. Thank you.

17. Please identify each instance in which you have testified
orally or in writing before Congress in a governmental or non-
governmental capacity and specify the date and subject matter of each
testimony. None.
18. Given the current mission, major programs, and major
operational objectives of the department/agency to which you have been
nominated, what in your background or employment experience do you
believe affirmatively qualifies you for appointment to the position for
which you have been nominated, and why do you wish to serve in that
position?
I have worked at the Federal Trade Commission twice before, the
last time as Director of the Bureau of Competition, with
responsibilities for roughly half of the agency's mission. My tenure
there was both active and highly successful. The Commission during that
time brought more non-merger enforcement actions than in any comparable
period two decades before or since, while remaining very active in
merger enforcement as well. As a matter of personal pride, those
efforts were characterized by a high degree of bipartisanship.
In private practice, I have spent about 30 years representing
clients largely before the Federal Trade Commission and the Department
of Justice Antitrust Division, an experience which provides valuable
insights that can be applied in running the agency.
I am seeking this appointment for the following reasons. Our
country's economic potential is unmatched, and the Federal Trade
Commission has an important role to play in making sure we exploit that
advantage in a way that benefits U.S. consumers to the greatest extent
possible, and at the same time, creates more jobs. Our economy is based
largely on free enterprise, a system designed to incentive sellers to
produce the best products at the lowest prices. But such a system
requires rules of the road (and a reliable referee to enforce them) to
ensure that it stays true to its purpose. Those rules must prohibit
anticompetitive conduct and help ensure consumers are protected from
deceptive and unfair practices. The chance to play a significant role
in enabling the FTC to fulfill that mission would be a great
opportunity and honor.
Between my two prior stints at the FTC, and my experience in
private practice, I feel as though I have been essentially training for
this job since law school. Furthermore, I love the agency's mission,
the stimulating issues it deals with, and its outstanding personnel. I
am confident that I am in an excellent position to be successful as
Commissioner if confirmed.
19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to
ensure that the department/agency has proper management and accounting
controls, and what experience do you have in managing a large
organization?
I would be responsible for ensuring that the FTC has proper
management and accounting controls. In terms of experience, I was
previously Director of the Bureau of Competition and responsible for
roughly half of the agency's mission, which involved personnel
management and budgeting. I have also had managerial experience running
cell phone businesses worth over $2 billion as a trustee for the
Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission.
20. What do you believe to be the top three challenges facing the
department/agency, and why?
1. Significant concerns have been raised that the Federal antitrust
agencies have been too permissive in dealing with mergers and
acquisitions, resulting in harm to consumer welfare via increased
prices, limited consumer choice, and harm to workers. Addressing these
concerns is critical, as they lie at the heart of the agency's
competition mission. The FTC needs to devote substantial resources to
determine whether its merger enforcement has been too lax, and if
that's the case, the agency needs to determine the reason for such
failure and to fix it. Even if the evidence shows no such failure, it
would be good practice to evaluate more systematically the Commission's
merger enforcement program through the regular use of retrospective
studies to prevent potential problems in the future. It would also be
good practice to extend the retrospectives to non merger matters as
well.
2. The FTC recently conducted a study of its merger remedies and
concluded that cases involving divestitures of asset packages not
involving stand-alone businesses had a 30 percent failure rate. That
rate is too high and needs to be lowered substantially or, ideally,
zeroed out altogether.
3. Rapid changes in technology and cyber threats provide a
significant challenge to the Agency's ability to fulfill its consumer
protection mission and provide meaningful guidance to the business
community. It is critical, despite these challenges, that the FTC
protect consumers without unduly burdening them or interfering with the
ability of firms (especially small firms and new entrants) to use data
to enhance competition.
b. potential conflicts of interest
1. Describe all financial arrangements, deferred compensation
agreements, and other continuing dealings with business associates,
clients, or customers. Please include information related to retirement
accounts.
I retired from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP
effective 12/31/2017. I will receive my final partnership share
distribution as a single, lump sum payment prior to assuming the duties
of my Federal position. The total amount of the payment will be
calculated as of the date of my retirement from the partnership.
Pursuant to the firm's partnership agreement and the firm's
handbook, I have been provided an office, secretarial services, access
to a computer and computer services, and the ability to participate in
the firm's health insurance plan. Upon confirmation, I will forgo all
of theses benefits.
I will continue to participate in the Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton
& Garrison LLP defined benefit plan under which I will receive
approximately $13,154 per month beginning in 2018.
2. Do you have any commitments or agreements, formal or informal,
to maintain employment, affiliation, or practice with any business,
association or other organization during your appointment? If so,
please explain. No.
3. Indicate any investments, obligations, liabilities, or other
relationships which could involve potential conflicts of interest in
the position to which you have been nominated.
In connection with the nomination process, I have consulted with
the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and the Federal Trade Commission's
Designated Agency Ethics Official to identify potential conflicts of
interest. If confirmed, any potential conflicts of interest will be
resolved in accordance with the terms of the ethics agreement that I
have entered into with the Commission's Designated Agency Ethics
Official. I am not aware of any other potential conflicts of interest.
4. Describe any business relationship, dealing, or financial
transaction which you have had during the last ten years, whether for
yourself, on behalf of a client, or acting as an agent, that could in
any way constitute or result in a possible conflict of interest in the
position to which you have been nominated.
In connection with the nomination process, I have consulted with
the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and the Federal Trade Commission's
Designated Agency Ethics Official to identify potential conflicts of
interest. If confirmed, any potential conflicts of interest will be
resolved in accordance with the terms of the ethics agreement that I
have entered into with the Commission's Designated Agency Ethics
Official. I am not aware of any other potential conflicts of interest.
5. Describe any activity during the past ten years in which you
have been engaged for the purpose of directly or indirectly influencing
the passage, defeat, or modification of any legislation or affecting
the administration and execution of law or public policy. None.
6. Explain how you will resolve any potential conflict of interest,
including any that may be disclosed by your responses to the above
items.
If confirmed, any potential conflicts of interest will be resolved
in accordance with the terms of the ethics agreement that I have
entered into with the Commission's Designated Agency Ethics Official. I
am not aware of any other potential conflicts of interest.
c. legal matters
1. Have you ever been disciplined or cited for a breach of ethics,
professional misconduct, or retaliation by, or been the subject of a
complaint to, any court, administrative agency, the Office of Special
Counsel, professional association, disciplinary committee, or other
professional group? If yes:
a.
Provide the name of agency, association, committee, or group;
b.
Provide the date the citation, disciplinary action, complaint, or
personnel action was issued or initiated;
c.
Describe the citation, disciplinary action, complaint, or
personnel action;
d.
Provide the results of the citation, disciplinary action,
complaint, or personnel action.
No.
2. Have you ever been investigated, arrested, charged, or held by
any Federal, State, or other law enforcement authority of any Federal,
State, county, or municipal entity, other than for a minor traffic
offense? If so, please explain. No.
3. Have you or any business or nonprofit of which you are or were
an officer ever been involved as a party in an administrative agency
proceeding, criminal proceeding, or civil litigation? If so, please
explain. No.
4. Have you ever been convicted (including pleas of guilty or nolo
contendere) of any criminal violation other than a minor traffic
offense? If so, please explain. No.
5. Have you ever been accused, formally or informally, of sexual
harassment or discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, or
any other basis? If so, please explain. No.
6. Please advise the Committee of any additional information,
favorable or unfavorable, which you feel should be disclosed in
connection with your nomination.
None to my knowledge.
d. relationship with committee
1. Will you ensure that your department/agency complies with
deadlines for information set by congressional committees?
If confirmed, I would work diligently with my fellow Commissioners
to do so.
2. Will you ensure that your department/agency does whatever it can
to protect congressional witnesses and whistle blowers from reprisal
for their testimony and disclosures?
If confirmed, I would work diligently with my fellow Commissioners
to do so.
3. Will you cooperate in providing the Committee with requested
witnesses, including technical experts and career employees, with
firsthand knowledge of matters of interest to the Committee? Yes.
4. Are you willing to appear and testify before any duly
constituted committee of the Congress on such occasions as you may be
reasonably requested to do so? Yes.

Resume of Joseph J. Simons
Retired Partner (Of Counsel); Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison
LLP, 2001 K Street, NW, Washington, D.C.
Formerly, a partner and co-chair of the Antitrust Group, Joe Simons
focused on antitrust M&A, litigation and counseling. Prior to joining
Paul, Weiss, he was the chief antitrust enforcer at the Federal Trade
Commission (FTC), serving as Director of the Bureau of Competition from
June 2001 until August 2003. Under his leadership, the Commission
pursued a strong bipartisan enforcement agenda under which all but one
of the more than 70 antitrust enforcement actions taken by the agency
were by unanimous vote. During his tenure, the FTC prevailed in all of
the 46 merger enforcement actions taken by the Commission. Joe was
responsible for overseeing the re-invigoration of the FTC's non-merger
enforcement program, initiating well over 100 investigations in two
years and producing more non-merger enforcement actions in one year
than in any year in the prior two decades. He also initiated a new
emphasis at the FTC on administrative litigation, substantially
increasing the number of trials before the agency, including merger,
monopolization and horizontal restraint cases.
Experience
Joe has extensive experience representing clients before the FTC,
the Department of Justice, the Department of Defense, and Congress in a
wide range of antitrust and regulatory matters, from the largest
mergers and acquisitions to price fixing and novel predation and
vertical restraints cases. He has represented clients in numerous
industries ranging from airlines and computer reservations systems to
telecommunications, defense contracting, consumer electronics, music,
financial services, credit cards, transportation, agriculture, health
care, soft drink concentrate, beer, aluminum can sheet and software.
Some of his work includes representing:
Rockstar, a consortium including Microsoft, Eriksson, RIM
and Sony, in its $4.5 billion acquisition of the patent
portfolio of Nortel Networks in a bankruptcy court approved
auction. Paul, Weiss is representing both Ericsson and the
consortium in seeking antitrust clearance in the U.S.;
Sharp Corporation in antitrust litigation and investigations
of cartel activity related to liquid crystal display units;
Ericsson in its acquisitions of the CDMA, GSM and Passport
businesses of Nortel Networks in several bankruptcy court
approved auctions for aggregate consideration in excess of $1.3
billion. The transactions required antitrust clearance in
numerous jurisdictions including U.S., Europe and China;
Mastercard Inc. in antitrust class actions in federal court
in New York involving all merchants in the United States that
accept Master, alleging that the fees merchants pay when
consumers use credit and debit cards are fixed illegally under
antitrust laws; and
The Lightsome Group ong antitrust issues in connection with
the disposition of its portfolio company, Prime Outlets
Acquisition Company, to Simon Property Group, Inc. in a
transaction valued at approximately $2.3 billion, which was
subject to an Ff investigation.
Along with a former chief economist of the Department of Justice
Antitrust Division, Joe developed ``Critical Loss Analysis,'' a
technique for market definition that has been adopted and used widely
by the Antitrust Division, the FTC, and the U.S. Court of Appeals. It
was incorporated into the DOJ/FTC Merger Guidelines. Critical Loss
Analysis also plays a fundamental role in evaluating the competitive
effects of transactions as well. Joe was also the first practicing
attorney to evaluate monopolization and vertical restraints under the
theory of ``Raising Rivals Costs'' and contributed to the development
of the theory, which now plays a significant role in the analysis of
such cases at both Federal antitrust enforcement agencies.
Joe's history with the FTC's Bureau of Competition started in the late
1980s when he served as the Associate Director for Mergers and the
Assistant Director for Evaluation, respectively. In the former
position, he was responsible for supervising numerous merger
investigations, and as head of the Evaluation Office, he was
responsible for analysis of all of the Competition Bureau's non-merger
matters.
While in private practice in 2000, Joe was nominated by the Department
of Justice, and approved by the Federal Communications Commission and
Federal District Court, as trustee of four wireless telephone
businesses relating to the GTE/Bell Atlantic/Vodafone transaction. In
that capacity, he became the holder of the FCC licenses to these
properties, making him the 10th largest wireless carrier in the United
States, and he was responsible for managing and divesting these
businesses valued at over $2 billion. He performed a similar function
for the Cingular/AT&T Wireless transaction.
Joe has published a wide range of articles on antitrust-related topics,
including two papers appearing in refereed economics journals, one of
which was selected for The Journal of Reprints for Antitrust Law and
Economics. He co-authored an article published in Oxford's Journal of
Competition Law & Economics titled ``The 2010 Merger Guidelines,
Critical Loss, and Linear Demand.'' Most recently, he co-authored ``In
Defense of Market Definition,'' published in the Winter 2012 issue of
The Antitrust Bulletin, a special issue with articles written in
response to Professor Louis Kaplow's Harvard Law Review article ``Why
(Ever) Define Markets?''
Joe continues to be recognized as a leading antitrust lawyer by
Chambers USA, Chambers Global and The Legal 500. For the past three
years, he has also been acknowledged by his peers for inclusion in The
Best Lawyers in America. Joe was selected to ``The International Who's
Who of Competition Lawyers & Economists 2013'' by the Global
Competition Review. Earlier in his career, he was selected to Crain's
New York Business ``40 Under 40,'' which recognizes 40 rising stars in
the New York business community.

Christian S. White
Designated Agency Ethics Official
Federal Trade Commission
Washington, DC.
Dear Mr. White:
The purpose of this letter is to describe the steps that I will
take to avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest in the event
that I am confirmed for the position of Commissioner of the Federal
Trade Commission.
As required by 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208(a), I will not participate
personally and substantially in any particular matter in which I know
that I have a financial interest directly an4 predictably affected by
the matter, or in which I know that a person whose interests are
imputed to me has a financial interest directly and predictably
affected by the matter, unless I first obtain a written waiver,
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208(b)(1), or qualify for a regulatory
exemption, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208(b)(2). I understand that the
interests of the following persons are imputed to me: any spouse or
minor child of mine; any general partner of a partnership in which I am
a limited or general partner; any organization in which I serve as
officer, director, trustee, general partner or employee; and any person
or organization with which I am negotiating or have an arrangement
concerning prospective employment.
I have resigned from my position with the law firm of Paul, Weiss,
Ritkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP. Pursuant to the firm's customary
partnership agreement, I am entitled to receive my final partnership
share distribution as a single, lump sum payment. I have received a
single, lump sum payment of my capital account on January 12, 2018. My
partnership share distribution will be calculated as of the date of my
resignation and will be received prior to assuming the duties of my
Federal position. For a period of one year after my resignation, I also
will not participate personally and substantially in any particular
matter involving specific parties in which I know Paul, Weiss, Ritkind,
Wharton & Garrison LLP, is a party or represents a party, unless I am
first authorized to participate, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2635.502(d).
In addition, I will not participate personally and substantially in any
particular matter involving specific parties in which I know a former
client of mine is a party or represents a party, for a period of one
year after I last provided service to that client, unless I am first
authorized to participate, pursuant to 5 C.F.R. Sec.
2635.502(d).
Finally, I understand that my obligation to comply with ethics laws
and regulations is ongoing and will require vigilance regarding any
changes in my financial interests, the financial interests of persons
and organizations imputed to me under the ethics laws and regulations,
and other outside interests.
I have disclosed in my financial disclosure report my financial
interest in Handy Place IV LLP. However, a preexisting confidentiality
agreement barred me from identifying the underlying assets of this fund
in my financial disclosure report. Therefore, I wil1 divest my
financial interest in this fund as soon as possible after confirmation
and not later than 90 days after my confirmation. Until I have divested
Handy Place IV LLP, I will not participate personally and substantially
in any particular matter that to my knowledge has a direct and
predictable effect on the financial interests of that fund or its
underlying assets, unless I first obtain a written waiver, pursuant to
18 U.S.C. Sec. 208(b)(1), or qualify for a regulatory exemption,
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208(b)(2). I understand that I may be
eligible to request a Certificate of Divestiture for qualifying assets
and that a Certificate of Divestiture is effective only if obtained
prior to divestiture. Regardless of whether I receive a Certificate of
Divestiture, I will ensure that all divestitures discussed in this
agreement occur within the agreed upon timeframe and that all proceeds
are invested in non-conflicting assets.
My spouse is an independent contractor for Maharishi Foundation
USA, Inc and she receives a commission tied to her personal services.
For as long as my spouse continues to serve Maharishi Foundation USA,
Inc. as an independent contractor, I will not participate personally
and substantially in any particular matter involving specific parties
in which I know Maharishi Foundation USA, Inc., is a party or
represents a party, unless I am first authorized to participate,
pursuant to 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2635.S02(d).
If I rely on a de minimis exemption under 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2640.202
with regard to any of my financial interests in securities, I will
monitor the value of those interests. If the aggregate value of
interests affected by a particular matter increases and exceeds the de
minimis threshold, I will not participate personally and substantially
in the particular matter that to my knowledge has a direct and
predictable effect on the interests, unless I first obtain a written
waiver pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Sec. 208(b)(1).
If I have a managed account or otherwise use the services of an
investment professional during my appointment, I will ensure that the
account manager or investment professional obtains my prior approval on
a case-by-case basis for the purchase of any assets other than cash,
cash equivalents, investment funds that qualify for the exemption at 5
C.F.R. Sec. 2640.201(a), obligations of the United States, or municipal
bonds.
I will meet in person with you during the first week of my service
in the position of Commissioner to complete the initial ethics briefing
required under 5 C.F.R. Sec. 2638.305. Within 90 days of my
confirmation, I will document my compliance with this ethics agreement
by notifying you in writing when I have completed the steps described
in this ethics agreement.
I understand that as an appointee I will be required to sign the
Ethics Pledge (Exec. Order No. 13770) and that I will be bound by the
requirements and restrictions therein in addition to the commitments I
have made in this ethics agreement.
I have been advised that this ethics agreement will be posted
publicly, consistent with 5 U.S.C. Sec. 552, on the website of the U.S.
Office of Government Ethics with ethics agreements of other
Presidential nominees who file public financial disclosure reports.
Finally, I understand that my obligation to comply with ethics laws
and regulations is ongoing and will require vigilance regarding any
changes in my financial interests, the financial interests of persons
and organizations imputed to me under the ethics laws and regulations,
and other outside interests.
Sincerely,
Joseph J. Simons.
The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Simons.
Ms. Wilson.
STATEMENT OF CHRISTINE S. WILSON, NOMINEE TO BE A COMMISSIONER,
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
Ms. Wilson. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Blumenthal,
Senator Capito, distinguished members of the Committee, I am
deeply honored to have been nominated by President Trump to
serve as a Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. Thank
you for the time that you and your staffs spent with us during
the last couple of weeks, and for inviting us here today.
And thank you also, Senator Capito, for your words of
confidence, which I appreciate.
I am joined here today by my husband, Ramsey Wilson; my
daughters, Regan and Savannah Wilson; my niece, MicKayla Smith;
and my in-laws, Kate and Tom Mason; as well as a number of very
close friends. I would echo what Joe said: without their love
and support, I would not be here today.
If confirmed, serving as Commissioner will be my third job
at the FTC. I first spent time there while I was in law school
as a law clerk in the agency's Bureau of Competition. I
returned as Chief of Staff to Chairman Tim Muris under
President George W. Bush. These roles helped me understand the
pride that FTC personnel rightly take in their agency and in
their mission. With fewer than 1,200 employees, the FTC
routinely tackles issues of daily importance to Americans in
every walk of life. Deploying its finite resources to maximum
advantage, the FTC promotes the interests of consumers by
ensuring the effective operation of markets, typically in a
bipartisan way. But the agency must be careful to wield its
power appropriately. To use a sports analogy coined by then-
Chairman Muris, the FTC must avoid trading its role as referee
of our markets for one as a manager of, or a star player in,
those markets.
As it enters its second century, the FTC has much important
work ahead of it to continue protecting consumers, including
preserving competition in health care markets; staying abreast
of technological advances and tailoring the FTC's advocacy and
enforcement efforts accordingly; and promoting the sound
economic analysis of competition and consumer protection
issues, both domestically and abroad.
Each of us, if confirmed, will bring his or her experiences
to the role of Commissioner. The most notable experience for me
occurred in 1984. Ronald Reagan was our President, I was in
high school, and I took a three-week trip behind the Iron
Curtain. I saw firsthand the long lines, empty shelves, and
misery inflicted by an authoritarian government and a command-
and-control economy. I finished that trip an ardent advocate
for personal liberty and market economies. And, yes, my older
daughter is named after President Reagan.
That trip through Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union was
the first in a series of events that led me here today. Other
key milestones are attributable to distinguished mentors with
whom I have been blessed: University of Florida Professor Roger
Blair, who taught my first antitrust law and economics class
and who showed me the possibility of a career in this field;
Professor Steve Salop, an antitrust economist for whom I worked
as a research assistant while at Georgetown Law; Jim Rill, the
former DOJ Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust, for whom I
worked after graduating from law school and who is here with us
today; and Tim Muris, for whom I served as Chief of Staff. Each
of them was instrumental in enhancing my understanding of
antitrust and consumer protection law and policy, and I am
deeply indebted to them.
Thank you for considering my nomination. I look forward to
answering your questions.

Wilson follow:]
Prepared Statement of Christine S. Wilson, Nominee for Commissioner,
Federal Trade Commission
Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Nelson, members of the Committee, I am
deeply honored to have been nominated by President Trump to serve as a
Commissioner of the Federal Trade Commission. Thank you for the time
that you and your staff have spent meeting with me, and for inviting
the four FTC nominees to appear here today.
I am joined by my husband, Ramsey Wilson; my daughters, Regan
Wilson and Savannah Wilson; my niece, MicKayla Smith; and my in-laws,
Tom and Kate Mason.
If confirmed, serving as Commissioner will be my third job at the

must be careful to wield its power appropriately. To use a sports

Each of us, if confirmed, will bring his or her experiences and
perspectives to the role of Commissioner. One of the most notable
experiences for me occurred in 1984. Ronald Reagan was our President, I
was in high school, and I took what would become a formative trip
behind the Iron Curtain. During this three-week trip, I saw first-hand
the long lines, empty shelves, and misery inflicted by an authoritarian
government and a command and control economy. I finished that trip an
ardent advocate for personal liberty and market economies.

As a high school student in 1984, I traveled through several
countries behind the Iron Curtain. During that trip, I witnessed first-
hand the consequences of an authoritarian government and a centrally
planned economy, and finished that trip an ardent advocate for a market
economy and personal liberty.
The foundation for my career as an antitrust lawyer was laid in
undergraduate school, when I took a graduate level class on antitrust
law and economics taught by Prof. Roger Blair. That class taught me how
I could help promote competitive markets in the U.S. At Georgetown
University Law Center, I worked as a research assistant for Prof.
Steven Salop, an antitrust economist. I also got my first FTC job
during law school. Upon graduation in 1995, I began practicing with
James F. Rill, former AAG for the Antitrust Division under George H.W.
Bush. And in 2001, I returned to the FTC as Chief of Staff to Chairman
Timothy J. Muris.
These distinguished mentors taught me a great deal about domestic
and international antitrust law and policy, antitrust economics, and
consumer protection. They also instilled in me the benefits of public
service. The most important experience of my professional career to
date was serving as Chief of Staff to FTC Chairman Muris. Each night, I
headed home from work knowing that I was making a difference for
American consumers by promoting the basic rules that help a market
economy work to the benefit of consumers.
I seek to return to public service to ensure the sound application
of the antitrust and consumer protection laws to the benefit of
consumers, and to capitalize on the ability of the FTC to advocate for
sensible market-based approaches both in the U.S. and abroad.
19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to
ensure that the department/agency has proper management and accounting
controls, and what experience do you have in managing a large
organization?
If confirmed, I would work diligently with my fellow Commissioners
to ensure that the Federal Trade Commission has proper management and
accounting controls. I would bring to bear my experience as Chief of
Staff to Chairman Timothy J. Muris, my experience in helping to manage
the antitrust practice groups at Kirkland & Ellis and O'Melveny &
Myers, and my experience overseeing the regulatory and international
groups and participating in the management of the law department at
Delta Air Lines.
20. What do you believe to be the top three challenges facing the
department/agency, and why?
Health care expenditures as a percentage of GDP have been
growing for several decades, and accounted for 17.9 percent of
GDP in 2017. Given the importance of this sector to ordinary
Americans, the FTC has long devoted significant attention to
this arena. Both the FTC's Bureau of Competition and its Bureau
of Consumer Protection have played a key role in promoting
vibrant competition, ensuring accurate information about
products and services, protecting consumers' sensitive medical
information, and advising government entities on the likely
impact of new regulations on entry and competition. The past
decade has seen significant regulatory and technological
changes that impact health care, as well as notable innovations
in how health care is delivered to patients. The continuing
growth of this sector, combined with significant concerns about
health care costs, misuse of sensitive data, and burgeoning
occupational licensing requirements, underscore the need for
the FTC to maintain its focus on this industry. It is
imperative for the FTC to continue increasing its understanding
of how these developments affect patient choice and the quality
of patient care, and how these changes should be incorporated
into the Commission's advocacy and enforcement efforts.
Trade across borders and the rapid proliferation of
competition and consumer protection regimes generate benefits
for consumers and businesses, but also give rise to potential
pitfalls. Consumers can easily fall prey to fraudsters who have
never set foot on U.S. soil, and foreign cartels can raise the
prices of goods imported into the U.S. American businesses can
face exclusionary conduct from foreign competitors that limits
access to markets overseas, and foreign governments can apply
their competition laws in ways that disproportionately
disadvantage U.S. companies. The FTC, together with the DOJ
Antitrust Division, has long played a role in coordinating with
and providing technical assistance to competition and consumer
protection agencies in other jurisdictions. But challenges
remain, and now more than ever the FTC and the DOJ Antitrust
Division must assume a global leadership role in advancing
sensible antitrust and consumer protection policies that
promote competition, protect consumers, and move away from the
use of competition and consumer protection regimes to favor
national champions and advance industrial policy goals.
Advances in technology create many benefits for consumers
but present enforcement complexities for the FTC. Some of the
most controversial public policy issues--e.g., the intersection
of intellectual property and antitrust, data security and
privacy--are rooted in continuing technological advances. An
informed understanding of how technologies work and how their
use affects consumers is therefore necessary to the sensible
and economically grounded exercise of the FTC's authority. The
FTC historically has taken advantage of its unique R&D
capabilities--including 6(b) studies, hearings, and workshops--
to stay abreast of technological developments that may
implicate new enforcement priorities and challenges, to fashion
sound enforcement policies, and to make policy recommendations
to Congress, as well as to Federal and state agencies. The FTC
is well positioned to be a thought leader on the complex issues
that arise in this arena, and should continue taking full
advantage of that capability.
b. potential conflicts of interest
1. Describe all financial arrangements, deferred compensation
agreements, and other continuing dealings with business associates,
clients, or customers. Please include information related to retirement

c.
Delta Air Lines unvested stock options: I received unvested stock
options under the 2017 Long Term Incentive Plan. Under the

remains unvested.

appointment, I will not exercise my entitlement to these Delta

calculate the travel I took from November 1, 2017 to January
31, 2018 and impute the income into my W2 and pay my income
taxes up to the maximum of my tax allowance. For travel after
January 31, 2018, Delta will impute the income but not pay my
income taxes.

Next up, Mr. Phillips. And it will be the Senate's loss and
the FTC's gain, but welcome. Please proceed.
STATEMENT OF NOAH JOSHUA PHILLIPS, NOMINEE TO BE A
COMMISSIONER, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
Mr. Phillips. Thank you. Chairman Thune, Ranking Member
Blumenthal, members of the Committee, I want to thank you for
holding this hearing and for the opportunity to testify before
you today. This is a critical time for the Federal Trade
Commission, and your stewardship of that agency is essential.
I also want to thank the President for the honor that he
has bestowed and the confidence that he has placed in me. I am
deeply humbled by that.
I would like to thank Senator Cornyn. It has been the honor
of my life to spend the last 6 years working for him.
With the Committee's permission, I will reintroduce my
family, and I thank you in advance for your patience with some
of them. First, my father, David Phillips, is a law professor
at Northeastern University in Boston. I did not go there, but
he taught me everything. What is perhaps more important, I was
10 years old when my mother died of cancer, and my father
raised me and my two sisters all by himself. I know that my
mother, Deborah Kaplan Phillips, is here with us today in
spirit.
My younger sister, Judith, is here. She and her family live
in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and she works as an attorney at a
startup devoted to improving patient care.
My older sister, Aliza, is not able to be here. She is a
clinical psychologist and instructor at Harvard Medical School,
and has three great kids of her own. I'm thrilled to have her
husband, Ira, a journalist and author, here with me today.
Here with me are my three children: Dalia, Jonah, and our
baby, Abigail. I could go on about them indefinitely, but for
present purposes, I will say that Dalia is beginning to learn
the game Monopoly, and that Jonah shares this Committee's
interest in airplanes and trains.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Phillips. Finally, my wife and love, Sarah, is here
with me. She is a committed public servant, recently off a
four-year detail to the White House on the staff of the
National Security Council. Between her work in government and
out, it is no exaggeration to say that Sarah is personally
responsible for saving tens of thousands of lives. I am in awe
as well as love. Happy Valentine's Day.
Members of the Committee, the FTC is an important
institution at a critical time for our national economy.
Congress has tasked the Commission with enforcing consumer
protection laws and antitrust laws, which, in turn, help
consumers by protecting competition. The free market is the
most powerful and effective engine of social progress in human
history, but it works better with rules of the road and cops to
enforce them. The FTC is one of those cops. Its mission
statement reads, ``Working to protect consumers by preventing
anticompetitive, deceptive, and unfair business practices,
enhancing informed consumer choice, and public understanding of
the competitive process, and accomplishing this without unduly
burdening legitimate business activity.''
I believe in that mission. By following it, the FTC not
only protects consumers, it helps instill confidence in
markets, foster innovation, and create jobs, and that is no
small task. First, the FTC must execute the authority vested in
it by Congress to protect consumers and competition. Second,
the FTC must maintain predictability and intellectual rigor. We
need sound rules on which consumers and businesses both can
rely. Third, the FTC must keep abreast of developments in
technology and business. And the agency must do all of this as
Americans are hearing more about antitrust, seeing high health
care costs, and sharing their data for use in new and different
ways. I am here before you because, if confirmed, I want to
help lead the FTC at this critical time.
Over my career, I have worked on issues the FTC deals with
from different perspectives: as a mergers and acquisitions
analyst; as a lawyer litigating antitrust, fraud, and other
cases, and doing merger review; and for the bulk of my legal
career, here in the U.S. Senate. And that last perspective is
key.
As the members of this Committee well know, legislation is
hard. It requires understanding complex problems, listening to
a broad array of stakeholders, judgment, and finding common
bipartisan ground. For over 6 years, I have worked hard and
well with Democrats and Republicans, and, if confirmed, I will
continue that at the FTC.
Working here in the Senate also has given me a personal
appreciation for the Constitution's separation of powers,
including the primacy of Congress in fashioning national
policy. I know what goes into the words you write, and, if
confirmed, I will take care faithfully to execute them.
I thank the members of this Committee. And I look forward
to your questions.

17. Please identify each instance in which you have testified
orally or in writing before Congress in a governmental or non-

testimony. None.
18. Given the current mission, major programs, and major
operational objectives of the department/agency to which you have been
nominated, what in your background or employment experience do you
believe affirmatively qualifies you for appointment to the position for
which you have been nominated, and why do you wish to serve in that
position?
Several aspects of my professional background qualify me for
appointment to the FTC. As Chief Counsel and, earlier, Counsel to
Senator Cornyn, I have advised him on a number of subject matters that
fall within the FTC's jurisdiction, notably antitrust, consumer
protection, fraud, intellectual property and privacy. I have also
advised him on oversight of both the agency and the Department of
Justice's Antitrust Division, when those issues have come before the
Senate Judiciary Committee. As an attorney in private practice, I
worked on those areas (including merger review), as well as on other
litigation issues related to mergers and acquisitions. My career began
in mergers and acquisitions, advising firms on transactions in the
energy industry.
The FTC's antitrust, consumer protection and public education
missions are as important to the American economy as ever. Technology
and business practices are evolving rapidly, public discussion about
antitrust is growing louder and Americans are grappling with increasing
healthcare costs and new realities of data privacy. I want to help lead
the FTC to face these challenges in order to protect American
consumers. My nearly two decades of experience--in public and private
service, as an adviser to policy makers and businesses alike--will
enable me to do so.
19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to
ensure that the department/agency proper management and accounting
controls, and what experience do you have in managing a large
organization?
Management of the FTC is vested principally in the Chairman. As
Commissioner, I would work with the Chairman, the other Commissioners
and agency senior staff to ensure proper management and accounting
controls. I have never run a large organization. As a Commissioner, I
would leverage the managerial experience I gained in my professional
career as a lawyer in private practice, a congressional staffer, and a
non-profit board member.
20. What do you believe to be the top three challenges facing the
department/agency, and why?
In my view, the agency's top three challenges are: (i) protecting
the American consumer by enforcing the antitrust and consumer
protection laws written by Congress; (ii) maintaining predictability
and intellectual rigor in the interpretation and enforcement of those
laws; and (iii) keeping abreast of developments in technology and
business practices to ensure the protection of American consumers.
b. potential conflicts of interest
1. Describe all financial arrangements, deferred compensation
agreements, and other continuing dealings with business associates,
clients, or customers. Please include information related to retirement
accounts.
I have none.
2. Do you have any commitments or agreements, formal or informal,
to maintain employment, affiliation, or practice with any business,
association or other organization during your appointment? If so,
please explain. No.
3. Indicate any investments, obligations, liabilities, or other
relationships which could involve potential conflicts of interest in
the position to which you have been nominated.
In connection with the nomination process, I have consulted with
the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and the Federal Trade Commission's
Designated Agency Ethics Official to identify potential conflicts of
interest. If confirmed, any potential conflicts of interest will be
resolved in accordance with the terms of the ethics agreement that I
have entered into with the Commission's Designated Agency Ethics
Official. I am not aware of any other potential conflicts of interest.
4. Describe any business relationship, dealing, or financial
transaction which you have had during the last ten years, whether for
yourself, on behalf of a client, or acting as an agent, that could in
any way constitute or result in a possible conflict of interest in the
position to which you have been nominated.
In connection with the nomination process, I have consulted with
the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and the Federal Trade Commission's
Designated Agency Ethics Official to identify potential conflicts of
interest. If confirmed, any potential conflicts of interest will be
resolved in accordance with the terms of the ethics agreement that I
have entered into with the Commission's Designated Agency Ethics
Official. I am not aware of any other potential conflicts of interest.
5. Describe any activity during the past ten years in which you
have been engaged for the purpose of directly or indirectly influencing
the passage, defeat, or modification of any legislation or affecting
the administration and execution of law or public policy.
None, other than my work as a congressional staffer.
6. Explain how you will resolve any potential conflict of interest,
including any that may be disclosed by your responses to the above
items.
In connection with the nomination process, I have consulted with
the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and the Federal Trade Commission's
Designated Agency Ethics Official to identify potential conflicts of

professional group? No.
2. Have you ever been investigated, arrested, charged, or held by
any Federal; State, or other law enforcement authority of any Federal,
State, county, or municipal entity, other than for a minor traffic
offense? If so, please explain.
Yes. In 1997, my sophomore year in college, my roommates and I
threw a party at which alcohol was served. My roommates and I were not
yet 21, and the Hanover Police Department (HPD) shut down the party
following a complaint. I was arrested for the unlawful possession of
alcohol. The charges were dropped following my participation in the
HPD's Alcohol Diversion Program.

STATEMENT OF ROHIT CHOPRA, NOMINEE TO BE A COMMISSIONER,
FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION
Mr. Chopra. Thank you, Chairman Thune and Ranking Member
Blumenthal and members of the Committee. I appreciate the
opportunity to be here today.
It's an honor to be nominated by the President to the
Federal Trade Commission, an agency with one of the most
respected staffs in the world. And I'm grateful to my family,
friends, teachers, and colleagues for their support, some of
whom are here today.
This is my fifth time testifying in hearings before Members
at the U.S. Senate. I believe in the fundamental importance of
congressional oversight over Federal agencies to ensure that
they're working for the greater good and using public resources
efficiently. And I am committed to being responsive and
accountable to this Committee and this chamber.
The FTC is more than a century old, but many of its
traditions should remain timeless. The agency has a
longstanding history of Commissioners working on a bipartisan
basis to protect consumers and competition by fairly enforcing
the law. And it has been a privilege for me to get to know Noah
Phillips, Christine Wilson, and Joe Simons.
The agency also knows that law enforcement proceedings
should not be the only tool in the toolbox. Research, consumer
and business education, and cooperation with other agencies can
be powerful tools, and I'm eager to continue these traditions
along with my fellow Commissioners for the benefit of consumers
and businesses alike.
At the same time, the FTC faces significant challenges in
today's day and age. The massive data breaches at Equifax and
other companies highlight the serious issues we face with the
security and proliferation of consumer data in our economy and
society. Consumers, including senior citizens and military
families, continue to be targeted by scammers and fraudsters.
And record-high equity market valuations, the outlook for
global growth, and the shape of the yield curve suggest to me
that sizable M&A activity will occur in 2018 and perhaps
beyond. At the same time, small business starts are hovering
near a 40-year low. All of these trends will require careful
attention of the Commission.
In the private sector, I've seen how both large and small
enterprises seek to serve consumers while responding to the
demands and pressures of a competitive environment for capital,
labor, and other input markets. In my previous service in
government, I was proud to lead and contribute to work that
benefited both consumers and honest businesses, shutting down
debt relief scams, securing hundreds of millions of dollars in
refunds for borrowers harmed by illegal practices, and
promoting greater competition in the student loan refinance
market.
If confirmed, I look forward to working cooperatively with
my fellow Commissioners, the staff, this Committee, and the
public at large to advance the agency's mission to protect
consumers and competition with openness, transparency, and
humility.
Thank you. And I look forward to your questions.
[The prepared statement and biographical information of Mr.
Chopra follow:]
Prepared Statement of Rohit Chopra, Nominee to be a Commissioner,
Federal Trade Commission
Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and Members of the
Committee, thank you for holding this hearing today to consider Joseph
Simons, Christine Wilson, Noah Phillips, and me to serve as
Commissioners of the Federal Trade Commission.
It has been a great honor to be nominated by the President to a
position that plays such a critical role in promoting an economic
environment that works for hardworking and honest businesses and
consumers. I am indebted to my family, friends, teachers, and
colleagues who have led me to sit before you today, as well as to many
current and former Commissioners who have provided valuable advice.
This is my fifth time testifying in hearings before Members of the
United States Senate, the majority of these taking place during my
previous government service. I deeply believe in the fundamental
importance of Congressional oversight over Federal agencies to ensure
that they are working in the interest of taxpayers and the public, and
I committed to being responsive and accountable to this Committee.
The Federal Trade Commission is among the most highly-respected
agencies in the Federal Government. Not only does the agency have a
strong tradition of bipartisanship, but it also does not limit its work
to adversarial law enforcement proceedings. Using research, consumer
and business education, and cooperation with other agencies, I am eager
to continue this tradition for the benefit of consumers and businesses
alike.
At the same time, the Federal Trade Commission faces significant
challenges. Consumers, including senior citizens and military families,
continue to be targeted by scammers and fraudsters, especially online.
The massive data breach at Equifax highlighted the serious issues we
face with the security of the proliferation of consumer data in our
economy and society. Record-high equity market valuations, the outlook
for global growth, and the shape of the yield curve suggest sizable M&A
activity in 2018, and perhaps beyond. All of these trends will require
resources and careful attention of the Commission, underscoring the
importance of responsible stewardship of the agency's finite resources.
I hope my experience in the private sector working with both large
and small enterprises on how to serve consumers while responding to the
demands and pressures of a competitive capital markets environment,
coupled with my experience as a government official, will prove to be
an asset to the Federal Trade Commission and its mission.
During my tenure at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and
the U.S. Department of Education, I was proud to lead and contribute to
work that created significant benefits for consumers and legitimate
businesses alike. Working with a bipartisan group of Attorneys General,
my colleagues and I worked to shut down a deceptive website
masquerading as an official government entity that targeted student
veterans. I led efforts to obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in
refunds for consumers harmed by illegally-originated student loans and
improper debt collection tactics.
But importantly, I know that agencies can achieve benefits for the
market outside of formal enforcement proceedings through research and
engagement with industry and the public. I've worked with industry
innovators to remove perceived regulatory barriers in private-sector
loan refinancing, helping to contribute to a robust market that is
creating competition and cutting interest rates for consumers across
the country. I helped develop a new Financial Aid Shopping Sheet that
has been voluntarily adopted by thousands of colleges across the
country to better educate students and their families on how to make
better decisions on financing their higher education. I co-authored a
report uncovering harmful practices that led to the overcharging of
tens of thousands of military families--practices which have largely
ceased to exist.
If confirmed, I look forward to working cooperatively with my
fellow Commissioners, the Commission's staff, this Committee, and the
public to advance the agency's mission to protect consumers and
competition with openness, transparency, and humility.
Thank you for your consideration.

18. Given the current mission, major programs, and major
operational objectives of the department/agency to which you have been
nominated, what in your background or employment experience do you
believe affirmatively qualifies you for appointment to the position for
which you have been nominated, and why do you wish to serve in that
position?
I am a deep believer in markets. When markets function well, they
can deliver prosperity for families and enterprises in our country. But
when a market participant engages in unfair or deceptive conduct,
markets cannot function appropriately. Transparent, even-handed
enforcement doesn't only serve the interests of consumers, it also
helps honest businesses grow and succeed.
My work in the public sector as a Federal financial regulator, in
the private sector working with companies to develop and execute new
business strategies, and in the nonprofit sector working with a broad
range of stakeholders on public policy issues has allowed me to analyze
complex problems from multiple vantage points.
Should I be confirmed, I hope to steward the agency with my fellow
Commissioners in a way that contributes to healthy and dynamic markets
that are fair and competitive.
19. What do you believe are your responsibilities, if confirmed, to
ensure that the department/agency has proper management and accounting
controls, and what experience do you have in managing a large
organization?
The Commission is charged with setting agency priorities and
carefully stewarding taxpayer resources in an effective and efficient
manner. I believe that careful oversight of agency activities,
particularly with respect to management and accounting controls, are
critical.
My previous role as a senior government executive, as well as my
private sector experiences with large enterprises, have equipped me
with the skills to cooperate with and scrutinize the outputs of audits
conducted by Inspectors General, the Government Accountability Office,
and independent audit firms, in order to ensure that appropriate
corrective actions are taken.
20. What do you believe to be the top three challenges facing the
department/agency, and why?
First, the Commission must confront the rapid development and use
of big data in today's modern economy. Output of data is doubling
almost every two years. I have closely observed how big data is
reshaping the financial services and education industries, but they are
certainly not exceptions. Big data is offering new opportunities in
almost every sector of the economy. At the same time, it raises
important questions with respect to consumer protection, privacy, and
competition that require thoughtful examination.
Second, while the Commission is more than a century old, it must be
nimble and adjust to macroeconomic shifts both here and abroad. For
example, in the near term, strong corporate earnings and balance sheets
suggest that M&A activity is likely to be robust, despite expectations
of rising interest rates. The macroeconomic environment has significant
implications for the type of work the Commission can expect to address
in the upcoming years. The Commission must ensure that it has a clear
view into the broader economic environment.
Third, I believe that all government agencies can and should
continuously identify opportunities to make better use of taxpayer
resources. Despite the significant responsibilities Congress has
charged the Commission with executing, agency resources are, of course,
limited. Stewarding the agency to meet its obligations to the public
with these limited resources requires attention and care.
b. potential conflicts of interest
1. Describe all financial arrangements, deferred compensation
agreements, and other continuing dealings with business associates,
clients, or customers. Please include information related to retirement
accounts.
If confirmed, I will resign from all outside positions.
2. Do you have any commitments or agreements, formal or informal,
to maintain employment, affiliation, or practice with any business,
association or other organization during your appointment? If so,
please explain. No.
3. Indicate any investments, obligations, liabilities, or other
relationships which could involve potential conflicts of interest in
the position to which you have been nominated.
In connection with the nomination process, I have consulted with
the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and the Federal Trade Commission's
Designated Agency Ethics Official to identify potential conflicts of
interest. If confirmed, any potential conflicts of interest will be
resolved in accordance with the terms of the ethics agreement that I
have entered into with the Commission's Designated Agency Ethics
Official. I am not aware of any other potential conflicts of interest.
4. Describe any business relationship, dealing, or financial
transaction which you have had during the last ten years, whether for
yourself, on behalf of a client, or acting as an agent, that could in
any way constitute or result in a possible conflict of interest in the
position to which you have been nominated.
In connection with the nomination process, I have consulted with
the U.S. Office of Government Ethics and the Federal Trade Commission's
Designated Agency Ethics Official to identify potential conflicts of
interest. If confirmed, any potential conflicts of interest will be
resolved in accordance with the terms of the ethics agreement that I
have entered into with the Commission's Designated Agency Ethics
Official. I am not aware of any other potential conflicts of interest.
5. Describe any activity during the past ten years in which you
have been engaged for the purpose of directly or indirectly influencing
the passage, defeat, or modification of any legislation or affecting
the administration and execution of law or public policy.
As a Federal Government official at the U.S. Department of
Education and Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, I was frequently
solicited by Members of Congress and their staffs to provide
substantive and technical advice on potential legislation. Outside of
government, I have been called upon to express my views on consumer
protection and higher education issues, though at no time have I ever
served as a registered lobbyist.
6. Explain how you will resolve any potential conflict of interest,
including any that may be disclosed by your responses to the above
items.
If confirmed, any potential conflicts of interest will be resolved
in accordance with the terms of the ethics agreement that I have
entered into with the Commission's Designated Agency Ethics Official. I
am not aware of any other potential conflicts of interest.
c. legal matters
1. Have you ever been disciplined or cited for a breach of ethics,
professional misconduct, or retaliation by, or been the subject of a
complaint to, any court, administrative agency, the Office of Special
Counsel, professional association, disciplinary committee, or other
professional group? If yes:
a.
Provide the name of agency, association, committee, or group;
b.
Provide the date the citation, disciplinary action, complaint, or
personnel action was issued or initiated;
c.
Describe the citation, disciplinary action, complaint, or
personnel action;
d.
Provide the results of the citation, disciplinary action,
complaint, or personnel action.
No.
2. Have you ever been investigated, arrested, charged, or held by
any Federal, State, or other law enforcement authority of any Federal,
State, county, or municipal entity, other than for a minor traffic
offense? If so, please explain. No.
3. Have you or any business or nonprofit of which you are or were
an officer ever been involved as a party in an administrative agency
proceeding, criminal proceeding, or civil litigation? If so, please
explain. No.
4. Have you ever been convicted (including pleas of guilty or nolo
contendere) of any criminal violation other than a minor traffic
offense? If so, please explain. No.
5. Have you ever been accused, formally or informally, of sexual
harassment or discrimination on the basis of sex, race, religion, or
any other basis? If so, please explain. No.
6. Please advise the Committee of any additional information,
favorable or unfavorable, which you feel should be disclosed in
connection with your nomination.
In November 2016, I was diagnosed with advanced thyroid cancer. I
am blessed to have support from family, friends, colleagues, and
neighbors, and I am grateful for the excellent medical care I receive.
My treatment is being supervised by Dr. Robert Tuttle of Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The treatment has included a
major surgical intervention (total thyroidectomy) and post-operative
iodine radiation treatment.
While I continue to undergo regular diagnostic monitoring and
consultations with my medical team, my condition has not stopped me
from leading a productive life. I have been assured by my medical team
that I will be able to fully execute my professional responsibilities,
if confirmed.
Should the Committee seek any additional information about my
course of treatment or my fitness to serve, I have authorized my
medical team to fully cooperate with these requests.
d. relationship with committee
1. Will you ensure that your department/agency complies with
deadlines for information set by congressional committees?
Yes. During my tenure as a Federal agency official, I have always
sought to work cooperatively with all appropriate committees of
jurisdiction to ensure that information requests from Majority and
Minority staff receive appropriate and timely responses, and I will
continue to do so.
2. Will you ensure that your department/agency does whatever it can
to protect congressional witnesses and whistle blowers from reprisal
for their testimony and disclosures? Yes.
3. Will you cooperate in providing the Committee with requested
witnesses, including technical experts and career employees, with
firsthand knowledge of matters of interest to the Committee?
Yes. I will work closely with Members of the Commission and senior
agency officials to ensure that the Committee is adequately briefed on
key issues from appropriate experts employed by the Commission.
4. Are you willing to appear and testify before any duly
constituted committee of the Congress on such occasions as you may be
reasonably requested to do so?
Yes. As a former Federal agency official, I have testified on
numerous occasions before congressional committees. While testimony can
be resource-intensive for agencies, hearings provide Congress, the
market, and the public with greater confidence that agency activities
are aligned with the public interest.

The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chopra.
Well, let's start by asking the basic question, and I'll
ask this of Mr. Simons, Ms. Wilson, Mr. Phillips, and Mr.
Chopra. I know each of you appreciates the importance of
cooperation between the FTC and Congress. Nevertheless, these
nomination hearings give us an opportunity to underscore that
point.
So the question is, If confirmed, will you pledge to work
collaboratively with this Committee and its members to provide
thorough and timely responses to our requests for information?
Mr. Simons. I would be thrilled to, Senator.
Ms. Wilson. Absolutely, Senator Thune.
Mr. Phillips. Absolutely, Senator.
Mr. Chopra. Yes, absolutely.
The Chairman. Thank you.
I'm going to direct this question to all four nominees, and
it's kind of a big question, but if you could perhaps maybe
summarize your views on this. But with the growth of search in
social media in recent years, I would like to get a response
from each of you regarding the state of competition in the
American technology sector. Some argue that big tech should be
subject to more antitrust scrutiny. The applicable law would
seem to require a more nuanced analysis, one that's not based
on size alone.
So could you just sort of fairly quickly describe your
views or your antitrust concerns with respect to large tech
firms, such as Facebook and Google?
And, Mr. Simons, we'll start with you.
Mr. Simons. Sure, happy to. So at a high level, I believe
that big is not necessarily bad. I also believe that big is not
necessarily good. Sometimes big is good, sometimes big is bad,
and sometime it's both at the same time. Oftentimes, companies
get big because they are successful with the consumer. They
offer a good service at a low price, and that's a good thing,
and we don't want to interfere with that. On the other hand,
companies that are already big and influential can sometimes
use inappropriate means, anticompetitive means, to get big or
to stay big, and if that's the case, then we should be
vigorously enforcing the antitrust laws and attacking that
conduct and prohibiting it. That's my overall approach,
Senator.
The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Simons.
Ms. Wilson.
Ms. Wilson. Thank you, Senator. I know there have been
questions about whether the antitrust laws, as currently
crafted, are sufficient to address these issues, I would like
to affirm my view today that in fact the antitrust laws, as
written, are broad and flexible and are capable of adapting to
evolving technology. So I have no concerns at this time about
our ability to address the issues that may arise under the
FTC's current jurisdiction. Obviously, if we find that there
are any gaps, we would come back to you and open a dialogue
about that.
In terms of whether there are issues, I understand that
there have been investigations into prominent technology
companies in the past, there has been a lapse of time, and
technology has evolved. And so it may make sense to take
another look at concerns that have been raised. My door is
open. I am interested in hearing concerns or complaints that
people may have about various companies. There is no company
that is above the law or beyond the reach of the law.
If confirmed, I would support Chairman Simons in taking a
look at potentially unlawful conduct and following the facts
where they lead.
The Chairman. Thank you.
Mr. Phillips.
Mr. Phillips. Thank you for the question, Senator. In a
sense, it is ``the'' big question. Like many Americans, I
experience daily the incredible impact that many of these firms
have on my life. I see the impact they have on the lives of
others, including even my little children. I think the FTC has
a very big role to play here in applying the law fairly and
applying it carefully, and, very importantly, in continuing to
keep abreast of changing trends in the markets, watching how
they develop, and seeing how our laws, both consumer protection
and antitrust, apply to them.
I don't know all the answers, but the two commitments that
I want to make to this Committee are, first, that if confirmed,
I will help keep the agency abreast of developments, working
with career staff and my colleagues here; and, second, if there
are violations of the law, no matter who is committing them,
that the FTC will enforce the law.
The Chairman. Thank you.
Mr. Chopra.
Mr. Chopra. Thank you. Yes, I want to just offer a few
observations. One is that, unlike most sectors of the economy,
large technology firms don't just compete with each other,
they're competing with several other market verticals and
sectors of the economy. They're competing with health care
companies. They're competing with retail. And so many other
major sectors. And this has been a real challenge for equity
and debt analysts seeking to predict how these industries will
evolve, and how profitability and market dynamics will occur.
And I think that it implores the Commission to make sure that
we have the adequate talent, analytical capabilities, and to
engage in constant learning.
I agree with Mr. Simons that there's a real role to
continue to look back at past actions to determine whether
models and empirical analysis have been accurate, how they can
be evolved, but I think it's an area that we need to be humble
and continue to learn to effectively understand dynamics in
this marketplace.
The Chairman. Thank you.
Mr. Simons and Mr. Chopra, the American Bar Association's
Antitrust Law Section issued a 60-page report in January 2017
on the state of antitrust enforcement. The Antitrust Section
makes a number of recommendations for improving the FTC's
handling of antitrust and consumer protection issues, such as
recommending that all consumer protection orders should sunset
in 5 years absent extenuating circumstances, such as fraud or
recidivism. Do you agree with this recommendation regarding a
5-year sunset for all orders? And if so, will you seek to
implement this reform should you be confirmed?
Mr. Simons. So first let me say that the ABA Antitrust
Section does a terrific job. They have a whole host of
extremely thoughtful people. And so anytime they make a
recommendation, you want to think about it seriously. And so
that's what I would commit to do. I don't have a conclusive
view yet. I would want to talk to the staff at the agency
before reaching any conclusions on that. And, of course, I
would want to talk to my fellow Commissioners.
The Chairman. Yes.
Mr. Chopra. Senator Thune, the report had a number of
recommendations, some of which Chair Ohlhausen has already
sought to implement, and that appears to be well received. I
would share that with respect to model orders, I think the
recommendation about revisiting some of those model orders with
respect to consent decrees that are filed in administrative
proceedings or in Federal court looking at whether those
lengths is appropriate. Twenty years, that is currently used, I
know is not common in all Federal agencies, so I think it's
worth always revisiting whether things can be changed or not.
But I would really want to consult with the experts and staff
at the Commission before making any final commitments.
The Chairman. Senator Blumenthal.
STATEMENT OF HON. RICHARD BLUMENTHAL,
U.S. SENATOR FROM CONNECTICUT
Senator Blumenthal. Thank you very much.
Welcome to all of you, and thank you for being here. Thank
you for your service. In particular, welcome to Mr. Phillips,
as a member of the Senate family, and thanks for your work on
the Senate Judiciary Committee, where I also serve.
I assume, by the way, that your request for patience was
for your father, the law professor, not for your children.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Phillips. Senator, I have long since learned to ask
others for patience with my father. I try not to ask others for
what I myself sometimes cannot give.
[Laughter.]
Senator Blumenthal. And I assume he's not teaching anyone
Monopoly.
[Laughter.]
Senator Blumenthal. Let me begin by saying that the FTC is
entering a new era. It has a storied and wonderful past, but
the simple stark fact is that consumers and competition have
never been more threatened as the means of delivering products
and making them, and the products themselves become more
complex and important, so do the challenges of protecting
competition and consumers from all of the schemes that now can
be used on the internet rather than snail mail and other means
of contacting and working the chains of delivery of products to
consumers.
So I think that the FTC needs to enter this new era with
new energy and new tools. And that's why I have introduced, for
example, laws that would protect against data breaches.
Mr. Simons, you and I have talked about the need for better
protection for consumers against data breaches. My hope is that
you will, and the other Commissioners will, support the
legislation that I have introduced. And I don't know whether
you've had a chance to consider further the Data Breach
Accountability and Enforcement Act of 2017. I hope that you've
thought more and perhaps you could support it. Do you have
another--any more opinions on it?
Mr. Simons. Sure, Senator. Thank you for the question. One
of things that I am extremely concerned about is whether the
FTC has sufficient authority to deal with data breaches,
particularly in terms of being able to create sufficient
deterrents, create an incentive for the companies to take care
of the consumer data as they should. And right now, we don't
have civil penalty authority, and I think that's something that
we should consider very carefully and take a very close look
at. So I'm very sympathetic to your bill, and I look forward
very much to working with you on it.
Senator Blumenthal. Would the other nominees agree with
that view?
Ms. Wilson. Yes, I would.
Mr. Phillips. Yes.
Senator Blumenthal. Sorry.
Mr. Chopra. Yes. If I could add, Senator, that data
breaches impose great deals of costs also for small
enterprises. The Equifax data breach has led to significant
losses for community banks, credit unions, other financial
institutions. So I think we need to think about the whole
picture, including harms that occur to consumers.
Senator Blumenthal. There are various areas where the FTC
in this new era needs reinvention, and that's one of them.
Another seems to me to be drug pricing and drug shortages.
Every Member of this body I think is in favor of making drug
prices more affordable to consumers. The President has talked
about it. And yet every other day seemingly there are reports
of a drug or device being marked up by 200 or 300 percent.
I am cosponsor of legislation titled, ``Improving Access to
Affordable Prescription Drugs Act,'' that directs the
Department of HHS and OIG and the FTC to work together to
create a task force that would try to reduce the cost of
prescription drugs. It is only a beginning. There needs to be
vigorous and strong enforcement of our antitrust laws against
the consolidation that has occurred in that industry as well as
others.
And with all due respect, Ms. Wilson, in the airline
industry as well. If we have time for a second round, I will be
asking you about that industry.
But let me focus now on drug pricing. Would you agree, Mr.
Simons, that we need more vigorous enforcement in this area?
Mr. Simons. Senator, I'm very concerned, as you just
described, with drug pricing. I think the pharma industry is a
critical industry for our economy and for the consumers. It
affects people who are in a very vulnerable point in their life
often. And so I'm very interested in dealing with that. As we
spoke when we met, I would like to explore putting together a
drug pricing monitoring task force so that we can see in real
time or as close to real time as possible what's going on with
drug pricing, act as quickly as possible, try to identify when
high pricing is caused by anticompetitive conduct so we can
investigate immediately, and engage in enforcement actions
quickly; if the price spikes are caused by something maybe that
is regulatory in nature, alert the FDA to that; and if it's
something else, then potentially maybe legislation would be
appropriate, and come talk to you about it.
Senator Blumenthal. Would you consider supporting the
measure that I mentioned just now?
Mr. Simons. I would certainly consider it.
Senator Blumenthal. Do any of the other nominees have views
on that topic?
Mr. Chopra. Well, I'll just add that I think the Commission
needs to anchor its work to where it can really focus on the
pocketbooks of consumers and activity in the economy. And given
that so many patients are an ever-increasing share of spend on
prescription drugs and health care, it must be a top priority
to enforce all the applicable laws.
Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Blumenthal.
Senator Schatz.
STATEMENT OF HON. BRIAN SCHATZ,
U.S. SENATOR FROM HAWAII
Senator Schatz. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you all for your willingness to serve. Thank you to
your families for supporting you in this endeavor. I want to
ask you a little bit more about the credit bureaus, the credit
reporting agencies. They operate basically in the dark. The FTC
has some analysis that indicates you have a high error rate.
It's difficult exactly to determine what the material error
rate is, but let's call it in the, you know, mid-low single
digits, which means that millions of Americans are unable to
obtain employment or a loan for a car or a house as a result of
an error and a customer relationship that is not in their
possession.
Although the credit bureaus call us their customers, their
customers are actually the people who are evaluating our
creditworthiness. We are not in possession of the data that is
being sorted, aggregated, and then sold, or rented in some
instances, by these companies. And the FTC has done some good
work here, just as the Congress has done some good work here.
But these credit bureaus operate almost entirely in the dark,
and it has real impact. This not just a consumer issue, this is
also a question of the ecosystem itself.
I'll preface my question with the following. I do not want
to blow up this ecosystem. We do need some way to evaluate the
creditworthiness of individuals. We don't want to go back to
the days when you had to walk in and present yourself to a
banker, who evaluated your creditworthiness sometimes on the
basis of a hunch or whether they knew you personally. So I
understand the need for these credit reporting agencies to
exist, but I think the FTC has to do more.
I'll start with Mr. Simons and go down the line as quickly
as possible, do you think the FTC has the authority to do more?
And are you inclined to explore those possibilities?
Mr. Simons. Well, Senator, I certainly share your concerns.
And that's something I definitely would want to look into, talk
to the staff at the FTC, and would be happy to work with you on
it.
Ms. Wilson. I, too, share your concerns, Senator. As you
know, the Federal Trade Commission does have enforcement
responsibility for a number of laws in this area, including the
Fair Credit Reporting Act and the FACT Act. Right before
Chairman Tim Muris arrived, there was a significant enforcement
action against the three credit rating agencies, and under
Chairman Muris, at least some of them were found to have
violated orders that would allow consumers easily to call in
and verify their credit records and then make changes if
necessary.
I would be very interested in talking with FTC staff to
find out whether they think there are areas where additional
authority would be useful. I would look forward to continuing
the dialogue with you, with my colleagues on the Commission,
and with FTC staff, if confirmed.
Mr. Phillips. Senator, thank you. As we discussed
yesterday, for a lot of Americans, it's really frustrating to
face large corporations that maybe they can't even access, the
errors of which can result in really bad outcomes for all those
people. And it can affect millions of Americans. If confirmed,
I look forward to getting briefed on what the agency is doing,
what it can be doing, and working with you and your staff on
that issue.
Mr. Chopra. Senator Schatz, this is an industry where you
cannot vote with your feet. When consumers can't take their
business elsewhere, competitive dynamics cannot address certain
consumer harms. And just in 2017, we've seen a number of
serious issues come to light in this industry. In one case, the
court found that a credit bureau was falsely marking consumers
as terrorists and drug kingpins. And we have to get to these
core accuracy issues, and this is something that I think really
warrants bipartisan attention about what we can do to make sure
the plumbing of our consumer financial infrastructure is
working better.
We need to use the Fair Credit Reporting Act and enforce it
vigorously as well as the other laws. And I agree that the
Commission needs to amp up its work with respect to consumer
reporting agencies.
Senator Schatz. Thank you.
My final question is for Mr. Chopra, and I think I've
spoken to all of you about this. I'm very interested in this
area of predictive algorithms. Some of it is just simple data
analytics that were available to us decades ago, but some of it
is getting more robust and sophisticated. I'm very interested
in the space because it's not clear who has jurisdiction. Some
of it may be DOJ, some of it may be HUD, some of it may be the
FTC--of these predictive algorithms that can essentially serve
as a proxy for race or for geographic location, for disability
status, for income. And so the degree and extent that some of
these predictive algorithms are sold as a product either to a
government or a company, but they're a black box because
they're proprietary, it's very difficult to determine whether
laws are being violated.
So I'm wondering whether you can all take a look at this.
I'll take Mr. Chopra in person and the rest of you for the
record on this question.
Mr. Chopra. Yes, Senator. Fifty years ago almost, we passed
the Fair Credit Reporting Act to make sure that there weren't
secret databases making decisions about our lives without
consumers having access to that data. And increasingly outside
of the credit reporting sector, the industry of data brokers
and other sectors are using more and more data. The FTC did
publish a big data report that highlighted some of those
issues. But I look forward to working with you and others so
that we can figure out what the industry dynamics and potential
issues for consumers are.
Senator Schatz. Thank you.
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Schatz.
Senator Udall.
STATEMENT OF HON. TOM UDALL,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW MEXICO
Senator Udall. Thank you. Thank you very much, Chairman
Thune.
And I'd like to direct a couple of comments and questions
to Mr. Simons here initially.
How will you prioritize the significant number of issues
that are currently pending before the Commission?
Mr. Simons. So, Senator, thank you for the question. A
first priority for the Commission, if I am confirmed, is going
to be making sure we are doing vigorous enforcement, both on
the consumer protection side, and on the competition side, and
that we do it in a way that gets the biggest bang for the
taxpayers' dollar, and that would be to focus our attentions
mostly where harm is the greatest. So that's how I would
prioritize things, Senator.
Senator Udall. Now, given the increased number of issues
before the FTC, what are your views on the adequacy of the
current FTC budget, and how will you ensure the Commission has
the resources necessary to protect consumers?
Mr. Simons. Senator, I pledge that I will look carefully at
the FTC budget, if confirmed, and make sure that we have what
we need to do the job that we need to do, and if we don't, I
will come to you and ask for--well, I won't come to you, but
I'll ask for more money.
Senator Udall. Great. Thank you.
As we discussed in our meeting, and it was a very good
meeting, I'm concerned about the ability of Federal agencies to
protect their networks against cyber intrusions, including the
use of bots targeted against public comment systems. Can you
address the ways you will empower or elevate the FTC's CIO?
Mr. Simons. Yes. One of the things that I'm going to do, if
confirmed, when I first get to the FTC is to talk to the CIO
and the folks there who are dealing with these issues. This is
a big concern for me, it's an important concern, and I want to
address it quickly.
Senator Udall. I have a long history of working with the
Federal Trade Commission on false labeling of sports equipment,
especially sports equipment targeted to young people. The FTC
has done some very good work there. Specifically, it sent
letters to retailers and manufacturers calling out certain
deceptive practices. However, it is important that the FTC
continue to monitor for future misleading labeling. Will you
commit to me to continue to monitor the marketplace, including
both traditional and online retailers and use the enforcement
authority of the FTC for any marketer or manufacturer
repeatedly making false claims?
Mr. Simons. I would be happy to make that commitment. This
is an issue that is near and dear to my heart. As we discussed
in your office, my son had a serious concussion while playing
football in high school, and so I saw the effects of that. And
so it's very, very important to me.
Senator Udall. Great. Thank you.
This next question is addressed to all nominees. Consumers
are purchasing more and more items that are connected to the
Internet, but they may not understand the enormous amount of
data that those items may collect. These items can include
children's toys or monitoring devices. Can you talk about the
actions that the FTC can take to help educate consumers about
data collection practices of manufacturers and other companies?
What are your ideas on how to promote consumer protection in an
increasingly online and connected world?
Why don't we start with Mr. Chopra down there.
Mr. Chopra. Senator Udall, I think consumer education and
engagement to increase understanding about the sheer volume,
growing on an exponential basis, of data collected is
important. I want to particularly underscore that collection of
data on children, servicemembers, and other pockets of our
populations probably warrant more specific attention. Of
course, the Congress already has certain protections in place
that address children's privacy, that address privacy of
students, and I think we should continue to dig deep to figure
out how we'll increase understanding and awareness by
consumers.
Senator Udall. Great.
Mr. Phillips.
Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Senator. I largely agree with what
my colleagues have said, and I think your focus on consumer
education could not be more important. There is a lot that the
FTC can do, but outreach to the consumer community, to the
business community, to particularly affected groups, like the
military, the elderly, and, in particular, the parents of kids
I think is essential. Also, using Members of Congress and the
abilities that they have to get the word out. I think all those
things are critical.
Senator Udall. Yes.
Ms. Wilson, let me interrupt you there because my time is
really gone here. But I wanted to make a plug, and I bet
Senator Blumenthal will join me on this, a plug for the FTC
working with state attorneys general. Both of us were attorneys
general sometime in our career, and it just seems to me that
you can amplify consumer efforts by doing that. State attorneys
general have their ear to the ground, they hear directly from
consumers. Many in many states have these very strong consumer
protection laws, and the attorneys general are out there doing
that. So I think a good working relationship with state
attorneys general would help you kind of amplify the work that
you do.
So with that, I'm finished, Mr. Chairman. Sorry for running
over a little bit.
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Udall.
Senator Hassan.
STATEMENT OF HON. MAGGIE HASSAN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEW HAMPSHIRE
Senator Hassan. Thank you very much, Mr. Chair.
Good morning to all of our nominees. Congratulations on
your nomination. And to all of the family members of the
nominees who are here, thank you for supporting your loved ones
in this process. It is a family affair. And I am very, very
grateful, especially to the children in the audience, who are
going to be sharing their parents with the American people, and
they deserve our thanks for that, too.
I want to start with a question for you, Mr. Chopra. Given
your finance background, I want to ask you about student loan
scams. Predatory student loan providers remain a serious
problem for American consumers. These companies exploit
vulnerable young people by charging outrageously high, often
illegal upfront fees in addition to monthly charges. The FTC in
several states began a crackdown on this kind of activity last
fall, but it is clear that more needs to be done at the Federal
level to make sure that these kind of predatory companies
cannot operate anywhere and harm consumers in the United
States. What more can the FTC do to fight this kind of
predatory lending behavior?
Mr. Chopra. Well, Senator Hassan, this bears an uncanny
resemblance to the foreclosure crisis where, as mortgages went
bad, foreclosure relief firms, many of which were fraudulent,
preyed on so many communities that were hit hard by
foreclosures.
There is a student loan default in this country once every
28 seconds.
Senator Hassan. Wow.
Mr. Chopra. That's 3,000 a day, over a million a year, and
we discussed this. I know there has been some criticism of the
FTC on being late to this, but I really think that the staff
has done a terrific job on its student debt relief work, and I
think we need to amplify that work and look to work with
attorneys general and others to make sure that we are not
allowing a repeat of what we saw in the aftermath of the
foreclosure crisis.
Senator Hassan. Thank you very much for that answer.
This is a question for the panel, and again we have limited
time, so I'll start with Mr. Simons and work down. But in the
past, the FTC has looked at videogames, issuing a report on the
marketing of violent videogames to children in 2009 and in
2013. It also studied the Entertainment Software Rating Board,
or ESRB, finding, one of the most effective voluntary
enforcement boards. That's why I'm confident that the ESRB will
take this issue seriously. So today I am sending a letter to
the ESRB outlining my concerns with microtransactions, which
may take the form of loot boxes, that's what they're called,
and allow in-game purchases for surprise winnings, and in many
cases, these are being marketed to and used by children who are
obviously particularly susceptible to being addicted to them.
Last month, the World Health Organization recognized gaming
disorder as a diagnosable disorder. We should be doing all we
can to protect our children and to inform parents about their
options when it comes to these types of games.
So the question for you, Do you agree that children being
addicted to gaming and activities like loot boxes that might
make them more susceptible to addiction, is a problem that
merits our attention? And depending on how the ESRB responds to
my inquiry, would the FTC be willing to look at loot boxes as
an issue independently?
And I'll start with you, Mr. Simons.
Mr. Simons. Yes, I would agree on both counts.
Senator Hassan. OK. Thank you.
Ms. Wilson.
Ms. Wilson. As the mother of two teenagers, I would agree
that the extent to which teenagers play videogames is certainly
of concern, and I would be willing to talk with FTC staff and
your office to get more up to speed on this issue, should I be
confirmed.
Senator Hassan. Thank you very much.
Mr. Phillips.
Mr. Phillips. Yes, Senator. While I am not yet expert on
this issue, I have credible reason to believe that I will
become or be forced to be an expert on it going forward. And I
look forward to working with career staff, with my colleagues,
and with you on that issue.
Senator Hassan. Thank you.
Mr. Chopra.
Mr. Chopra. Yes, Senator.
Senator Hassan. Well, thank you.
I have one more question that will take up far more than
the 45 seconds I have left. So why don't I decide to submit
that in writing. Thank you all very, very much.
And I yield back my time, Mr. Chair.
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Hassan.
Senator Cantwell.
STATEMENT OF HON. MARIA CANTWELL,
U.S. SENATOR FROM WASHINGTON
Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
And welcome to all of the panelists here. And
congratulations on your nominations.
Many of my colleagues have already asked about data breach
or privacy issues in general, but I wanted to ask you each
whether you thought, given the Equifax issues that we've seen
and the 5 weeks that it took to notify the public that the
breach had happened, whether you think that we should have more
rigorous mandatory or rigorous guidelines on notification for
data breach?
Mr. Simons. Thank you, Senator. I think that's something
definitely worth looking at. If confirmed, I would want to talk
to the FTC staff about it, get their views, talk to my fellow
Commissioners, and, of course, talk to you and other members of
the Committee.
Senator Cantwell. But do you think 5 weeks is too long?
Mr. Simons. I don't have a good basis to reach a conclusion
at this point. One of the things that I understand is an issue
is sometimes you want to make sure that you know what the
breach is about, and hopefully you can fix it before you have
to announce it. So sometimes it depends on the facts of the
case and whether the breach notification is more appropriate
sooner or later, but just as a general matter. But in terms of
the notification itself and potential legislation, that's
something I would definitely be interested in.
Senator Cantwell. Ms. Wilson or any of the other witnesses?
Mr. Chopra. Well, I want to be careful not to prejudice any
existing investigation, but I do think the data breach at
Equifax was a wakeup call about the patchwork of state laws
that we have and the appropriateness of how consumers are
informed and how they are impacted by it. And so I'm very
interested in working with all of you on data breach and data
security issues because it is only going to be more frequent.
It is not just impacting consumers and businesses, it impacts
so many facets of our life, including our national security.
Senator Cantwell. Do you think 5 weeks is too long?
Mr. Chopra. Again, I don't want to prejudice any ongoing
investigation, but as a general matter and not speaking about
any specific situation, several weeks after a major breach of
personal data does not sound like it is fast enough.
Senator Cantwell. Mr. Phillips or Ms. Wilson?
Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Senator. Like my colleagues, I
understand that the FTC has announced that it is investigating
that matter, so I don't want to speak specifically to it lest
what I say impact that investigation in any way, but obviously
that is a major issue. And I look forward to working with my
colleagues, staff at the agency, and with you on what is
appropriate.
Senator Cantwell. Ms. Wilson?
Ms. Wilson. I agree that this is a significant issue. I
have spoken with my colleagues here at the table today. We
recognize that the Federal Trade Commission is going to spend a
great deal of time and energy investigating these issues and
figuring out how best to serve the American consumer. And so I
would join my colleagues in saying I don't want to prejudice an
ongoing investigation, but I look forward to talking with
staff, receiving briefing based on nonpublic information, if
confirmed, and then talking with you further about additional
authority or legislation that may be required.
Senator Cantwell. Yes. I guess I was hoping--I mean, I
think the facts are well known because they've been in the
press, and I'm pretty sure this Committee had a hearing on it,
so I'm pretty sure we're familiar with the fact that there was
a patch, a software fix, available, and yet it wasn't applied
within the company, and now 145 million people's personal data
has been, you know, impacted.
So I think the thing that we want to understand is what
your personal views are on how important it is you think the
FTC play an aggressive role here in filling the gap. If you, as
FTC members, are not thinking aggressively about this issue and
what role we need to play in monitoring how to protect
consumers on privacy, then that's of great concern to me, and
I'm pretty sure it will be of great concern to my constituents.
I do have some questions about your current
antimanipulation authority as it relates to energy and oil
markets and--but I see my time is about to expire, Mr.
Chairman, so I'll submit that for the record.
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Cantwell.
Senator Capito.
Senator Capito. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank all of you for your willingness to serve.
I'm going to piggyback on Mr. Blumenthal's question on
prescription drug pricing because we see a lot of consolidation
in this industry. As an example, there is continued
consolidation in the PDM industry, where large companies
dominate the market. Many of these companies also own
proprietary pharmacies, retail, and mail-order, which compete
with our local retail pharmacies, often on an uneven playing
field. As somebody who represents a state with a lot of
seniors, this obviously is very important.
So, Mr. Simons, how do you expect to deal with this at the
FTC and how are you--I saw you shaking your head, so----
Mr. Simons. So I agree wholeheartedly with that concern.
One of the things I want to do at the Commission, which is
spelled out in a little more detail in my response to the
Committee's questionnaire, is to establish a merger
retrospective program so that we look at self-critically
whether our merger enforcement has been as effective as it
should be. And if it hasn't, why hasn't it? And see how we can
fix it.
So as part of that, that look-back, I think it might make
sense to look at the industry you're describing, and that will
help us determine whether, you know, what the problem is and
how to fix it.
Senator Capito. Right. Yes.
Mr. Phillips, did you have a comment on that?
Mr. Phillips. Yes, Senator. And thank you for your
question. I don't need to tell you that the price of health
care for Americans may be the number one issue in many of their
lives financially speaking.
The FTC has a proud decades-long bipartisan track record of
working on helping to keep competition going in health care
markets, from reviewing mergers of hospitals to policing
prescription drug prices. If confirmed, I look forward to
working and making that issue a priority.
Senator Capito. Ms. Wilson?
Ms. Wilson. I agree with Mr. Phillips, that the Federal
Trade Commission has a long and rich history of ensuring
competition in health care markets, including in prescription
drug markets. This is an area where, under Chairman Muris, the
FTC spent a great deal of time and effort. It is an important
one for all Americans given that health care costs now account
for almost one-fifth of GDP.
And so I agree with my colleagues, this is an area where I
anticipate, if confirmed, spending a great deal of time and
effort.
Senator Capito. I'm going to jump to another topic real
quick because, again, our time is short.
Ms. Wilson, you and I talked about this when you were in
the office, I think with Mr. Simons, too, is this
telemarketing, the new spoofing that we all see coming across
our phones. But also robocalls in telemarketing has taken on a
whole different form than the original Do Not Call Registry
list that we saw that developed successfully.
Several of you mentioned this in your statements, about the
real need for technology and the Commission's technological
experts to keep ahead of the next algorithms that are being
developed to get around the rules or to reach the consumer.
So, Ms. Wilson, you had a good answer for that for me in my
office, and I wonder if you could put it on the record for me,
please?
Ms. Wilson. Absolutely. Under Chairman Muris, the
Commission launched the Do Not Call initiative. If Chairman
Muris were here today, he would tell you that was his 15
minutes of fame. Unfortunately, technology has now outpaced
that effort, and there are holes that need to be plugged.
Robocalls are essentially a form of harassment and are unlawful
under a variety of different statutes. We need to find a
technological solution and move forward with significant
enforcement in that area. And I look forward to working with my
colleagues and with you, if confirmed, to make sure we have the
solution for that issue.
Senator Capito. Thank you.
I'll just make a quick comment, and then, Mr. Chopra, I'll
let you make a comment.
Again, going back to seniors, this I think really impacts
ability for fraud for them and to be really taken advantage of,
not just emotionally, but financially and every other way. We
see it happening all the time.
Mr. Chopra, do you have a response?
Mr. Chopra. You read my mind. I was just going to share
that I think we also need to look at robocalls and
telemarketing issues, not as an inconvenience, but as a real
harm to many people. Many individuals do not have the luxury of
screening their calls. They might be waiting for a doctor's
call or the next job, and I think this is something we need to
remember, that it is not simply an annoyance.
Senator Capito. Thank you.
The Chairman. Thank you, Senator Capito.
Senator Lee.
STATEMENT OF HON. MIKE LEE,
U.S. SENATOR FROM UTAH
Senator Lee. Thanks to each of you for being willing to
serve and for being here to answer our questions.
Some of you might be familiar with the proposal known as
the SMARTER Act. The SMARTER Act is a piece of legislation that
would ensure that the Department of Justice antitrust officials
and the Federal Trade Commission officials would have to meet
the same standard when seeking a preliminary injunction to
block a proposed merger, and would also require the FTC to
litigate merger cases in Federal court instead of relying on
the administrative processes to which they have access.
At some points in the past, I've discussed these proposals
with individuals who will say, ``I don't necessarily see the
need for legislation like that, and don't like it because we
don't need it to be that way anyway. We already don't do those
things, and there's no reason to change it.''
So I guess I've got a couple of questions related to this.
So I'd like to have each of you tell me, number one, whether
there is any good reason to have a different standard
applicable to the FTC than applies to the Department of Justice
when either entity is trying to block a merger; and, number
two, whether you would ever authorize the filing of an
administrative complaint without seeking an injunction in
Federal court?
Go ahead. We'll start with Mr. Chopra.
Mr. Chopra. Market participants shouldn't have to navigate
multiple standards whenever possible. I want to explore this
more with you and others. One question I would have is with
respect to speed of the overall proceeding. Administrative
proceedings can sometimes be faster and cheaper for parties, so
that would be something I would look into. As a general matter,
though, I take your point that these issues may be best suited
for Federal court.
Senator Lee. Mr. Phillips.
Mr. Phillips. Thank you, Senator. It has been great to work
with your staff over the last 6 years.
My answer to the first question is I can't think of any
reason whatsoever. The law should not operate as an arbitrage
between which Federal agency you appear in front of. And
companies should not have to consider that question when
deciding whether and how to pursue mergers and acquisitions
activity.
As I said to you when we met, personally, I need to learn a
little bit more about the operation of Part 3. And if
confirmed, I look forward to working with my colleagues, with
career staff, and with you on that question.
Senator Lee. Great. Thank you.
Ms. Wilson.
Ms. Wilson. Thank you, Senator Lee. I think this is a very
important issue. I think it's a matter of good government that
businesses have clarity and predictability when they approach
the government, particularly given concurrent jurisdiction
between the FTC and DOJ. And so I do not believe there is a
good reason for differentiated standards. There are people who
will tell you that the standards as applied essentially come
out the same way, but I think there is a great deal of value in
conveying to businesses and the public that the agencies apply
the same standard.
In terms of where complaints are brought, I would think as
a general rule for unconsummated mergers, seeking a PI in
Federal court would be my inclination. Obviously, there may be
extenuating circumstances that should be considered, and I
would want to talk with FTC staff about that. But I think as a
general rule, seeking a PI in Federal court would be the right
way to go for unconsummated mergers.
Senator Lee. OK. Mr. Simons.
Mr. Simons. Thank you, Senator. I don't see any reason why
there should be two standards. I am one of those people who,
though, agrees, as a matter of practice, that the same standard
is applied. But I see no reason why it shouldn't be cleaned up
and made very clear.
In terms of where the FTC files its merger challenges, I
think generally it should be in the Federal court. There should
be one bite at the apple. The litigation should occur in the
Federal court, and if the agency loses there, they shouldn't
then be going to administrative trial.
Senator Lee. Excellent. I appreciate that answer very much,
and that is very helpful.
In any case, whether we're talking about antitrust law or
otherwise, but particularly relevant here, since we're talking
not about a hypothetical, but about real-world situations,
someone's fate, as a litigant, ought not be determined by the
toss of a coin, the type of random decision that might dictate
that a proposed merger be reviewed by this agency or the other.
So when we have differing substantive standards that apply to
one versus the other, when one is required to go before a
Federal court and the other has another option, to me, that
makes no sense. No one has ever explained to me an adequate
reason why there ought to be two completely different systems.
I understand the efficiency argument, that one has been
made in the past, but the fact that something might be more
efficient for the government ought not change someone's access
to due process, which is what our system is all about.
I see my time is expired, and the Chairman is giving me
that look.
[Laughter.]
Senator Lee. But I thank each of you for your thoughtful
answers.
The Chairman. I never give the Senator from Utah that look.
But thank you, Senator Lee.
Senator Wicker is up next. I have to depart for a meeting
on infrastructure, but I will say to our nominees that we hope
to move very quickly your nominations to the floor, and it's
important that we get those important seats on the Commission
filled. So thank you for your willingness to serve. And to your
families who are here today, too, their willingness to serve
and sacrifice as well because we all know how all these
positions are very much family efforts. So thank you.
Senator Wicker.
STATEMENT OF HON. ROGER F. WICKER,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MISSISSIPPI
Senator Wicker [presiding]. Thank you. We'll now move to an
eight-minute rule.
[Laughter.]
Senator Wicker. And you enjoy yourself at that other
meeting.
Let me drill down on a specific issue, and then I'll back
up and ask a more general one.
To all of you, thank you for meeting with me in my office.
And I have a really good feeling that we're going to be able to
work together in a bipartisan manner. But let me ask about the
contact lens rule.
And I guess I'll just start with you, Mr. Simons. Where are
we on that? As I understand it, the optometrists have always
followed a rule that you write the prescription, and, of
course, they're willing to fill it themselves, but also they
write out the prescription, always give it to the patient or
consumer, and it's up to the consumer to decide where to get
that prescription filled. Now there's a new rule, which some of
our providers think is a solution in search of a problem, that
the patient must now sign that they got the prescription and
putting the provider in a position of being a recordkeeper for
several years.
So where are we on that rule? And without asking any of you
to say how you would rule on that, what is your general feeling
about taking into consideration the fact that we already have a
rule that's working pretty well, and that this would put an
administrative burden on people who are just trying to provide
services?
So I'll start with you, Mr. Simons.
Mr. Simons. Thank you, Senator. So the rule revision is
under consideration, under active consideration, at the
Commission. I believe the Commission has scheduled, I think in
March, another session to collect more information that will
help it in its decisionmaking process. So I don't want to
prejudge the result of that, but I have to say that, you know,
if it ain't broke, don't fix it, if it turns out those are the
facts.
Senator Wicker. Anyone else want to comment? I know we did
talk about this.
Ms. Wilson.
Ms. Wilson. I would agree with Mr. Simons, Senator.
Senator Wicker. OK. Does anybody else want to add?
Mr. Chopra. I think we need to be very attentive to
imposing requirements and burdens on our smallest entities,
especially if they don't have economies of scale. So, as we
discussed, Senator, I will probe on some of the assumptions
around this and hope to make sure that we get a good solution
here.
Senator Wicker. OK. Now, Ms. Wilson, you mentioned, and I
was tickled to hear it, that we want to protect consumers,
including preserving competition, in health care markets. Wow,
if we could make some progress in this Committee or in this
Senate or in this Congress on that issue, we would be doing a
lot to help the American public.
Let me ask in particular, I hear concerns about the PBM
transparency, pharmacy benefit managers, and I know the public
doesn't understand it, but it is a source of huge frustration
to many. Given the continued consolidation and growing
negotiation leverage that PBMs have, what role should
transparency play to enhance competition and consumer
protection?
Ms. Wilson. To go back to what Senator Capito said about
me, I am a firm believer in free markets and robust
competition. You need to have full information and transparency
in order to achieve efficiently functioning markets. And so
without speaking particularly with respect to PBMs, more
information makes the market function more efficiently.
With respect to PBM consolidation, I would concur with Mr.
Simons that, if confirmed, it will be important to do merger
retrospectives to determine whether the antitrust agencies have
achieved the right balance in terms of permitting mergers that
would allow innovation and economies of scale while at the same
time blocking mergers or requiring remedies where they might
otherwise cause harm to competition.
Senator Wicker. Well, you know, in a larger sense, there is
just a lot of frustration with the pharmacists that have to
comply with these rules, often having to do things
retroactively to rectify problems that they didn't know about.
My time is up. Let me just say I'm glad to see at least
three of you, and possibly all of you, talk about
bipartisanship and the great tradition we have in this
Commission of not lining up 3 to 2 on so many issues as we've
seen elsewhere. So let me say that I heartily endorse that kind
of sentiment coming from a bipartisan panel today, and I hope
that tradition can continue to provide examples for future
boards and future candidates to talk about in a positive manner
in the future. So thank you very much.
And thank you, Madam Chair.
Senator Capito [presiding]. Thank you.
There has been a request for a break of 5 minutes, which we
have agreed to. So we're going to break for 5 minutes, and I'm
pretty strict on time. So it's 11:07. We're going to start back
at 11:12 promptly. Please--thank you. At the call of the Chair.
[Recess.]
Senator Capito. Thank you all for that. I will report it is
11:13. Pretty good for Senate time.
I would like to now call on Senator Markey.
STATEMENT OF HON. EDWARD MARKEY,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MASSACHUSETTS
Senator Markey. Thank you. You were just as good Sister
Superior at the Immaculate Conception Grammar School. You got
that whole break in perfectly.
Net neutrality. In December, Federal Trade Commission
Commissioner McSweeney wrote, quote, ``Scrapping the FCC's net
neutrality rules will harm consumers and content creators, and
the Federal Trade Commission isn't going to be able to stop it.
The Federal Trade Commission does not have specialized
expertise in telecommunications. We don't have engineers or
technical expertise in data network management practices. These
are very real and significant limits to the effectiveness of
the Federal Trade Commission's tools in ensuring that networks
are open and free of harmful discrimination.''
Mr. Chopra, do you agree with Commissioner McSweeney?
Mr. Chopra. I share a lot of the skepticism and concerns. I
would also add that given ongoing litigation and rulings in the
Ninth Circuit, the FTC may face an unlevel playing field where
some major market participants are exempt from the Commission's
authority while others are subject to it.
Senator Markey. Mr. Simons, do you agree with Mr.
McSweeney?
Mr. Simons. Thank you, Senator. My view is that the FTC, if
it gets back its authority in the internet space, is going to
be a vigorous enforcer. We're going to take the statutory
authority that we have and use it as best we can. I don't know
exactly what types of anticompetitive or deceptive and unfair
practices may come up. If those come up, we can reach them
under our statute. If something comes up that we can't reach
under our statute, then I would certainly come to you and the
Committee and talk to you about a legislative fix.
Senator Markey. Well, the Federal Trade Commission lacks
rulemaking authority, and the Federal Communications Commission
does have rulemaking authority to prevent blocking, throttling,
and paid prioritization by ISPs. You do agree with that?
Mr. Simons. We both have rulemaking, and they're different
types of rulemaking.
Senator Markey. But in terms of being able to deal with
those issues of throttling, paid prioritization, and blocking,
you do not have that authority.
Mr. Simons. I want to talk to the General Counsel's office
before I give a specific answer to that. I'm not entirely
clear.
Senator Markey. OK. Well----
Mr. Simons. Because--and in terms of--Senator, in terms
of--and----
Senator Markey. Just let me move on.
Mr. Simons. OK.
Senator Markey. I just want to reach a second----
Mr. Simons. Sure.
Senator Markey.--subject. And I will just say it does lack
the authority.
On kids' privacy, there is a growing body of evidence from
child development experts as well as former industry executives
that technologies are being purposefully made to be addictive.
And here's the goal of all these companies, it's like the
tobacco industry, you've got to get them early because then
they might be your lifetime customers, so you've got to get
them at 11, at 12, at 13, at 14, get them hooked, make it
addictive, and then you've got them for the rest of their
lives.
Under the Commission's Child Online Privacy Protection Act
mandate, which I am the author of in 1999, what will you do to
ensure that child-directed applications and the parent consent
processes are fashioned in ways that really protect privacy and
ensure that parents can make informed decisions about their
kids, and that includes investigations into data practices,
enabling profiling and targeting across devices, applications,
and services?
Mr. Chopra.
Mr. Chopra. Well, I agree that those laws first need to be
vigorously enforced. And, second, we've seen the market develop
so quickly in ways that parents and our whole society could not
see coming and the amount of data being collected on our
children continues to increase. I think we need to be very
vigilant and come back to you especially if we feel we don't
have adequate authorities to address this.
Senator Markey. Will you each commit to an active pro-child
privacy protection policy at the Federal Trade Commission
during your tenure if you are confirmed?
Mr. Simons.
Mr. Simons. Yes, absolutely.
Senator Markey. Ms. Wilson.
Ms. Wilson. Senator, I thank you for your leadership on
COPPA, and I agree.
Senator Markey. Great.
Mr. Phillips.
Mr. Phillips. If confirmed, absolutely.
Senator Markey. If confirmed. Thank you.
I just think that's going to be the cutting-edge set of
issues. It's time for these industries to come under scrutiny,
to be made accountable for what they are doing. I mean, the
public health implications of this now epidemic addiction
amongst young people, especially in the minority community,
much higher interestingly, than in other communities, is
something that we have to pay much closer attention to.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Senator Capito. Senator Klobuchar.
STATEMENT OF HON. AMY KLOBUCHAR,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MINNESOTA
Senator Klobuchar. Thank you.
And I want to thank Senator Cortez Masto for allowing me to
go before her.
We had very good meetings. Thank you, all of you. And I
appreciate as well your bipartisan work; that means a lot given
how important these issues are.
And I have three issues, and you can maybe pick who answers
them. The first is on the pay-for-delay issue. And I see former
Chair Leibowitz out there somewhere, something he had worked on
at length. We have had some court cases that changed this, but,
as you know, pharmaceutical prices have continued to increase.
Senator Grassley and I have a bill that basically says that you
can't make these deals to keep generics off the market. And I
just would like to get someone's thoughts on that and the
important role the FTC plays.
Mr. Phillips.
Mr. Phillips. Senator, thank you for your question. As a
Judiciary Committee staffer, I am well aware of yours and
Senator Grassley's interest in the issue. The President called
a few weeks ago for a focus on the cost of prescription drugs.
That is an issue that hits all Americans, myself included, in
the pocketbook every day, maybe every other day if we're a
little bit healthier than I probably am right now.
The FTC has a long bipartisan tradition of policing
anticompetitive conduct in prescription markets. And if
confirmed, I look forward to working with my fellow
Commissioners, career staff, with you, on continuing that.
Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you.
The second question, the cyber attack against Equifax
exposed the personal information of more than 145 million
Americans, essentially anyone that has a credit history. And I
recently sent a letter urging the FTC to broaden its
investigation of the Equifax data breach in response to reports
indicating that the Director of the Office of Management and
Budget had directed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau
investigators to pull back from their investigation.
Mr. Simons, what is the FTC's role in conducting this
investigation? And are you committed to advancing it?
Mr. Simons. So, Senator, I don't want to prejudge any
existing matter except to say that on any major issue,
certainly any major issue involving data breaches, I would
expect the Commission to be all over it, providing and using
the necessary resources and just being very vigorous.
Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you.
Then my third and final area is antitrust. I am the Ranking
along with Senator Lee, who chairs the Antitrust Subcommittee
in Judiciary. And last fall I introduced the Merger Enforcement
Improvement Act as well as the Consolidation Prevention and
Competition Promotion Act to enhance the ability of antitrust
agencies to conduct enforcement in the current wave of
consolidation. And ensuring that the agencies have the
financial and legal resources to protect competition I believe
is more important than ever as these deals become more
sophisticated as you see this kind of takeover of certain
areas, and especially what you're seeing right now in the
bills.
As you know, one is focused on getting more resources by
having a fee on some of the megamergers, something that I hope
is not that controversial, so taxpayers aren't footing the bill
here for these complex reviews from the FTC as well as
antitrust in Justice. And then the second one is more focused
on acknowledging the changes we've seen and looking at
monopsonies and other things.
So, Mr. Chopra, in the current economic climate, should
merger enforcement be a priority for the FTC in the near to
medium future? And why? And what can we do to bolster merger
enforcement?
Mr. Chopra. Well, of course, as I shared earlier, we face
issues with barriers to entry in so many industries with small
business starts at a low.
One of the observations I have about the Commission and
government agencies in general is that it's not so easy to
adapt its personnel and workforce to changing market
conditions. The interest rate environment and what the markets
tell us is that these deals will be robust, they will be big,
and whether the Commission has adequate resources and
flexibility to vigorously police in a timely fashion, I think
that's an open question for me, and I would like to work
further on that with you.
Senator Klobuchar. OK. Thank you.
And, Ms. Wilson, I promise to send you a question on the
record because I'm going to give it over to Catherine Cortez
Masto because she was so kind. So thank you.
Senator Capito. Senator Cortez Masto.
STATEMENT OF HON. CATHERINE CORTEZ MASTO,
U.S. SENATOR FROM NEVADA
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you very much.
Senator Capito. You're welcome.
Senator Cortez Masto. A pleasure to meet some of you and
talk with you. And I know I've got some future meetings.
Welcome to all of the family members. All of you have been
patient, although fidgeting a little I see over here, compared
to the young kids over there.
[Laughter.]
Senator Cortez Masto. But welcome, welcome. And we're
almost done.
So let me start with a couple of questions just for all of
you if you don't mind answering just in a short answer. Can I
get your commitment to be an active consumer protection agency,
including on marketing practices and data security and privacy?
Mr. Simons, I'll start with you.
Mr. Simons. That's an easy yes, Senator.
Ms. Wilson. Absolutely yes, Senator.
Mr. Phillips. Absolutely, Senator.
Mr. Chopra. Yes. And I would add the Commission also needs
to be a key partner with attorneys general and others on this.
Senator Cortez Masto. Good. That was another follow-up
question I had for you. Thank you.
What do you envision is the most contentious and difficult
set of consumer protections coming before you if you are
confirmed?
Mr. Simons, I'll start with you.
Mr. Simons. I think it's how we handle the data breaches.
They're becoming, you know, much more significant, much more
frequent, and I think that's a real, real, real serious concern
for us and that we need to pay close attention to it.
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
Ms. Wilson. I would agree with Mr. Simons. When I was at
the Commission in the early 2000s with Chairman Muris, we spent
a great deal of time working on data security and consumer
privacy issues. And I foresee the same, frankly, in the coming
years, if confirmed.
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
Mr. Phillips. I agree with my colleagues, Senator. I would
add, though, we can't allow contentious issues to distract us
from the bread and butter of the agency on the consumer
protection side, looking out for children, veterans, the
elderly, and Americans generally.
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
Mr. Chopra. I would agree on the issues related to big
data. I would also add that it implicates the consumer
protection mission as well as the competition and privacy
missions, and it needs to be very high on the list, if not the
highest. And the data breach at Equifax also underscores how
the Fair Credit Reporting Act and oversight of the credit
reporting agencies needs to be paramount.
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. And then let's talk about
interaction with states. How do you envision your interaction
with the states and the attorneys general on matters that you
have similar when it comes to unfair and deceptive trade
practices and competition?
And I'll start with Mr. Simons.
Mr. Simons. Very close working relationship. I think
they're critical to us using our assets most efficiently and
them using their assets most efficiently. So I'm very much in
favor of a very close working relationship.
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
Ms. Wilson. Senator, not surprisingly, I agree with Mr.
Simons. I think it is very important to have a close
relationship with the state attorneys general, who can be, in
many instances, more familiar with the facts on the ground.
Mr. Phillips. Senator, I agree with all of that. As you
know well, state attorneys general can be a force multiplier
for the FTC. They also are closer to the ground and may
understand issues and how they're impacting consumers better
than we do. We need to continue those relationships. I would
only add that we also need to work collaboratively with other
parts of the Federal Government because there are some areas
where we may not have expertise, but those other parts do.
Senator Cortez Masto. OK.
Mr. Chopra. Senator, as you know, I've worked very
frequently with the attorneys general on enforcement matters
over the years, and I would also like to see us go beyond the
attorneys general to other state officials who have unique
expertise and authorities because that can be a different
leverage point to make sure that taxpayer resources are being
used effectively.
Senator Cortez Masto. OK. And then how do you see the FTC
continuing to work with the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau to take action against companies that intentionally
mislead auto buyers, students, and elderly homeowners?
Mr. Chopra. Well, Senator, I'll start----
Senator Cortez Masto. Lead off, and then I'll ask all of
you.
Mr. Chopra. The CFPB and the FTC have an existing
memorandum of understanding to coordinate enforcement matters
as well as other tools in its toolbox. I think it's going to be
especially critical to coordinate with the CFPB on those
specific special population issues as well as areas where there
is co-extensive jurisdiction, including the Fair Credit
Reporting Act, among other things.
Senator Cortez Masto. And let me just ask Mr. Simons the
same question.
Mr. Simons. Yes, I agree with Mr. Chopra.
Senator Cortez Masto. And then--this is great. To the
extent that I've seen this communication, bipartisan, everybody
working together, but let me ask you, Mr. Simons, if you are
the Chair, how do you incorporate the board members in everyday
decisionmaking and enforcement in moving forward?
Mr. Simons. Yes. As far as I'm concerned, I would foresee
this being ``Team FTC.'' We are very fortunate that all the
nominees have significant expertise, and some of it is very
complementary, and I would want to definitely make use of that.
Senator Cortez Masto. OK. Thank you very much.
Senator Capito. Thank you.
Senator Cruz.
STATEMENT OF HON. TED CRUZ,
U.S. SENATOR FROM TEXAS
Senator Cruz. Thank you very much.
Congratulations to all four of the nominees. I spent 2
years at the FTC in the early 2000s, and it is a wonderful
institution with tremendously talented career professionals and
with a terrific and longstanding tradition of really effective
bipartisan cooperation, enforcing the antitrust laws, defending
competition, and protecting consumers. And so I want to commend
each of you for your willingness to serve.
I'll note a number of you, we go back a long way.
Mr. Phillips, we've worked together the last 5 years with
you doing very good work with Senator Cornyn. It's been a
pleasure working with you. Sorry to see you leave us, but
you're going on to do good things.
And, Mr. Simons, Ms. Wilson, we were all together with Tim
Muris at the FTC, and it was a wonderful team. It was a
pleasure working with the both of you each and every day for
those 2 years. You both did, I think, an extraordinary job
during your tenure there. And I think we were blessed to serve
under Chairman Tim Muris, who was, quite frankly,
extraordinary. I don't think there has been another Chairman
before or since that had the scope and breadth and vision that
Tim brought to that job every day.
So a question I wanted to ask, especially the both of you,
because you worked with Tim every day, is, What positive
lessons did you learn from your tenure working under Chairman
Muris? And how would you expect to implement those lessons
going forward, should you be confirmed?
Mr. Simons. Thank you, Senator. And let me just say I look
very fondly back on those days, and that was clearly by far, by
wide margin, the best job I ever had, and for all the reasons
that you just described.
So one of the things, one of the most important things, I
learned from Chairman Muris was that it's important to have
your priorities, to communicate them well so that the staff
knows what's expected, what types of matters will turn into
enforcement actions, and so the staff is busy and doing very
productive things and have very high morale. That's an
absolutely critical thing I think in terms of leading the FTC,
and that's my intent, to follow that lead from Chairman Muris.
Ms. Wilson. Thank you, Senator. I would echo Mr. Simons'
comments. It was a pleasure to work with you and to get to know
you then, and I've watched your career since then with great
interest and support.
In terms of the things that I learned from Chairman Muris,
first of all, I would echo what Mr. Simons said. It is very
important to have a positive agenda. If you go in without a
positive agenda, you are reacting to external forces and you
are losing an opportunity to shape policy and to make important
progress, frankly, in the mission of the agency.
Second, I would note, perhaps in a self-interested way,
that Chairman Muris was very good at enlisting all of the
Commissioners to help advance his positive agenda. I think it's
important for Mr. Simons, if confirmed, to capitalize on the
unique experiences and expertise that each of us bring to the
table. And in the words of Mr. Phillips, that will be
essentially a force multiplier for him and for the agency.
And third, I would note that Chairman Muris was excellent
at advancing competition advocacy. He ensured that the FTC was
a voice for free markets and for minimal regulation to the
extent feasible, while still protecting consumers, both at the
Federal level and at the State level. You, as head of the
Office of Policy and Planning, played a very important role in
some of those initiatives. And what Acting Chairman Maureen
Ohlhausen has been doing is also very important in terms of
economic liberty and working with state AGs to understand the
hindrance that licensing requirements can impose.
And then taking that competition advocacy into the global
arena as well.
Tim was there when we launched the International
Competition Network. Having the FTC and the Department of
Justice together in a leadership role speaking into the
international arena and supporting the sound enforcement of
competition and consumer protection laws is critical for
American consumers and also for American companies.
Senator Cruz. Mr. Simons, what are your views on
competition advocacy and the robust role the FTC has had in
that in the past?
Mr. Simons. I don't think I could do better justice to it
than what Ms. Wilson just said. It's absolutely critical. It's
had really tremendous effects historically. And I would expect
that to continue into the future.
Senator Cruz. Let me ask one final question, which is a
number of members of this Committee are concerned about the
scope and control of big tech.
Mr. Simons. Yes.
Senator Cruz. That the size and power of it is
unprecedented. There was an article just recently in Esquire
that pointed out that Facebook and Google together are worth
$1.3 trillion, which you could merge the world's top five
advertising agencies: WPP, Omnicom, Publicis, IPG, and Dentsu;
the five major media companies Disney, Time Warner, 21st
Century Fox, CBS, and Viacom; and add also the five major
communications companies: AT&T, Verizon, Comcast, Charter, and
Dish; and you'd only get to 90 percent of what Google and
Facebook are worth. The scope of market power and size and
control of public discourse is unprecedented. How should the
Commission approach this development, which I find
unprecedented?
Mr. Simons. You know, it's a funny thing. It reminds me of
when people used to--the old joke about when people would ask
Jesse James why he robbed banks? It's because that's where the
money is, right? And so with respect to antitrust, the
corollary is the place most likely to have antitrust problems
is places that have market power, right? And so those are the
places you want to look the most, those are the places you want
to make sure you're monitoring carefully and paying attention
to, and if anticompetitive conduct is occurring there, that's
where you get a big bang for the taxpayer's buck, by
enforcement in those areas.
Senator Cruz. Thank you.
Senator Capito. Thank you.
Senator Moran.
STATEMENT OF HON. JERRY MORAN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM KANSAS
Senator Moran. Chairman Capito, thank you very much. I
appreciate the opportunity to have a conversation.
And I appreciate all of you visiting with me in my office
yesterday.
I am also a member of the Appropriations Committee, which
is responsible for the funding of the FTC. And as you are
probably aware--and maybe I'll direct this at Mr. Simons--the
FTC was allocated $313 million for FY17, and earlier this week,
the White House revealed its 2019 budget included $309.7
million for the FTC, which is about $3 million more than last
year's budget request. As Congress attempts to appropriate the
necessary resources for your agencies, what would you remind me
to be prioritizing from your view?
Mr. Simons. So one of the things obviously, if confirmed,
that I would do relatively quickly is get a handle on the
budget and what the resource allocation looks like and also
reach out to the staff and make sure I understand where the
Commission's money is being spent and how well it's being
spent.
In terms of the budgetary issues, you know, I don't know
enough at this point to tell you that we need more or we could
do okay with less. But, you know, my feeling at this point
would be keep the ship steady.
Senator Moran. To make sure I'm not stepping on toes, the
Subcommittee that funds this is chaired by Senator Capito.
Senator Capito. Yes.
[Laughter.]
Senator Moran. Let me--Mr.--Senator Blumenthal is here as
well. He and I have recently submitted a letter to Acting
Chairwoman Ohlhausen seeking an investigation into the
deceptive and fraudulent practices that purport health plans
increase their social media presence among real users while
actually selling fake followers and interactions. I would ask
unanimous consent to submit that letter that Senator Blumenthal
and I sent to the Chairwoman.
Senator Capito. Without objection.
Senator Moran. Thank you.
[The letter referred to follows:]
United States Senate
Washington. DC, January 30, 2018
Hon. Maureen Ohlhausen,
Acting Chairman,
Federal Trade Commission,
Washington, DC.
Dear Acting Chairman Townhouse:
We write regarding the disturbing New York Times investigation over
the weekend into Devurni, an American company that sells a panoply of
social media actions, including followers, on some of the biggest
social media websites, including Twitter and YouTube.\1\ The company
bills itself as a marketing company that can help clients increase
their social media presence. In reality, the company allegedly uses
bots to create fake social media accounts--evidently deceiving its own
clients and creating tens of thousands of victims of a unique kind of
social identity theft. This company seems engaged in unfair or
deceptive practices, and we urge you to use all the tools at your
disposal to take immediate action to investigate this company, along
with any other similar services, and shut down any fraudulent practices
they are engaged in.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

oscial-mcdia-bots.html
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devumi's website--still live--offers any clients willing to pay a
smorgasbord of social media influence: followers, retweets, and likes
on Twitter; views, subscribers, likes, dislikes, and shares on Google's
YouTube; plays, followers, likes, reposts, and comments on SoundCloud,
the music-hosting site; followers, likes, and repins on Pinterest, the
discovery and inspiration site; plays and followers on Vimeo; and
followers and endorsements on LinkedIn, the professional networking
site.
The advertising on Devumi's website belies its reported practice of
purchasing bots to generate fake social media accounts and
interactions. For example, regarding its YouTube related services,
Devumi advertises, ``100 percent Real Views from Real People.'' \2\ Yet
this is clearly not the case. According to data analysis by The Times,
Devumi operates from ``an estimated stock of at least 3.5 million
automated accounts.'' Even worse, Devumi appears to be complicit in a
massive social media identity theft operation. At least 55,000 of these
accounts use ``the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other
personal details of real Twitter users, including minors.''
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Devumi's fraudulent practices are likely linked to widespread
consumer harms. The inflated number of followers, retweets, and the
like enabled by Devumi's services have the effect of distorting the
online marketplace and creating a false sense of celebrity,
credibility, or importance in people, companies, or institutions that
may not deserve it.
As you know, Section 5 of the FTC Act (15 U.S.C. Sec. 45) provides
the FTC authority to bring enforcement actions against deceptive or
unfair marketing practices. We urge you to use this statutory auth01ity
to investigate deceptive and unfair practices of these social media
influencing services and take appropriate action. We respectfully
request a response by February 14, 2018.
Sincerely,
Jerry Moran
Chairman
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and
Data Security
Richard Blumenthal
Ranking Member
Subcommittee on Consumer Protection, Product Safety, Insurance, and
Data Security
Senator Moran. Section 5 of the FTC Act provides the agency
enforcement authority to take action against deceptive or
unfair marketing practices. And I feel strongly this practice
needs to be investigated. What are some of the inherent
consumer harms of allowing social media bots to be sold to
individuals and companies? What kind of market distortions
would you expect from this behavior? In other words, what's
your take on the circumstances that, as reported in the press,
of a young girl finding herself, her identity, being utilized
in such a deceptive and damaging way?
Mr. Chopra. Well, sales and marketing is often more
effective with more trust, and the extent to which these
practices are undermining trust and how consumers are
communicating back and forth with firms, that's obviously
something we need to be concerned about. Deception has some
specific legal criteria, so I look forward to reviewing your
letter more closely and seeing how we can address that.
Senator Moran. We will make sure that the letter is
provided to all of you.
Anyone else? In the minute that I have remaining, I raise
the topic that I raised with you in my office, and ask you
again about the issue of bots. The legislation that was
unanimously adopted designed to give our constituents access to
quality tickets at face value, it's going to require
enforcement, it's going to require, in my mind, someone being
made an example of. And I wonder if any of you have reviewed
the current actions of the FTC, have any suggestions about what
can and should be done to make certain that the BOTS Act is
enforced?
Ms. Wilson.
Ms. Wilson. I would say, Senator, that we are not yet privy
to any nonpublic information, but we will, I am sure, if
confirmed, agree on vigorously enforcing the law, following the
facts where they lead, and making sure that violators face
appropriate consequences.
Senator Moran. Part of the opportunity I have in asking you
questions today is to highlight at least this Senator's
emphasis or priorities. And so while you may not be able to
answer in detail the questions that I've asked you today, I
hope that you take them as something that at least one member
of this Committee thinks is valuable for you to pursue. And I
thank you for your willingness to pursue public service,
continue to pursue public service, and I look forward to your
confirmations.
Senator Capito. Senator Baldwin.
STATEMENT OF HON. TAMMY BALDWIN,
U.S. SENATOR FROM WISCONSIN
Senator Baldwin. Thank you, Madam Chair.
Thank you all for your time this morning and
congratulations on your nominations.
I know that you have already been asked and each of you
have answered questions relating to the Equifax breach as well
as the priority that ought to be placed on data breaches in
your work. I'm not going to re-ask those questions, but I want
to use my prerogative to tell you that that is also a high
priority of mine, and I was pleased to hear you all agree that
this ought to be a high priority of the FTC and yours, if
confirmed.
I want to begin by asking you about travel rating websites.
A number of my constituents and many other Americans have
fallen prey to a tainted alcohol problem in Mexico. This has
resulted in blackouts, reported robberies, sexual assaults, and
deaths, over 140 to date that have been identified by some
really excellent investigative journalism.
Mexican authorities have failed to address this issue. And
the current State Department protocol for warning American
travelers of these dangers is not working. In the alternative,
many victims have turned to travel rating websites, like
TripAdvisor, to report their experiences and to warn others who
might be traveling to those areas and resorts.
Unfortunately, it has been reported that TripAdvisor has
censored or taken down posts that detail these adverse
experiences at these types of Mexican resorts. These actions
are particularly concerning because TripAdvisor raises revenue
through click-based advertising and hotel transactions, and so
they might thus have an incentive to maximize positive reviews
and minimize negative reports.
In November, I wrote to the Federal Trade Commission urging
the agency to review these practices. I'd like to ask each of
you, will you commit to looking into this issue and the impacts
of the conduct of these types of websites on consumers if you
are confirmed?
And why don't I start with you, Mr. Simons.
Mr. Simons. Sure, Senator, I would be happy to.
Senator Baldwin. OK.
Ms. Wilson. Yes, I, too, would be happy to look into that,
Senator.
Mr. Phillips. Yes, Senator. It's scary enough to deal with
those issues in-country. I can't imagine how your constituents
must have felt in a foreign country dealing with those sorts of
things.
Mr. Chopra. Yes. And if I can add, there are many issues
we've seen over the past decade and beyond where there's a
clear mismatch in incentives between consumer and an
intermediary. We saw that firsthand in the mortgage crisis,
we've seen it in other markets, and you're right to raise it,
and my answer is yes.
Senator Baldwin. Thank you. In my minute remaining, Mr.
Chopra, I know that you have already been asked specifically
about the student debt relief scams by Senator Hassan. I want
to just add, given your professional history of advocating for
student borrowers, if you can talk a little bit more about the
coordination and how important it is for the FTC to coordinate,
for example, with the Department of Education and other
agencies to respond to and pursue these reprehensible actors.
Mr. Chopra. So there's no question that the FTC, the CFPB,
and the Education Department have to tackle this together,
along with state attorneys general. I would add, though, that
when deploying these resources, we need to not just look at the
symptom, but also the cause, and the cause of the proliferation
of these scams is often due to subpar student loan servicing
where borrowers are not given accurate information, they're
deceived along the way, and we have to correct those
fundamental problems. Otherwise, we will continue to see these
scams go on and on and on.
Senator Capito. Senator Tester.
STATEMENT OF HON. JON TESTER,
U.S. SENATOR FROM MONTANA
Senator Tester. Thank you, Madam Chair.
And I want to thank all of you for being here today. I
appreciate it. We talked a little bit about this, Mr. Simons,
when you were in my office yesterday I guess it was. But I want
to kind of get all four of your opinions on it. And what it's
about is concentration in the ag industry. And I know you guys
don't deal with all of it. I think Justice deals with the
commodities portion. But you do deal with fertilizer and
chemicals, the way I understand it. And just for your
reference, so you know, 80 percent of the beef in this country
is basically the market is controlled by four companies, 60
percent pork, 50 percent chicken, and that's not what I would
call very capitalistic in my book, and it makes me want to dig
Teddy Roosevelt up and bring him back to life.
But, nonetheless, I want to know from each one of you if
you think it's a problem, number one. And if you do think it's
a problem, what can be done about it, if anything? Is the
toothpaste out of the tube and we're just toast, or is this
something we can actually do something about?
So I'm going to start with you. John? Joe? Joseph?
[Laughter.]
Mr. Simons. Joe. Joe. Call me Joe.
Senator Tester. John is a good name, too, but Joe is good.
Mr. Simons. Yes, John is a really good name, too.
Senator Tester. Yes.
Mr. Simons. Exactly, yes.
Senator Tester. So just go ahead and shoot, and if you
think it's a problem, say, yes, and tell me what we can do
about it.
Mr. Simons. Well, so one of the things we talked about
earlier on in the hearing today is doing a merger retrospective
program to see if we have been too lax in our enforcement.
Senator Tester. Mm-hmm.
Mr. Simons. And so one of the areas we might focus on or
probably would focus on would be the ag area. So in terms--so
that----
Senator Tester. So if you find out you're too lax, does the
Syngenta-ChemChina situation, does it have some impacts on
that?
Mr. Simons. Yes, sure. Like any mergers that would come
ahead, you know, in the future would be subject to--or not
subject to, but would be--our analysis would be informed by the
merger retrospective.
Senator Tester. OK. But any mergers that's happened in the
past, that's a done deal?
Mr. Simons. Generally, that's generally the case.
Senator Tester. OK.
Mr. Simons. The other thing, too, is that not only could
the current situation be a result of a consolidation, it could
also be the result of anticompetitive unilateral practices, and
we could look at those, too, and that if there were such cases,
instances, of that, then what we would hopefully be able to do
is to get an injunction, prohibit those anticompetitive
practices, and maybe that would make the market more
competitive going forward.
Senator Tester. OK. Briefly, do you guys see it the same
way?
Go ahead.
Ms. Wilson. Yes, I do, Senator.
Senator Tester. OK.
Mr. Phillips. Yes, Senator.
Mr. Chopra. I would just add that the ability for people to
sustain a livelihood in agriculture, making sure there are no
illegal barriers to entry is critical.
Senator Tester. Yes. Well, I would just tell you, and we
talked about this a little bit, Joe, that my school, 40 kids in
my graduating class, which isn't very big, it has been a long
time ago now, 40 years ago, now the whole damn school has got
40 kids in it. And we've seen that kind of depopulation across
rural America.
Now I want to ask you about another issue. And, by the way,
I hope you're able to do that because I think when it comes to
competition in the marketplace, whether it's selling it or
whether it's the inputs you're putting on the crop, it is
critically important. It will do away with family farm
agriculture, and I'll tell you what, if family farm agriculture
goes away, this country changes, and not for the better. That's
just my two bits.
I was sitting in a Homeland Security meeting the other day,
it wasn't classified, and my phone rang, and I thought, gosh,
it's a 202 number, I better take it, and it was a telemarketer.
OK? And I guess I shouldn't have taken it, but it could have
been something important, and it wasn't, it was a nuisance. And
I think we have far too many of these, and we have failed in
this regard. So how can we stop this garbage from going on?
I've got to tell you, I mean, I don't ask them to call me, they
call me. If I want to buy a hotel room, I'll call them. OK? So
how do we stop this?
Mr. Simons. Yes, Senator. I think the original Do Not Call
rule was good at the initiation, but it has been overtaken by
technological developments, and it doesn't work anymore, as we
all experience. And so I think the answer is it's probably a
technological solution. And I know that the FTC and the FCC are
having conversations and working to explore that type of
solution.
Senator Tester. OK. Anybody else have any comments on that
about some great ideas so when I get calls, it's from somebody
that meant to call me and not just call a number?
Mr. Simons. Well, there are software solutions that are
effective to a certain degree. I haven't tried them myself----
Senator Tester. But I'm 61. That doesn't----
[Laughter.]
Mr. Simons. Yes, well, do you have children?
Senator Tester. Yes. I've got kids. My grandkids could
probably handle it.
Mr. Simons. Yes, there you go.
[Laughter.]
Senator Tester. Yes. Anybody else want to comment on the Do
Not Call stuff?
Mr. Phillips. Senator, I'll comment. I would associate
myself with what Mr. Simons said. There's no question that this
needs to be a priority for us.
Senator Tester. OK, good. Right behind the ag competition.
Mr. Phillips. Right behind that.
[Laughter.]
Senator Tester. OK. Thank you.
Mr. Chopra. It's a priority, but I'm worried about the
resources and tools to solve it. And I think if we need more,
we need to come to you and ask for it.
Senator Tester. Amen, brother. I mean, you guys have got a
job to do. If you don't have the dough to do it, we can't hold
you accountable. So please do.
Thank you all very much.
Thank you, Madam Chair.
Senator Capito. Thank you all very much. I think that
completes our first round. We're going to go to a brief second
round. I had one additional question, and then Senator
Blumenthal had several questions.
So mine is more of an education for me in terms of what
FTC's role would be. Senator Hassan mentioned the addictive
quality of computer gaming on the young minds. And my region of
the country has had enormous issues with opioid addiction and
the crisis that we see just cascading across the country.
So I guess my question, and I'm just sort of throwing this
out there, does the FTC have a role in seeing that addiction
is--which is considered a health issue--does addiction play
into decisions that the Commission could or would make around
certain products? And how do you see that? I don't know the
answer, I'm just asking.
So, Mr. Simons?
Mr. Simons. Yes, so thank you, Senator. So this goes back a
long way to dealing with the cigarette tobacco issues.
Basically, you're talking about a population that is put in a
very vulnerable situation where they potentially are misled
about the product that they are buying and using, and then you
have this addiction that attaches before they understand what's
happened. And so that's a serious issue and something that
sounds an unfairness.
Mr. Chopra. I would just add that addiction can lead to the
conditions for very serious scams and fraud. With respect to
opioids, you may know of some issues related to body brokering
where certain individuals receive kickbacks or payments to
refer addicts to specific rehabilitation facilities. There are,
of course, issues with the adequacy of rehabilitation
facilities and the representations they make to consumers. So
it implicates a number of our authorities, but to be
responsive, I don't believe addiction appears anywhere in the
statutes that the Commission enforces, but if I'm confirmed,
it's something that I know we'll need to tackle.
Senator Capito. Any other?
Mr. Phillips. Senator, I agree with my colleagues. The only
thing that I would add is addiction obviously creates fertile
ground for folks to proffer solutions to consumers that are not
really solutions, and that is an area that has long been a
concern for the FTC. If confirmed, I commit to you to
continuing that tradition, working with my colleagues and staff
to focus on it.
Senator Capito. Well, I appreciate that in terms of where
we're going with funding for treatment and other recovery
programs and other kinds of addiction issues particularly
around the opioid crisis. As we know, when you load a lot of
money into a program, it becomes more fertile ground for the
types of things that you were talking about. So thank you very
much.
Senator Blumenthal.
Senator Blumenthal. Thank you, Senator Capito, and thank
you for that last question, which I think raises a profoundly
important topic. You may or may not know, but as state attorney
general, I actually sued one of the major opioid manufacturers
in the country, it happens to be a Connecticut company, because
of, in effect, misleading or deceptive advertising. We led the
Federal Government in that effort. Eventually we were joined by
the Department of Justice, and the ``we'' was in fact
eventually state attorneys general who joined in my action.
There is still ongoing, in my view, misleading and
deceptive advertising surrounding powerful pain killers that
can lead to opioid addiction and death as well as lasting
damage to careers and lives and families. So I welcome your
receptiveness, and I hope to work with, as a matter of fact,
Senator Capito and you on ongoing solutions to this problem.
I want to come back to the bread and butter of the FTC, the
Ninth Circuit's decision in FTC v. AT&T Mobility. As all of you
know, by virtue of your legal training, this decision enables
companies to escape FTC authority and jurisdiction simply by
purchasing a minor side business. It creates a major gap in
your jurisdiction, ``your'' being the FTC's jurisdiction,
providing a common carrier service, even if it engages in all
kinds of unfair and deceptive practices with a gap regarding
the rest of its business. In effect, it means that Verizon, by
virtue of purchasing Yahoo!, Verizon being a common carrier,
Yahoo! being an edge provider, can simply escape enforcement of
privacy and all kinds of other policies.
So I would like your commitment that you will continue the
appeal of the Ninth Circuit's really misguided decision here. I
led an amicus brief in support of a rehearing, and I hope that
you will pursue an appeal vigorously to protect your
jurisdiction and protect consumers.
Mr. Simons.
Mr. Simons. Thank you, Senator. I fully expect that the
Ninth Circuit en banc is going to reverse the lower court. So
I'm very hopeful about that. And let me just say more generally
that I think it would be a great idea if we got rid of the
common carrier exception from the FTC Act entirely.
Senator Blumenthal. That was my next question, and I hope
all of the future Commissioners will agree on that point as
well as on the vigorous appeal of the Ninth Circuit's decision.
I'm assuming by your nodding that you agree.
Mr. Chopra. I would also add that bipartisan Commissions
over many years as well as the ABA Antitrust Section and others
have advocated for repeal of the common carrier exception, and
that seems like a good way to ensure there's a level playing
field.
Senator Blumenthal. I want to ask, speaking of bipartisan,
Mr. Simons, as the potential future Chair, you would agree,
would you not, that the Commission should consist of five
Commissioners, not just four, and that it should be bipartisan.
Do you agree?
Mr. Simons. I didn't turn my mic on. Yes, I agree, Senator.
Senator Blumenthal. Mobile cramming. As you know, the
unscrupulous practice of wireless carriers allowing third
parties to add charges onto monthly bills without authorization
by consumers, and in many cases, without consumers receiving
anything in return for those charges. The FTC has brought
numerous enforcement actions. The FCC has done as well. I hope
that all of you would commit to continuing that vigorous
enforcement. And again by the nodding, I will assume assent and
agreement.
I do want to ask a question about airlines. I understand
it's not within your jurisdiction, but I am emboldened to ask
this question actually by Senator Tester's reference to Teddy
Roosevelt. You are not only legal enforcers, you also have a
platform and a bully pulpit, and I hope that you will be
consumer advocates when it comes to this industry as well.
A number of years ago, I asked for the Department of
Justice to investigate potential collusion among the airlines
in pricing. The Department of Justice announced that it would
do so. We have yet to hear what the results, if any, are going
to be. But I think I am not overstating the sense of
frustration among many consumers by saying that they really
feel they need a bill of rights that is stronger than the legal
rights they have now, and partly it is the result of
consolidation and mergers within the industry. I have opposed
many, if not all, of them. And I would like your commitment
that you will take a vigorous and pro-consumer attitude toward
airline practices even though it is not in your jurisdiction.
Mr. Simons.
Mr. Simons. So, Senator, I'm a little reluctant to do that
just out of a courtesy to the people at the Antitrust Division.
I'm reluctant to do it particularly now because I would like to
have very good relationships with them and very good
coordination with them, and I really don't want to start off on
a bad foot.
Senator Blumenthal. Well, their jurisdiction is over
mergers and antitrust policies.
Mr. Simons. Yes.
Senator Blumenthal. Those mergers have already occurred----
Mr. Simons. Right.
Senator Blumenthal.--unfortunately, over objections from
consumer advocates who foresaw that consolidation, where I
think it's now 85 percent of the capacity, is concentrated in
four airlines. Ms. Wilson will correct me if I'm wrong on this
point. And by the way, this is not personal, I hope you
understand. I have great respect for Delta and its many, many
employees. And this is an industry issue. And I'm raising the
consumer issues because they are within your purview.
Mr. Simons. Well, if they're consumer issues within our
purview, then it's appropriate for us to speak about it.
Mr. Chopra. Senator, my understanding is that the
Transportation Department enforces laws with respect to unfair
and deceptive practices in air travel. That being said, I do
think there's a role for economists and researchers at the FTC,
particularly when doing cross-industry comparisons and
analyses, to show how certain types of actions taken by the
agencies and what their results were. Looking at those tools
and those models I think informs a lot of what both agencies
do, and vigorously communicating those results I think can be
very helpful to policymakers while still respecting the
jurisdictions of our other agencies.
Senator Blumenthal. Thank you.
Mr. Phillips, did you have----
Mr. Phillips. Just one more thing to add, Senator. We have
spoken a number of times in this hearing about our commitment
to work with other Federal agencies when they have expertise
over issues, and certainly that works both ways. If confirmed,
at the FTC, I plan to make us a resource to those agencies on
areas where we do have jurisdiction and do have expertise.
Senator Blumenthal. I appreciate that comment.
And, Mr. Chopra, I appreciate your comment as well as your
longstanding professional involvement in consumer advocacy,
which has been very impressive. But going beyond--and I'll just
finish on this point--the FTC being a resource, I'd also like
you to be a champion. I think there's a real opportunity here
for this new populism that we see sweeping the country to be
articulated and, in fact, enforced through your advocacy going
beyond your narrow legal jurisdiction. I understand it may not
be within that legal jurisdiction, but you have the bully
pulpit, you can bring the zeal and passion to consumer issues
that no one else will do at the Federal level. And I'll just
close with that hope. And I look forward to working with all of
you. Thank you.
And I understand that there's a statement from the
Congressional Antitrust Caucus that they wish to include. So
I'll ask that be included for the record.
Senator Capito. Without objection.
Senator Blumenthal. Thank you.
Senator Capito. Thank you.
[The information referred to follows:]
Prepared Statement of the Congressional Antitrust Caucus: Hon. Rick
Nolan, Co-Chair; Hon. Mark Pocan, Co-Chair; Hon. Ro Khanna, Co-Chair;
Hon. David N. Cicilline, Co-Chair; and Hon. Keith Ellison, Co-Chair
Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, distinguished members of the
Committee, thank you for the opportunity to submit a statement for the
record for today's hearing on the nominations of Mr. Joseph Simons, of
Virginia, Mr. Rohit Chopra of New York, Mr. Noah Joshua Phillips of
Maryland, and Ms. Christine S. Wilson of Virginia, to be Federal Trade
Commissioners.
In 1914, Congress established the Federal Trade Commission to
promote, develop, and protect antitrust law and competition policy.\1\
The Commission's independent, bipartisan structure and broad mandate to
police ``unfair methods of competition'' reflected Congress' distrust
of concentrated wealth, deep concern that existing law was inadequate
to address rising economic concentration, and common belief that
antitrust violations must be stopped before they gather momentum.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Humphrey's Ex'r v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 625-26 (1935)
(``[T]he language of the act, the legislative reports, and the general
purposes of the legislation as reflected by the debates, all combine to
demonstrate the congressional intent to create a body of experts who
shall gain experience by length of service; a body which shall be
independent of executive authority, except in its selection, and free
to exercise its judgment without the leave or hindrance of any other
official or any department of the government.'').

Cooperation, Control, and Competition, 71 Antitrust L. J. 74, 88

trade-commission-history/origins.pdf.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We established the Congressional Antitrust Caucus out of
recognition that this vision for preventing the concentration of
economic power and protecting economic opportunity must be restored.
For more than a century, Congress has routinely reformed and expanded
the antitrust laws to reverse ``a rising tide of economic concentration
in the American economy'' and to prevent the accumulation of economic
and political power.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Brown Shoe Co. v. United States, 370 U.S. 294, 315 (1962)
(``The dominant theme pervading congressional consideration of the 1950
amendments was a fear of what was considered to be a rising tide of
economic concentration in the American economy.''); Robert Pitofsky,
The Political Content of Antitrust, 127 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1051 (1979).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
But today, economic power, wealth, and opportunity are becoming
concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.\4\ There is mounting economic
evidence that an overall decline in antitrust enforcement over the past
several decades, coupled with wave after wave of mergers, has resulted
in high levels of concentration in numerous industries with clear
indicators of monopoly profits in key markets.\5\ The alarming result
of growing consolidation throughout the U.S. economy is increased costs
and fewer choices for consumers; wage stagnation and depression for
workers; reduced private investment, innovation, and small business
ownership, particularly among minorities; and diminished freedom and
political agency due to the outsized influence of large
corporations.\6\

We are in a monopoly moment. The Federal Trade Commission is on the
front lines of reversing this trend. It must have every tool and
resource necessary to reverse economic concentration and restore
economic opportunity. Working Americans, small business owners, and
innovators rely on the aggressive enforcement of the antitrust laws to
prevent monopolists from squeezing them out and imperiling the American
Dream.
It is noteworthy that Mr. Simons, who has been designated as the
incoming Chairman, agrees that the Commission must address concerns
that it has been ``too permissive in dealing with mergers and
acquisitions, resulting in harm to consumer welfare via increased
prices, limited consumer choice, and harm to workers.'' \7\ We look
forward to hearing how Mr. Simons plans to make this evaluation, what
his plans for fixing this failure will be, and how he will work to
improve the Commission's enforcement elsewhere. Most of all, we will
hold Mr. Simons to his word to ``determine the reason for such failure
and to fix it.'' \8\

We plan to continue our work to ensure that the Commission has the
tools and resources necessary to achieve its competition mission. With
these concerns in mind, we respectfully request that Members of the
Committee consider the following questions to the nominees:
1.
A large body of evidence suggests that lax merger enforcement has
resulted in high levels of concentrations in numerous
industries with clear indicators of monopoly profits in key
markets.\9\ In 2016, for example, the White House Council of
Economic Advisers found evidence of rising concentration in
specific industries and across sectors of the economy.
Professor John E. Kwoka of Northeastern University concluded
last year that ``broad changes in merger control policy at the
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division at the U.S.
Department of Justice have contributed to these outcomes.''
\10\ What do you believe are the causes of these trends, and
how should the Commission reverse them?

2.
Landmark cases like United States v. Microsoft underscore the
importance of effective monopolization enforcement in
protecting competition, consumers, and innovation. How should
the Commission reverse the decline in monopolization
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
enforcement in recent decades?
3.
Recent economic literature shows that anticompetitive behavior in
the market for employment--such as monopsony power to set
wages, collusion among employers, and the use of non-compete
clauses in employment contracts--have created barriers to
employment, mobility, and financial security for working
Americans. For example, the White House Council of Economic
Advisers reported in 2016 that limited competition among firms
providing employment is a significant contributing factor to
wage depression.\11\ That same year, the antitrust agencies
issued joint guidance for human resource professionals to
promote competitive employment markets, which benefit employees
``through higher wages, better benefits, or other terms of
employment.'' \12\ In your view, how may the Commission build
on this record to protect workers?

4.
A growing number of international competition authorities have
expressed concern that the concentrated control of consumers'
data may harm competition, innovation, and undermine consumers'
privacy online and offline. What is your view of the role of
data in antitrust enforcement? Do you believe that incumbent
firms with access to large swaths of consumer data discourage

Senator Capito. Well, given our hope to place these
nominees on the Committee's next markup, the hearing record
will remain open until Tuesday, February 20. During this time,
Senators are asked to submit any questions for the record. Upon
receipt, the witnesses are requested to submit their written
answers to the Committee as soon as possible, but by no later
than Monday, February 26.
So with that, I would like to thank the witnesses for not
just your dedication to public service, but your very open and
honest answers. I think we all have a great deal of confidence
that has been expressed both with you and I think here in terms
of the Committee.
So with that, I would say this hearing is now adjourned.

Re: Nomination of Joseph J. Simons as Chairman of the Federal Trade
Commission
Dear Senators Thune and Nelson:
We write, in our individual capacities, as former Chairs (as well
as the current Chair) of the Section of Antitrust Law of the American
Bar Association. The Section is the largest and best known global
organization of lawyers devoted to competition and consumer protection
issues, and we have long been a leading proponent of the importance of
competition and consumer protection enforcement to our free economy. We
write today, irrespective of party affiliation, in support of the
nomination of Joseph J. Simons to be the next Chairman of the Federal
Trade Commission. Mr. Simons has demonstrated an extraordinarily deep
understanding of the most important competition principles throughout
his career, enhanced by his commitment to sound enforcement during his
years in public service. We are convinced that he will be an
outstanding Chairman of the Federal Trade Commission.
Mr. Simons's record includes extensive scholarly work. His paper,
co-authored with economist Barry Harris, entitled Focusing Market
Definition: How Much Substitution is Necessary? 12 J. RES. L. & ECON.
207 (1989), introduced the concept of ``critical loss,'' which has been
central to merger analysis ever since. His many other publications and
public presentations further confirm his status as a real scholar. But
Mr. Simons also has strong practical understanding and capabilities, as
he has demonstrated in handling many significant matters in his years
in private practice. He even served, on nomination by the Justice
Department, as the trustee of four wireless telephone businesses
relating to the GTE/Bell Atlantic/Vodafone transaction.
Mr. Simons's public service at the Federal Trade Commission
deserves special mention. He started at the FTC's Bureau of Competition
in the late 1980s as Associate Director for Mergers and then Assistant
Director for Evaluation. In these positions, he supervised a number of
significant merger and non-merger matters. He returned to the FTC from
June 2001 until August 2003 as Director of the Bureau of Competition
under Chairman Timothy Muris. There, his accomplishments were truly
notable:
v
Bringing significant cases challenging unilateral conduct as
unfair methods of competition in standard setting.
v
Taking to trial the first reverse payments case, and aggressively
pursuing the FTC's ultimately successful campaign to limit the
use of reverse payments.
v
Pursuing litigation and advocacy to prevent companies from harming
competition by abusing litigation.
v
Challenging restraints on competition that had taken advantage of
unjustified state action immunity.
v
Commencing a retrospective on hospital mergers and reviving the
FTC's efforts to prevent anticompetitive hospital mergers
despite years of losses under prior administrations.
v
Bringing a case in the recorded music industry that resulted in an
important ruling for the FTC on horizontal restraints in the
Court of Appeals.
v
Very importantly, insisting on rigorous economic analysis in all
antitrust investigations.
v
And, significantly, managing a large staff effectively,
maintaining excellent morale, and implementing competition
policy in a nonpartisan manner.
For all these reasons and more, we all support the nomination of
Mr. Simons. We do so based on his demonstrated excellence in
understanding the law and economics of competition and consumer
protection issues; his practical experience in representing important
businesses; and his truly outstanding record in public service. We urge
the Committee and the full Senate to approve his confirmation at the
earliest opportunity.

Re: Nomination Hearing for Federal Trade Commissioners (February 14,
2018)
Dear Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson:
Thank you for the opportunity to submit evidence into the record as
part of the Committee's consideration of the Federal Trade Commissioner
nominees.
The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) represents the public
affairs needs of companies that publish computer and video games in the
United States for game consoles, handheld devices, personal computers,
and the Internet. While our industry is well known for entertainment
products that bring joy to millions of consumers, researchers have
begun to tout the educational, mental health, and rehabilitative
benefits that video games produce.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) plays an important role in
promoting consumer protection and has, on several occasions, lauded our
industry's self-regulatory practices. These efforts date back to 1994,
when our industry founded the Entertainment Software Rating Board
(ESRB) to provide consumers--especially parents--with critical ratings
information to guide purchasing decisions. When concerns about media
marketing practices to children arose not long thereafter, the FTC
conducted a series of regulatory reviews, spanning from 2000 to 2013.
Having conducted eight such reviews, the FTC repeatedly reported that
the ESRB ''continues to have the strongest self-regulatory code'' among
the film, music, and video game industries.\2\ The ESRB has since
expanded its ratings program from physical products to digital games
and mobile apps.\3\ Among other things, the ESRB rating disclosures for
digital games indicate whether a game includes the ability to identify
a user's location, enables user-to-user communications, provides
unrestricted Internet access, or allows digital goods to be
purchased.\4\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
During the questioning of the FTC nominees at the February 14
hearing, Senator Maggie Hassan raised concerns over the continued
efficacy of the industry's self-regulatory efforts. Relying in part on
a proposal by the World Health Organization (WHO) to adopt ''gaming
disorder'' as a diagnosable disorder,\5\ Senator Hassan maintained that
in-game purchases, including so-called ``loot boxes,'' might lead to
addictive behavior by children.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ It is worth noting that the WHO has not yet adopted ``gaming
disorder'' as classification in its update to the International
Classification of Diseases (ICD-11), which was recently released as a
beta draft. See World Health Organization, ``Gaming Disorder'' (Jan.
2018), available at: http://www.who.int/features/qa/gaming-disorder/
en/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Putting aside the fact that the WHO's proposed classification does
not address in-game purchases, we would respectfully suggest that the
significant weight of scientific evidence does not support the claim
that video game play leads to addiction. In 2013, for example, the
American Psychiatric Association (APA) declined to include a diagnosis
for ``gaming disorder'' in its Diagnoshc and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders,\6\ concluding that there was insufficient evidence to
classify any level of video game play as a formal disorder. To date,
the APA has not changed its determination. Furthermore, in 2016, a
group of academic researchers criticized the WHO proposal for a lack of
consensus of the symptoms that might lead to such a diagnosis and
worried that it might stigmatize ordinary game play, leading to
unwarranted public policy changes.\7\ More recent ly, thirty-six
academic researchers warned against labeling video game play as
addictive, ``given the gravity of diagnostic classification and its
wider societal impact . . . and the low quality of the existing
evidence base.'' Instead, these experts urged the medical community to
focus on treating the ``underlying issues such as depressive mood or
social anxiety first.'' \8\

Our industry takes seriously its responsibility to keep consumers
informed with comprehensive and essential ratings information and
continually works to ensure that its practices meet consumer needs and
expectations. We stand ready to work with this Committee to provide any
additional information it might find helpful on this issue.

Hon. John Thune,
Chairman,
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
United States Senate,
Washington, DC.
Hon. Bill Nelson,
Ranking Member,
Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation,
United States Senate,
Washington, DC.
Dear Chairman Thune, Ranking Member Nelson, and Honorable Members of
the Committee:
I am writing to you on behalf of the members of the American
Coatings Association (ACA) and the more than 250,000 employees in the
paint and coatings industry, to urge your swift confirmation of the
President's four nominees to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC): Mr.
Joseph Simons, Mr. Rohit Chopra, Mr. Noah Joshua Phillips, and Ms.
Christine S. Wilson.
For some time now, the FTC has been operating with only two
commissioners and this has severely hampered the agency's ability to
carry out its work. These unprecedented vacancies have created
obstacles to the ability of the agency to protect consumers from
anticompetitive, deceptive, and unfair business practices while unduly
burdening legitimate business activity. ACA has worked closely in the
past with the Federal Trade Commission on developing industry-wide
guidelines for the ever-evolving issues that impact our industry;
however, more recently, the agency has moved away from the adoption of
consistent industry-wide standards in favor of a case-by-case approach.
It is clear to us that industry-wide guidelines provide certainty to
industry members and are the most effective in protecting consumers
from deceptive and unfair business practices. ACA believes that the
agency will be better equipped to fulfill its mission of protecting
consumers without unduly burdening legitimate business activity with a
full slate of commissioners.
It is for these reasons that ACA asks you to move forward swiftly
with the approval of these nominees so that the FTC can get back to
working on the important issues necessary to preserve a fair
marketplace, for which they are charged.
If you have any questions at all, please do not hesitate to contact
me directly.
Best regards,
Heidi K. McAuliffe,
Vice President, Government Affairs.

Statement for the Record
Jewelers of America is the national trade association for
retailers, manufacturers, and suppliers serving the fine jewelry
marketplace, with over 3,000 member firms representing over 50,000
employees. Because almost all materials used to create finished jewelry
products arrive at a U.S. manufacturer in rough and raw form,
significant work is required by U.S. manufacturers to make saleable
finished jewelry products. Under existing FTC standards, the point of
origin of materials needed to manufacture a piece of jewelry is the
only consideration when determining whether or not that piece of
jewelry can be labeled ``Made in the USA.''
Question for the Record
In determining whether jewelry manufactured in the U.S. can be
labeled ``Made in the USA,'' the FTC uses the ``All or Virtually All''
standard. This standard is based solely on the point of origin of
materials used in the jewelry. However, U.S. Customs and Border
Protection uses the ``Substantial Transformation'' standard to make the
same labeling determination, which is the standard used by other U.S.
Federal agencies and foreign government agencies. Accordingly, if a
jewelry firm in Massachusetts manufactures a piece of gold jewelry for
a customer outside of the U.S., it must be labeled ``Made in the USA''
in all export and U.S. Customs documentation. This labeling requirement
has international tax implications as well. An identical piece of gold
jewelry shipped by the same U.S. manufacturer to a U.S. customer cannot
be labeled ``Made in the USA'' based on FTC standards.
What is the FTC's justification for imposing a standard on the U.S.
jewelry industry that conflicts with standards used by other U.S.
Federal agencies?

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune to
Joseph Simons
Question 1. There are a growing number of voices calling for
responsible Federal Trade Commission (FTC) reforms, including those
detailed in the transition report of the American Bar Association. How
do you view the following proposed reforms:
Answer. While the FTC must couple its Civil Investigative Demands
(CIDs) with ``resolutions'' describing the investigation, the FTC has
made a practice of issuing general, non-specific resolutions that some
view as too vague to justify its CIDs. This can lead to overly broad
investigations that lack focus and increase costs and burdens on
business. What are your views on adopting a more targeted use of CIDs?
Answer. I am in favor of issuing resolutions that describe the
investigation in as specific terms as are reasonably practical at the
time of issuance.
Question 1a. CIDs also require approval from only one Commissioner.
What are your views on the FTC ensuring that all Commissioners are
notified before a CID is issued, so that the Commissioners can raise
objections or otherwise act as a check in the process?
Answer. This suggestion is certainly worth considering, but does
carry with it the possibility, or even likelihood, of substantially
delaying investigations, which would need to be avoided.
Question 1b. The FTC can avoid the formality of obtaining a CID in
a non-merger matter by issuing ``Access Letters'' to companies instead,
which are often substantially similar to CIDs in composition and
burden. While these are ``voluntary'' requests for information,
companies typically feel compelled to comply. What are your views on
the FTC's use of ``Access Letters'' as a means of avoiding issuance of
a CID for non-merger investigations?
Answer. Access Letters can be a useful tool when used in the
correct way. They should be generally used to obtain preliminary
information useful to a determination of whether fuller investigation
is appropriate. This approach can involve a lower burden on both FTC
staff and the parties, and can be more efficient.
Question 1c. Although the issuance of the CID is confidential, a
company seeking to quash or modify a CID must do so publicly. This
exposes the existence of the investigation, potentially leading to
public scrutiny. Thus, companies may avoid challenging CIDs they view
as unfair to avoid the possible reputational harm associated with
publicizing an investigation. What are your views on a company's
ability to seek to quash or modify a CID without such petitions being
made immediately public?
Answer. This is a suggestion I am willing to explore, if confirmed.
Question 1d. The FTC has been criticized for seeking permanent
injunctions in its consent decrees without demonstrating a ``cognizable
danger of recurring violation.'' What are your views on the FTC
obtaining permanent injunctions only where it can show ``some
cognizable danger of recurring violation''?
Answer. I understand the concern. But since the question here is
limited to matters settled by consent, the situations involved are all
negotiated agreements, and thus there would be no opportunity to make
any kind of formal showing of the type suggested. However, the
Commission must always be mindful that the remedy it agrees to in a
consent order is appropriate.
Question 1e. What are your views on the FTC adopting a more fact-
specific and tailored approach to the standard length of 20 years for
consent decrees?
Answer. If confirmed, I would like to consult with the career staff
at the Commission as well as the other commissioners before coming to a
view on this issue.
Question 1f. What are your views on instituting a process to
expedite reconsideration of consent decrees older than 10 years?
Answer. I would be open to instituting such a process, but would
like to confer with the staff at the Commission and my fellow
commissioners.
Question 1g. What are your views on the FTC's Bureau of Economics
issuing routine public statements providing a highlevel description of
its economic analysis and rationale for consumer protection enforcement
actions?
Answer. Public transparency regarding the methods used by the FTC
is always helpful, but I believe the better approach is for the
Commission itself to issue as much guidance as reasonably possible,
which would combine inputs from both the Bureau of Economics and the
Bureau of Consumer Protection.
Question 2. Regardless of your answers to the above questions,
would you support the FTC conducting a workshop with stakeholders to
examine these and perhaps other potential reforms that results in a
report with recommendations for action?
Answer. Yes, I would support a workshop on at least some and
perhaps all of these issues.
Question 3. Where a merging party has filed for merger review under
Hart-Scott-Rodino and has been unable to come to terms with the FTC,
what are your views on the FTC voluntarily foregoing seeking a
preliminary injunction and instead working with the merger parties to
combine a preliminary injunction with a permanent injunction in Federal
Court as has been recommended by the bipartisan Antitrust Modernization
Commission?
Answer. This sounds like a worthwhile approach, and if confirmed, I
would be interested in examining it further.
Question 4. Given the proliferation of competition enforcers in the
world today and the fact that data privacy laws are actively being
revised and enforced in foreign countries, what role should the FTC
play in relation to its counterparts in foreign jurisdictions?
Additionally, what are your views on how the FTC can be a better
proponent for the U.S. approach to antitrust and privacy in foreign
jurisdictions?
Answer. The FTC has for many years worked in close partnership with
the Department of Justice Antitrust Division in advocating for sound
competition enforcement around the globe, and the FTC itself has been
very active in international settings promoting strong but sensible
privacy policies. Given the growing presence and significance of
foreign authorities in these areas, such advocacy becomes even more
important over time. The best tool here is constant and constructive
engagement with foreign authorities, including partnering with other
like-minded foreign authorities to emphasize the benefits of such an
approach.
______
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Roger F. Wicker to
Joseph Simons
Question 1. To the best of your knowledge, please describe the
FTC's ongoing activities related to identifying counterfeit lenses
produced by Asian manufacturers.
Answer. I do not have access to non-public investigations that may
be ongoing at the FTC, and I am not aware of any public investigations.
But I am aware the Department of Justice has obtained a plea agreement
from the owner of Candy Color Lenses, who was sentenced to significant
jail time. This DOJ investigation is part of Operation Double Vision, a
multiagency effort including FDA, U.S. Postal Inspection Service, and
U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
Question 2. To the best of your knowledge, please describe the
FTC's interactions with the FDA related to post-market surveillance of
contact lenses.
Answer. Although FTC does coordinate with FDA on a variety of
issues, I am not aware of FTC interacting with FDA on post-market
surveillance of contact lenses.
Question 3. To the best of your knowledge, what percentage of
contact lens wearers in the United States have filed complaints with
the FTC?
Answer. I am not aware of what percentage of contact lens wearers
in the U.S. have filed complaints with the FTC.
Question 4. What other Class III medical devices does the FTC
regulate through specific rules (i.e., pacemakers, implants, etc)?
Answer. I am not aware of any.
Question 5. Many online companies are engaging in targeted
advertising. Using consumer data, companies can target what they deem
to be the most relevant ads to consumers. Should there be more
transparency into how the algorithms behind targeted advertising work
so that consumers can see how they are being targeted for certain
messages?
Answer. I would be happy to look into this issue if confirmed.
Question 6. Would third party audits of algorithms be a reasonable
way to ensure the algorithms are doing what companies claim and not
harming competition or consumer choice? Is this something the FTC might
consider looking into?
Answer. I would be willing to consider looking into this issue if
confirmed.
Question 7. In 2007, when asked about monitoring domination in the
advertising intermediation market and its impact on competitiveness,
the FTC indicated that it would ``carefully review'' any attempts to
manipulate products to any one entity's advantage. However, a decade
later we are seeing platform dominance that is allowing a single entity
to shape what products consumers see--and by that matter--access. This
may be a problem for consumers looking for short-term loans online. If
confirmed, under your leadership, what would the FTC do to ensure
consumer choice in the online lending markets?
Answer. The FTC enjoys broad authority to protect consumers from
unfair or deceptive acts or practices, as well as to protect markets
from unfair methods of competition. The goal of both is to assure that
consumers are treated fairly, and enjoy as much choice as freely
competitive markets can provide. If confirmed, I will confer with staff
and fellow commissioners regarding online markets, including platform
dominance in order to get a sense for what needs to be done to keep
these markets free and fair.
Question 8. The Federal Trade Commission routinely reviews mergers
between companies across a host of industries to help make sure that
they do not adversely affect competition. This process can result in
the Commission blocking a merger or approving it only if the parties
agree to certain remedies to mitigate any potential anti-competitive
effects. In this process, the Commission has the authority to pursue
legal options to enforce a ruling, including administrative proceedings
or pursuing an injunction in Federal court.
I understand that for years standard practice was for the FTC to
file for an injunction in addition to commencing an administrative
proceeding under so-called ``Part 3'' of the FTC Act so that the party
proposing the merger would have an early ``day in court'' the same way
that it would if the merger investigation had been undertaken by the
Department of Justice. I am aware of at least one case recently where
this did not happen.
If confirmed and a merger were to come up for a vote during your
tenure and the majority of Commissioners decided the merger shouldn't
proceed (at least not without remedies), would you commit to making
sure that the FTC files for an injunction in Federal court, to make
sure that the parties have the same chance to defend the merits of the
deal in court as they would if the merger had been reviewed by the
Department of Justice?
Answer. It is important that as a nominee, and potential
Commissioner, I do not prejudge any case or party, but I am happy to
discuss the issue of merger enforcement generally. There are benefits
to the Commission's administrative litigation path, including providing
the Commission an opportunity to develop important questions of law.
That being said, it should be used on the merits, and not to the
disadvantage of any party, such as running out the clock. For example,
if the FTC is denied a preliminary injunction in a merger matter, I do
not believe the Commission should pursue that matter in administrative
litigation.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Roy Blunt to
Joseph Simons
Question 1. How does your experience in antitrust prepare you to
lead the FTC in determining cases related to data protection and
privacy?
Answer. I know the agency very well from two previous stints with
the Commission, when I developed a reputation as a vigorous enforcer. I
have every intention of maintaining that reputation with respect to
both the FTC's competition and consumer protection missions. If
confirmed, I will work diligently with the outstanding staff at the FTC
to make sure the Commission continues to aggressively protect consumers
from deceptive or unfair acts or practices, including with respect to
privacy and data security.
Question 2. Do you have any recommendations for stakeholders
involved in the data breach debate that may help both industry and
government entities find common ground on solutions?
Answer. The FTC has a long tradition of inviting contribution and
comment from stakeholders across industry, both inside and outside of
government, when tackling the most difficult challenges confronting the
agency. If confirmed, I will encourage all interested stakeholders to
continue to participate and engage with the FTC as we study these
issues and develop an enforcement agenda.

Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Jerry Moran to
Joseph Simons
Question. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) brought an enforcement
action in July 2014 against a secondary market ticket provider and some
of its ``private label'' partners. In this particular case, the FTC
found that the ``private label'' partners were misleading consumers to
believe that they were actually buying tickets directly from the venue
and directed the private labels to engage in more disclosure. In other
words, the FTC was not troubled by the development of the ``private
label'' markets, but instead with the deceptive acts of the private
labels in this particular case. Do you read this case in the same way?
Answer. As online markets continue to develop, the emergence of
private labels, in and of itself, is not necessarily problematic. We
have seen such private label arrangements in many industries for some
time. However, to the extent that these private labels engage in
deceptive or unfair conduct, I will commit to pursuing enforcement to
protect consumers and ensure the integrity of online markets.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to

Question 1. As a former Attorney General of Alaska, I always
appreciated coordination with Federal agencies where appropriate, and
the opportunity to communicate solutions that made the most sense for
Alaskans. Given the importance of state attorneys general to the FTC's
antitrust enforcement, please describe your views on the working
relationship between the FTC and state attorneys general.
Answer. A strong working relationship between the FTC and state
attorneys general is critical to the FTC's ability to most efficiently
and effectively fulfill its mission.
Question 2. As you know, the state I represent is unique which
means its problems are unique and require unconventional solutions. In
a highly rural state like Alaska, many communities are not connected by
roads, challenging weather conditions prohibit timely delivery of mail
and other essential services, and quality connectivity is considered a
luxury. One of your objectives at the Commission is consumer protection
and education. How will you ensure that rural constituents like mine
have the tools they need to make informed decisions and in cases of
abuse that require follow up, for example data breaches or identity
theft, the information necessary to mitigate risks and resolve the
issue?
Answer. The FTC has long committed itself to consumer education and
engagement. I absolutely appreciate that this becomes more difficult
for citizens in rural areas, and if confirmed, I will confer with
staff, including those posted in our regional offices, and take a hard
look at how the agency can assure that consumers of all regions and
ways of life have access to the tools the FTC provides.
Question 3. In your prepared statement, you discuss anticompetitive
consolidation, which immediately called to mind the enormous market
capitalization of tech companies. Recent calculations value the four
largest tech companies' capitalization at $2.8 trillion, which is a
staggering 24 percent of the S&P 500 Top 50, close to the value of
every stock traded on the Nasdaq in 2001, and to give a different
perspective, approximately the same amount as France's current GDP.
Press reports have also noted allegations of increased anti-competitive
behavior by some of these companies. Is there a point at which these
companies are simply too big from an antitrust standpoint?
Answer. Under the antitrust laws, big is neither necessarily bad,
nor necessarily good. It can be good, it can be bad, and it can be both
at the same time. Often, big companies get big by producing good
products or services at low prices. If that is the case, the FTC should
not interfere. If, however, companies get big--or, just as importantly,
stay big--through anticompetitive conduct, then the FTC should
intervene to stop such conduct and protect competition and consumer
welfare.
Question 4. As Chairman, is there a former FTC Chairman that you
admire and believe set forth the right vision and policies at the FTC?
Who and why?
Answer. I have had the great fortune to learn from two former FTC
Chairmen, Bob Pitofsky and Tim Muris. As a law student, I studied with
Chairman Pitofsky at Georgetown University Law Center, played
basketball with him in the weekly student faculty basketball games, and
of course, observed his work as Chairman from outside the agency. With
respect to Chairman Muris, I observed him from inside the agency as his
Director of the Bureau of Competition. Both men exemplified the best of
what an FTC Chairman should be--they demonstrated commitment to the
agency's mission, the highest degree of skill in the law, and unmatched
knowledge of how to successfully run the Commission. Each had his own
approaches and priorities, but each approach was bipartisan at the
core, required active, vigorous enforcement, and the maintenance of
high staff morale.

Question. When Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act in 2003, it was a pro-consumer measure that ensured
consumers automatically receive a copy of his or her prescription after
an eye exam--without having to ask for it, pay an additional fee, or
sign a waiver. Do you agree that consumers should receive copies of
their prescriptions as Congress intended so that they can use the
prescription to purchase their contact lenses from a source of their
choosing?
Answer. Yes.
______
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Jim Inhofe to
Joseph Simons
Question 1. The Federal Trade Commission routinely reviews mergers
between companies across a host of industries to determine any
antitrust implications. This process can result in the Commission
requiring certain remedies to mitigate any impacts the Commission
believes the merger would have on competition in the marketplace.
Furthermore, should the Commission deny a merger, the Commission has
the authority to pursue legal options to enforce a ruling, including
administrative and Federal district court proceedings. Legal
proceedings, even when necessary, are costly, for both the Commission
and the companies involved and can drag on for an extended period of
time. Lengthy legal proceedings create uncertainty for the companies
involved and in some cases result in a merger being blocked not on its
individual merits but because the clock ran out on the proposed merger.
As a Commissioner, you will have a role in determining any and all
potential legal proceedings that would result from a decision by the
Commission. Do you believe that legal proceedings should focus on the
merits of the matter before the Commission?
Answer. Yes.
Question 2. Furthermore, what policies or procedures do you believe
the Commission can implement to ensure legal proceedings focus on the
merits of the matter and are not used to ``run out the clock'' on a
merger?
Answer. If the Director of the Bureau of Competition is properly
supervising the career staff, this should not happen. And in any event,
the Chairman should ensure that running out the clock does not occur.
If confirmed, I will make sure this does not happen, and would
encourage parties to notify me if they believe it is occuring.
Question 3. If a party to a matter before the Commission believes
legal proceedings are being used to ``run out the clock'' on a merger,
what remedies can be used by that party to address this issue?
Answer. First, notify the Director of the Bureau of Competition,
and if not successful, the Chairman.
Question 4. In a more general sense, how can the FTC work to ensure
its merger reviews are resolved in a timely manner and that its merger
investigation process takes into consideration both short and long term
impacts to industries and consumers?
Answer. If confirmed, I intend to conduct a review of the merger
investigation process. Merger investigations are now averaging close to
12 months, up from 6 months or so just a half-decade ago. The
Commission should reform the process to push back the length of
investigations closer to the six month level. The current status is bad
for competition, bad for the acquired company and bad for the FTC. It
keeps target companies in limbo for too long, increasing uncertainty
and causing loss of customers and employees--both of which are bad for
competition. With respect to the FTC itself, the current length of
investigations essentially dilutes the Commission's resources. If time
for investigations were reduced to six months, the Commission would be
able to handle roughly twice as many merger investigations or use the
freed-up resources for more non-merger enforcement.
Question 5. The Federal Trade Commission plays a key role in
investigating consumer complaints and has a number of tools at its
disposal to promote fair competition in the market place. These tools
range from educational efforts to imposing overly burdensome rules.
When considering how to respond to consumer complaints, do you
believe the Commission has the guidelines or internal metrics necessary
to determine an acceptable threshold for the increased costs associated
with its rule makings or other remedial actions?
Answer. Yes. The FTC has a large staff of Ph.D. economists capable
of economic analysis along these lines.
Question 6. Should the Commission be required to consider less
burdensome alternative options in certain circumstances, such as when
the total number of complaints is a very small percentage of business
transactions?
Answer. In general, the Commission should strive to minimize
burdens to the extent this does not materially diminish its enforcement
efforts. While the agency should focus its enforcement resources on
matters involving substantial harm to competition and consumers, the
number of complaints is not always a useful metric in determining
whether unfair or deceptive acts or practices are occurring.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Bill Nelson to
Joseph Simons
Question 1. The FTC is a relatively small agency that has to
effectively use its resources to cover a very broad jurisdiction. In
this regard, as a matter of discretion, it may be wise for the FTC to
pursue enforcement cases involving practices that result in substantial
harm. However, substantial harm is not a legal requirement under
section five of the FTC Act--cases involving deception do not require
harm at all, and cases involving unfairness can involve harm that is
prospective and/or non-financial. Consequently, it is very important
that commissioners do not stringently require types of harm as a legal
test for agency enforcement actions. This principle is particularly
important because Lab MD is challenging the FTC's legal authority to
bring enforcement actions for data breaches based on the lack of
requisite harm. As a commissioner, will you pledge to not require
substantial harm or financial harm as legal tests for FTC enforcement
actions?
Answer. If confirmed, I commit to pursue bipartisan efforts to
bring enforcement actions for both unfair or deceptive acts or
practices. I anticipate that actionable harms will include financial
harms, as well as non-financial ones, and look forward to working with
fellow commissioners to further define the outer parameters of what
constitutes harm under the FTC Act, including for data breaches.
Question 2. The FTC's Bureau of Economics provides valuable insight
and analysis that supplements the FTC's work. However, the FTC is,
first and foremost, a law enforcement agency, not a regulatory agency.
As such, economic analysis should play a complementary role, not a
dispositive one. The FTC should enforce the FTC Act and the other laws
under its jurisdiction according to legal doctrine, not economic
analyses. As a commissioner, will you pledge to continue to further the
FTC as a law enforcement agency in which the Bureau of Economics and
economic analyses play a complimentary role, not a dispositive role?
Will you pledge to enforce the law according to legal precedent?
Answer. If confirmed, I commit that under my leadership the FTC
will enforce the FTC Act as written and according to legal precedent.
The FTC has a rich bipartisan tradition of including economic analysis
as an important part of both competition and consumer protection
matters, and I plan to use it to support vigorous enforcement in
pursuit of both missions.
Question 3. Piracy continues to be a problem that plagues content
providers. The Internet is filled with websites that provide pirated
content and entertainment at the expense of the companies that produce
the content. Moreover, many of these websites can harm consumers with
unsafe or even fraudulent data and commercial practices. What can the
FTC do to crack down on the illegal piracy of American entertainment
and content?
Answer. There are several things the FTC can do. First, it can
energetically enforce all laws that Congress has passed in order to
address these concerns, including actions against spyware and malware
offenses that often attend pirated material. Further, it can and must
work with each of the many other Federal agencies empowered to police
unsafe and fraudulent data and commercial practices. Additionally, the
FTC can continue its long and successful tradition of business and
consumer education and guidance, as well as policy advocacy, such as
with workshops and resources provided through the FTC website.
Question 4. Fraudulent websites can deceive consumers by
masquerading as legitimate hotel websites. Consumers who are fooled by
these sites reserve rooms that do not exist or turn out to be different
from what they reserved online. According to industry statistics, this
particular fraud affects millions of consumers a year and costs the
hotel industry hundreds of millions of dollars. I wrote former FTC
Chairwoman Edith Ramirez about this issue in June 2015. Will you pledge
to ensure that the FTC will work with other law enforcement entities
(such as state attorneys general) to bring enforcement actions against
fraudulent hotel websites?
Answer. Yes.

Question. I was a cosponsor of the Better Online Ticket Sales
(BOTS) Act that prohibits ticket scalpers from using bots and other
online measures to deliberately circumvent security protocols that

bots.
Mr. Simons, will you commit to looking at this issue and pursuing
enforcement actions against bot users?

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Richard Blumenthal to
Joseph Simons
Question 1. What experience do you have working with State
Attorneys General? What are your views regarding the Commission working
with state law enforcement?
Answer. During my tenure as Director of the Bureau of Competition,
the bureau worked closely with the states in merger and non-merger
investigations. I intend to have the Commission continue that close
working relationship between the states and the Commission's
enforcement and policy bureaus.
Question 2. In the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, Congress gave the FTC
extensive authority over the sale, servicing, and leasing of
automobiles--charging it to protect consumers from abusive auto lending
practices and granting it exclusive authority to draft rules governing
unfair or deceptive acts or practices by automobile dealers.
Would you support the FTC using its rulemaking authority to rein in
unfair or deceptive acts or practices by automobile dealers?
Answer. My general preference is to emphasize law enforcement
actions against unfair or deceptive acts or practices, rather than
enact rules that may be difficult and time-consuming to adopt, and
which may at times inadvertently chill procompetitive or efficient
conduct. However, I can commit to discussing with my fellow
commissioners and FTC staff whether, in light of the FTC's experience
and knowledge, the Commission should exercise its rulemaking authority
or whether an increase in the Commission's law enforcement efforts are
necessary and advisable.
Question 3. More than 17 million Americans are the victims of
identity theft every year. This problem seems to increase year over
year as identity theft scams seem to get more sophisticated. Three
years ago, the FTC established IdentityTheft.gov. This site is supposed
to be a one-stop shop for victims of identity theft where they can
easily freeze credit across the big three credit reporting agencies,
and recover their stolen identities.
This website's functionality is limited, however, because of what
appears to be a lack of engagement by the credit bureaus to make the
site what it should be.
How would you engage with credit bureaus to ensure
IdentityTheft.gov has a comprehensive suite of easy to use tools
allowing victims of identity theft to recover as quickly as possible,
with as little stress as possible? What are your expectations with
respect to the role the credit reporting agencies should play in making
IdentityTheft.gov an effective one-stop shop for identity theft
victims?
Answer. Protecting consumers from identity theft is crucial. I am
not yet fully briefed on the limitations you note, but I will consult
with the FTC's enforcement and technology staff to determine what
improvements to IdentityTheft.gov are necessary. I expect that the
active participation of all stakeholders--including reporting
agencies--will be important, and thus I will confer with staff and my
fellow commissioners about how we can continue with a collaborative
approach to preventing and remedying identity theft into the future.
Question 4. Would you support FTC's jurisdiction be expanded to
include non-profits and charities so that it can act more swiftly to
prevent and stop illegal conduct in the nonprofit sector?
Answer. Yes.
Question 5. Other Federal agencies charged with consumer protection
make an array of data available on consumer complaints received. The
FTC releases relatively very little data on companies receiving
significant levels of complaints. Do you think the FTC should be more
transparent about the complaints it receives?
Answer. I think it is important that the Commission be as
transparent as possible about its operations. However, publicly
identifying companies who are the subject of unsolicited complaints to
the FTC, in particular, raises issues of due process and fairness. I
would like to better understand whether the Commission can balance the
need for transparency with its law enforcement efforts aimed at illegal
conduct.
Question 6. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created in
response to the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession after it
became clear that our financial sector needed far more oversight to
prevent a disaster of that magnitude from happening ever again. The
current Administration seems intent on gutting this agency that serves
a critical role in protecting Americans from irresponsible financial
institutions. Of course, the CFPB and the FTC complement each other in
their protection of consumers. How do you envision the FTC's role in
holding financial institutions accountable?
Answer. I expect the FTC to play a strong, aggressive role in
holding financial institutions accountable for engaging in unfair or
deceptive acts or practices. As you note, other agencies have
complementary and sometimes primary jurisdiction over financial
institutions, and I expect in those situations we will work
aggressively with our sister agencies to prevent financial institutions
from engaging in prohibited conduct. I also believe the Commission can
and should engage in advocacy and public education to prevent financial
institutions from adopting unsafe or unsound practices, in those areas
in which we have experience and knowledge.
Question 7. Other consumer protection agencies appear to be
reducing the vigor of their enforcement work. In what way should this
impact the priorities of the FTC?
Answer. I intend to have the Commission enforce its laws vigorously
and aggressively; if confirmed, this will be my third significant job
at the Commission, and I would not return to the Commission if I did
not believe strongly and wholeheartedly in its mission. If other
agencies are reducing the vigor of their law enforcement work in areas
where we share jurisdiction, it may be appropriate for us to step up
our efforts.
Question 8. In the past, the FTC has cracked down on for-profit
colleges and vocational programs with strong enforcement actions.
However, we're seeing these institutions continue to defraud Americans.
A study conducted by The Century Foundation found that 98 percent of
complaints asking for student loan forgiveness alleging fraud by
colleges were from students attending for-profit institutions. If
confirmed, how will you protect Americans from being scammed by such
institutions?
Answer. I intend to have the Commission enforce its laws and
regulations in this area aggressively, because as you mentioned, this
is very important work. Student loan debt is a significant burden, and
in return for taking on that debt, students should receive education or
training that is useful in obtaining future employment. I will consult
with the FTC staff, and relevant leadership at the Department of
Education, as well as state enforcers and regulators, to identify
additional ways the FTC can prevent students from falling victim to
educational scams and better obtain remedies when it happens.
Question 9. More than two of every three American households own a
pet. The FTC has estimated they will spend $10.2 billion on medications
this year, of which more than $5 billion require a prescription. It has
been estimated that pet owners who can get a copy of their pet's
prescription and shop around, could save 20 to 30 percent on branded
medications and 50 percent when they purchase generics. This suggests
that prescription portability can save pet owners billions of dollars
every year--in addition to the savings in time and transportation if
they can get those prescriptions filled while they are at the grocery
store or pharmacy or delivered from an online pharmacy. Unlike with
human medications, with our pets, the prescriber also dispenses the
medication prescribed--setting up a conflict of interest whereby the
prescriber is both a health care provider and a retailer.
In testimony in 2016, the FTC stated that ``we believe that the
greater prescription portability likely would enhance competition for
the sale of pet medications and that consumers would benefit from this
competition in the form of lower prices.'' Do you agree with this
conclusion?
Answer. Yes, as in many other areas, portability is likely to
enhance competition. This strikes me as simple economics--it increases
the potential suppliers of pet medication a pet owner can easily
purchase from, and such competition will likely lead to lower pricing.
Question 10. The prescribing and dispensing of human medications
has long been separated. With eyeglasses and contact lenses, where
prescribers also sell the products they prescribe, Federal law grants
consumers the right to their prescriptions. Why should it be any
different for pet owners with regards to medications for their pets?
Answer. I am not aware of any reason, grounded in antitrust law or
consumer protection law, for different treatment.
Question 11. Manufacturers of pet medications can, and do offer
inducements to veterinary clinics to prescribe and sell their
medications.
Do you think the public, and pet owners who spend billions of
dollars annually on prescription pet medications have a right to know
whether their vet clinic is receiving payments from the manufacturers
of drugs that clinic prescribes?
Answer. I think this is an area where the Commission can work with
the relevant ethical and certifying boards to impress upon
veterinarians and clinics the importance of disclosure. However, the
receipt of payments is not, in and of itself, illegal, and may be
offered in support of educational and marketing efforts, among other
things. When that is the case, such payments may increase competition
in the markets for prescription pet medications--for example, such
payments can help encourage the introduction of a new supplier to
compete with an incumbent provider, thus adding, not lessening,
competition. But I will consult with staff about the ways to keep this
market transparent and competitive, to the benefit of consumers.
Question 12. In 2003, Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act (``FCLCA'') to grant the 40 million Americans who wear
contact lens wearers the right to copies of their prescriptions. The
law also established a process for consumers to have their
prescriptions verified when they purchase their lenses from a retailer
other than the prescriber.
On September 3, 2015, the FTC launched its ten-year review of the
Contact Lens Rule. The comment period closed on October 26, 2015, after
the Commission received over 660 comments from a wide variety of
stakeholders including optometrists, ophthalmologists, consumers,
contact lens manufacturers and third-party contact lens sellers such as
big box stores and online retailers.
On December 7, 2016, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (``NPRM'') concluding that ``compliance with the automatic
prescription release provision could be substantially improved.'' This
is consistent with the comments of 20 State Attorneys General who
reported to the Commission that: ``[t]he States are aware, from their
enforcement efforts and collective experience, that not all patients
receive their prescription in writing as a matter of course.'' The NPRM
also proposed the common sense solutions of having consumers sign an
acknowledgement that they have received their prescriptions and
clarifying the right of consumers and their chosen retailers to receive
additional copies of those prescriptions.
If confirmed, will you prioritize finalizing this proposed rule, to
help ensure all consumers will receive copies of their prescriptions,
as Congress intended? Considering FTC's limited resources, and the
significant resources that would be required to take action against
individual prescribers who are not in compliance with this requirement
under the current rule, do you agree that the FTC's proposed rule is an
efficient means of promoting compliance?
Answer. I strongly support the Commission's rules requiring
consumers to receive copies of their prescriptions. The Commission is
continuing to accept and review comments in the rulemaking you
reference, and will soon hold a public conference on the proposed rule,
where interested parties will debate the merits of, and possible
alternatives to, the rule. Therefore, I would like to defer taking a
position on the merits of the rule as currently formulated, and the
Commission's ability to enforce the existing rule, until the record in
this matter is complete.
Question 13. The FTC has not pursued any enforcement activity under
the Military Lending Act, despite having the authority to enforce this
important protection. If confirmed, would you support vigorous
enforcement of the MLA?
Answer. Deceptive practices aimed at our military members and
spouses are abhorrent. I support enforcement of the MLA. I will discuss
with staff, and determine whether there is some deficiency in the Act
that has prevented the Commission from pursuing cases, or whether the
Commission has not yet devoted sufficient resources to this area.
Question 14. There are numerous examples of the FTC exercising
complementary jurisdiction with a specialized agency. How would you
envision FTC's cooperation with other agencies under your leadership?
Answer. It is important that the agency work cooperatively and
comprehensively with its sister agencies, and it is important to
effective law enforcement that agencies with dual or complementary
jurisdiction welcome the efforts of one another. I expect the
Commission to work cooperatively with other agencies, and to leverage
its resources to make such cooperation worthwhile to other agencies,
and to consumers. I will instruct the law enforcement teams in the
Bureaus of Competition and Consumer Protection to alert me quickly if
they believe there are impediments to such cooperation so I, or the
Commission, can take the steps necessary to address them.
Question 15. Under your leadership, will the FTC continue to
thoroughly pursue cases that hold individuals and companies that have
aided and abetted scams accountable--no matter how big or insulated
they may be?
Answer. It is important that the FTC hold accountable firms that
aid and abet other firms in their deceptive and fraudulent scams. We
will enforce the law without regard to how big, powerful or important a
company is. Whether the law on aiding and abetting will allow us to
reach all companies that participate in a scheme, or that control a
company that participates in a scheme, is something I will ask the
General Counsel's office to consider carefully. It is important to
pursue all avenues to choke off the ability of companies to pursue
fraudulent and deceptive conduct; aiding and abetting charges are an
important tool in doing so.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to
Joseph Simons
Question 1. The February 2013, the Federal Trade Commission
published a report that found that five percent of consumers had errors
on their credit reports that could result in less favorable terms for
loans.
a. Based on that study, do you think the consumer reporting
agencies (CRAs) comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)'s
requirement to ``follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum
possible accuracy'' of credit reports? (15 USC 1681e(b))
b. Do you think the FTC should conduct a follow up study to see if
error rates have improved?
c. If error rates continue to impact millions of Americans, what
actions should the FTC take to enforce compliance with the FCRA?
Answer. Answer to (a), (b), and (c): The presence of errors on a
consumer's credit report can have significant financial and non-
financial impacts on that consumer. Whether the prevalence of errors
mentioned is evidence of a failure of the consumer reporting agencies
to comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act is something that, if
confirmed, I will discuss with the Commission staff and, if
appropriate, the leadership of the CFPB. Similarly, whether a follow-up
study is necessary to determine whether error rates are improving is an
issue I will need to discuss with the Commission staff and fellow
commissioners; without the context that information may provide, the
appropriate next steps, if any, are not clear to me. However, this is
an area where we should all expect improvement over time because of the
importance of this issue to consumers.
Question 2. Do you think the policies and practices of CRAs to
handle consumer disputes are in compliance with the FCRA?
Answer. Compliance with the FCRA is critical. However, I simply do
not have sufficient information to provide a response to your question,
nor do I want to prejudge a matter that may come before me at the
Commission. However, this is an important question and, if confirmed, I
will consult with Commission staff to determine if additional efforts
with respect to compliance by the consumer reporting agencies are
required.
Question 3. In 2015, the New York Attorney General reached a
groundbreaking settlement with the three national consumer reporting
agencies--Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. The terms of the
settlement require the CRAs to do more to ensure maximum possible
accuracy of credit reports and to improve the dispute resolution
process for consumers.
Do you think the terms of the settlement regarding dispute
resolution represent best practices for CRAs' compliance with the
FCRA's requirement that CRAs conduct a ``reasonable reinvestigation''
if the consumer disputes the accuracy of the information in his or her
credit report? (15 USC 1681i)
Answer. I do not have sufficient information to give you a legal
conclusion with respect to the CRA's compliance with their
responsibility under the FCRA, nor would I want to prejudge a matter
that may come before me if I am confirmed. If confirmed, I will consult
with the FTC's career staff to determine whether additional action is
warranted with respect to the sufficiency of relief obtained by the
NewYork Attorney General.
Question 4. Can the FTC use its current authorities to hold CRAs to
higher standards when it comes to handling consumer disputes?
Answer. Publicly available information suggests that CRA's handling
of consumer disputes can be improved, but I do not wish to prejudge
whether the CRA's need to be held to higher standards. I would like to
confer with the FTC's career staff and fellow commissioners, and, if
appropriate, the leadership and staff of the CFPB, and determine
whether any further FTC action is necessary. I believe that if there is
a need to hold CRA's to higher standards with respect to billing
disputes, the FTC or other agencies have the authority to do so.
Section 5's prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices is
very broad and, upon a suitable record, the Commission has authority
under the FTC Act, along with the Fair Credit Reporting Act
prohibitions, to define what practices are unfair or deceptive.
Question 5. What are your views on the adequacy of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act enforcement regime?
Answer. I do not yet have sufficient information to provide an
adequate answer. If confirmed, I will consult with the career staff of
the FTC and determine whether the enforcement regime is adequate. In
general, I think we can make improvements in our enforcement efforts by
a better use of our resources and more focused application of our
authority.
Question 6. What are your views on the inclusion of medical debt in
credit reports?
Answer. I believe it is appropriate to consult with the career FTC
staff on this question--it is not an issue I have considered in any
detail during my career, and I would like to have the benefit of the
staff's experience and expertise before formulating a definitive
position.
Question 7. Consumers have the right to inspect their credit
reports every year. Do you think they should also have the right to
inspect their credit score?
Answer. As above, this is not an issue I have considered in any
detail during my career. As such, I would need to consult with the
career FTC staff and come to a conclusion with the staff's experience
and expertise on the matter.
Question 8. Do you think the credit reporting market is functioning
well? In your view, what areas could be improved?
Answer. I believe it is likely that improvements are possible, but
I would need to consult with the career FTC staff on this question. As
it is not an issue I have considered in any detail during my career, I
would like to have the benefit of the staff's experience and guidance
on this issue before reaching a conclusion.
Question 9. Do you think it is sound public policy for consumers to
have to pay to freeze their credit report?
Answer. While such a policy likely does not create the right
incentives for consumers to take steps that may protect them from some
of the costs associated with identity theft, and such costs may create
a barrier to certain consumers' ability to protect themselves, free
credit freezes may not be appropriate in circumstances not associated
with identify theft or data breaches. I would like to confer with the
FTC staff to have the benefit of their experience and thinking on this
issue.
Question 10. Do you think it is confusing for consumers to
understand the difference between freezes, which are defined by and
regulated under state law, and the CRAs' various ``lock'' products,
which fall outside of the protection of state law?
Answer. I can see the potential for confusion, but this is a
question that can be tested empirically and may already be the subject
of such testing. If confirmed, I will ask the career staff to determine
whether there is good quality empirical work on this question and what
that work concludes, and whether any additional work would be useful to
undertake.
Question 11. Should the FTC have the authority to ensure compliance
with the Safeguards Rule?
Answer. The FTC has previously brought enforcement actions against
firms for a failure to comply with the Safeguards Rule; I do not
understand those actions, nor the FTC's authority in this area, to be
particularly controversial.
Question 12. Do you think the FTC has the right expertise and
capacity to investigate and evaluate algorithms for unfair, deceptive,
fraudulent consumer practices in the marketplace?
Answer. The career staff at the FTC is very capable. I expect that
the FTC does have the expertise necessary to investigate and evaluate
algorithms for unfair, deceptive, and fraudulent consumer practices. If
the Commission does not have this expertise, I will confer with fellow
commissioners about acquiring it.
Question 13. Will you prioritize bringing in additional technical
talent to strengthen FTC's mission in the digital domain?
Answer. If confirmed, I intend to make sure the FTC has the
resources it needs to perform its mission, and if that involves more
talent for the digital domain, then yes.
Question 14. What are your views of the FTC's ability to ensure
adequate oversight of online privacy? Please include your perspective
on the FTC's expertise and the adequacy of the regulatory tools
available to it. What specific actions would you propose the FTC
undertake to improve online privacy?
Answer. Properly defining consumers' privacy expectations and
measuring harm associated with the violation of such expectations are
important, and, along with advancement in the Commission's articulation
of its data security expectations, will be a significant focus of the
Commission's enforcement and policy agenda, if my nomination is
confirmed. The broad reach of the Commission's authority and the talent
of the staff, places the Commission in a good position to fulfill its
mission in this area. In terms of specific actions, I would like to
confer with fellow commissioners about bolstering the agency's
expertise in the digital markets, as well as providing additional
guidance to firms and businesses seeking clarity. My intention is to
focus on significant matters that can make the biggest impact in this
area.
Question 15. The FCC's Net Neutrality order is premised upon ISPs
disclosing voluntary policies and the FTC enforcing compliance with
those polices.
Do you agree that the FTC's authority only extends to enforcing a
company's compliance with whatever policy the company issues? If not,
please explain.
Answer. The FTC has full authority under Section 5 to challenge
both competition and consumer protection violations, of which enforcing
compliance with disclosed policies is only one part.
Question 16. If the Ninth Circuit's decision in FTC v. AT&T
Mobility is allowed to stand, what authority, if any, will the FTC
retain to enforce these company policies?
Answer. Such a decision would only be binding in the 9th Circuit,
and it could still be overturned by appeal to the Supreme Court.
Subject to a review of an unfavorable opinion and consultation with the
Commission, the staff and the General Counsel, if the Commission is
unsuccessful in the 9th Circuit, I believe it would be appropriate to
appeal a loss to the Supreme Court.
Question 17. What is your view of the propriety of the FTC imposing
conditions on proposed mergers as compared with suing to block a deal?
How would you evaluate when to use one or the other?
Answer. Imposing conditions on a merger is appropriate when the
merger would otherwise violate the antitrust laws, and the conditions
imposed are very likely to remedy the underlying competitive concerns
so that consumer welfare will not be harmed. When a merger would
violate the antitrust laws and a good remedy short of blocking the
transaction is not available, then the transaction should be blocked
outright.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tom Udall to
Joseph Simons
Question 1. What are your ideas how to promote consumer protection
in an increasingly online--and connected--world?
Answer. Markets today are evolving quickly, and it is incumbent
upon the FTC to keep up. If confirmed, I will assure that agency staff
and resources are committed to keeping our enforcement and consumer
education agenda current and responsive to new products and markets. We
will closely study emerging challenges, and vigorously enforce our
consumer protection laws, as more and more of life and commerce moves
online.
Question 2. Do you believe that the current FTC enforcement
principles are sufficient to protect consumers? And do you believe the
FTC has the resources necessary to protect consumers given the
significant amount of work on the docket for the agency?
Answer. The FTC holds broad authority to stamp out unfair or
deceptive acts or practices, and has a long, bipartisan tradition of
using that authority to protect consumers. If confirmed, I plan to
vigorously enforce those laws. Along with fellow commissioners, I plan
to take stock of what else the FTC may need, and I would be happy to
work with you and this Committee to fill any gaps we may find.
Question 3.In December, I wrote to the FTC, along with Senators
Schumer and Blumenthal, asking for a workshop to discuss the increased
use of ``bots'' to purchase large quantities of in-demand toys and
items, particularly at Christmas. The FTC has confirmed that it will
engage with key stakeholders to determine if a workshop is necessary.
Will you commit to reviewing the record on this issue and to working
with my office to determine next steps, including the possibility of
legislation?
Answer. Yes.
Question 4. Last week, an article in TechCrunch showed how Facebook
uses data from Onavo Protect, a subsidiary app, to gather data on its
competitors; how Google uses its search rankings to demote alternate
competitive sites; and Amazon's aggressive low pricing undercuts book
publishers. Under your respective leadership, how will the FTC enforce
the principles of unfair methods of competition against tech giants
like Facebook, Google and Amazon to promote consumer welfare?
Answer. Consistent with my previous tenure at the FTC, I plan to
forcefully enforce our antitrust laws, so as to assure the economy
continues to produce benefits for consumers. The Commission will need
to study emerging trends closely and assure that our agenda reflects
the most current pressing challenges. Where warranted, I plan to work
with fellow commissioners to aggressively pursue law enforcement
actions needed to keep markets competitive.
Question 5. Following the FTC's approval of the Google/DoubleClick
acquisition in 2007, then Commissioner Pamela Jones Harbor released a
dissent detailing the need for the commission to ``evaluate the
implication of this kind of data merger from a competition as well as a
consumer protection perspective.'' As commissioner, how would you use
this framing of data mergers in evaluating mergers and acquisitions in
the technology industry?
Answer. If confirmed, I intend to take a close look at the evolving
technology space, and will assure that the FTC brings its expertise to
bear in studying emerging trends. Our consumer protection and
competition efforts must remain current with evolving markets, and the
collection of data is an important part of that.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to
Joseph Simons
Question 1. When Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act in 2004 it helped reduce barriers to retail competition
in the contact lens market and led to lower prices for consumers.
However, contact retailers sometimes sell patients contact lenses after
the prescription has expired or fail to adequately verify the
prescription in accordance to FCLCA. In some cases, this has led to
dangerous eye and health conditions for the patient. How can the FTC
work in coordination with the FDA, CDC and other Federal agencies to
make sure contact lens patients are receiving high quality care and
safe contact lenses?
Answer. It is critical that the FTC work closely with other
agencies where jurisdiction overlaps and goals can be pursued jointly.
If confirmed, I plan to assure that the FTC brings both its expertise
and authority to bear on the Contact Lens Rule, and to work closely
with other agencies like the FDA and CDC.
Question 2. In December 2016, the FTC issued a proposed change to
the current Contact Lens Rule that mandated that all eye doctors obtain
a signed acknowledgement form from each of their contact lens patients
when they receive a copy of their prescription. Do you know of any
other ways for patients to understand their right to their contact lens
prescription that would be just as, if not, more effective than a
written acknowledgement?
Answer. If confirmed, I plan to confer closely with staff at the
Commission to explore alternative approaches in addressing the needs of
both a competitive contact lens market and patient safety. As a part of
ongoing efforts in this area, there is a public workshop scheduled in
March that will provide the Commission with information to move
forward.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
to Joseph Simons
Question 1. Restoring Internet Freedom FCC-FTC MOU
Within the net neutrality MOU, signed between the FCC and FTC,
regarding the FTC's authority it states: ``Congress has directed the
FTC to, among other things, prevent unfair methods of competition and
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.''
Therefore, can you say without reservation that you'll have what
you will need, upon being confirmed at the FTC, to actually catch
improper actions taken by Internet service providers toward consumers?
Answer. The rule was only very recently issued, and thus I would
like a chance to confer with staff about it. But I can say that, if
confirmed, I will vigorously enforce our laws and use every tool we
have to assure the fairness and competitiveness of our markets,
upstream and downstream. In the event that our authority does not prove
enough to get that job done, I will come back to you and this committee
to talk about a solution.
Question 2. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
Unfortunately we still don't know the full FTC authority over
common carriers, like in the case pending on AT&T, so I would like to
hear what you anticipate will be FTC's authority going forward.
Answer. There are certainly open questions about the FTC's
authority resulting from the pending case. I will be following it
closely, and should the result leave the FTC with less authority than
is necessary to accomplish both our consumer protection and competition
missions, I will come back to this committee and work towards a
solution.
Question 3. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
How you can ensure the FTC will even have the authority to enforce
the limited principles covered in Chairman Pai's weak form of net
neutrality?
Answer. I am committed to vigorously enforcing the broad mandate of
the FTC to stamp out unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and keep
our markets competitive for consumers. Should that not prove enough, I
will be eager to work with you and the committee in finding a solution.
Question 4. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
And I would ask if you can provide me a true commitment to act on
behalf of consumers who are impacted by less than fair practices by
some in the telecommunications industry.
Answer. Absolutely.
Question 5. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
Can you please define for me what the lead telecommunications
policy expert Federal agency is, in your opinion?
Answer. The FCC has enormous subject matter expertise in
telecommunications. The FTC also has an outstanding staff of attorneys
and economists who are capable of providing invaluable insight into the
industry and how to keep it competitive, and free from deceptive or
unfair acts or practices.
Question 6. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
Have you specifically recently read the MOU on net neutrality
between the FCC and FTC, and do you support it in its entirety?
Answer. I have read the memo of understanding, and will support it
as long as it stays in effect.
Question 7. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
What is your understanding of the capacity of the staff currently
at the FTC, and do you think you can effectively execute this agreement
enough to garner true public trust in ensuring a truly free and open
internet?
Answer. The FTC has an outstanding staff that does exceptional work
in supporting enforcement actions aimed at keeping markets free, fair,
and competitive. Of course, it is also incumbent upon the FTC to stay
current as innovation leads to rapid market evolution, and to that end,
if confirmed, I will confer with staff about bringing in all necessary
subject matter experts.
Question 8. Consumer Education
The net neutrality MOU between the FCC-FTC includes the reference
to ``Collaboration on consumer and industry outreach and education
efforts, as appropriate.'' As well as: ``The Agencies may coordinate
and cooperate to develop guidance to assist consumers' understanding of
Internet service provider practices.'' It strikes me in many cases it
will be difficult to respond to many potential violations to an
Internet provider's stated policy, so we need to make sure you're
working on behalf of the consumer to act as a form of deterrent.
So will you be prioritizing consumer education on how to document
and submit complaints to the FTC for review?
Answer. Yes, it will play an important role in our enforcement
efforts.
Question 9. Supposed Transparency and ISP's Public Policies
The net neutrality MOU between the FCC-FTC states: Consistent with
its jurisdiction, the FTC will investigate and take enforcement action
as appropriate against Internet service providers for unfair,
deceptive, or otherwise unlawful acts or practices, including but not
limited to, actions pertaining to the accuracy of the disclosures such
providers make pursuant to the Internet Freedom Order's requirements,
as well as their marketing, advertising, and promotional activities.
Do you have a sense that you can ask ISPs to amend their supposed
transparent blocking and throttling language or commitments?
Answer. Nothing stops the FTC from asking an ISP to clarify its
language, nor from suggesting ways in which firms can amend their
marketing materials to avoid being deceptive or unfair.
Question 10. In other words, is it your opinion that your authority
at the FTC includes determining whether the ISPs are being transparent
or in other cases, just presenting a very broad policy that leaves gaps
in a consumer's understanding of their providers protections or
limitations to control the flow of information to them?
Answer. The authority of the FTC to police unfair or deceptive acts
or practices is quite broad. To the extent an ISP issues a policy that
leaves gaps and is deceptive or unfair, the Commission has the
authority to proceed against such an ISP and should do so.
Question 11. Broadband Internet Speed Honesty
I am aware that various state Attorneys General are concerned that
a telecomm industry petition to the FCC on cost transparency, related
to the advertisement of Internet speeds, quote ``represents nothing
more than the industry's effort to shield itself from state law
enforcement.''
Given the FTC's mission regarding deceptive practices, can you
speak to your perspective on whether this is fair consumer protection
issue to be concerned about at FTC, given the prices and promises ISPs
make to generate more business?
Answer. I am unclear on how the petition you describe may possibly
shield firms from state law enforcement, and I can consult agency staff
on the matter, if confirmed. But I will commit to you that I intend to
work closely with our state counterparts to prevent, remedy, and punish
firms from making material promises to consumers that they ignore or
fail to keep.
Question 12. Protection of Minorities, Children, and other specific
Groups
Considering the fact that in 2011, FTC estimated 11 percent of
American adults were fraud victims, and 13.4 percent of Hispanics were
victims, almost 50 percent higher than the rate for non-Hispanic
whites.\1\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Current acting FTC Chair Ohlhausen has detailed a specific effort
to assist those where English is their second language through things
like her Every Community Initiative.
Can you commit to continue efforts like to this to ensure we keep
our focus of consumer protection on all of our populations?
Answer. Yes.
Question 13. FTC Investigation on GPS tracking of Vehicles
Last year it was revealed that the Federal Trade Commission is
investigating GPS tracking technologies used in the subprime auto loan
industry, but my understanding is that no findings or rulings have been
released. Going back as far 2014, the New York Times had highlighted
this as a concern. In their piece, they highlighted a troubling story
of a mother in Las Vegas, Mary Bolender, who needed to get her child
with a 103.5-degree fever to the ER, but her 2005 Chrysler van wouldn't
start. As the piece says--``The cause was not a mechanical problem--it
was her lender.''
Now I have a number of concerns with their as a business practice,
but can I get a commitment from you to continue to look into this issue
and publically provide information on your findings and enforcement
determinations in a timely manner?
Answer. It is important that I not prejudge the outcome of what you
have described. But, generally speaking, yes, I will continue to look
into this issue and consult with the FTC staff on the status and
substance of any ongoing or related investigation. Any public
discussion of the FTC's investigation and enforcement decisions can
only be made in consultation with my fellow commissioners and must take
account of how any publicity may affect existing or future
investigations or enforcement actions.
Question 14. Franchise Business Oversight
The FTC has jurisdiction over franchise businesses. In my state, I
have heard complaints from Subway franchisees that the Franchise
Disclosure Document is written in favor of the franchisor in a way that
can undermine their ability to succeed. Nevada's neighboring state of
California has passed a bill protecting franchisees. How can the FTC
expand protections for franchisees so they can financially succeed?
Answer. The franchisor-franchisee relationship is governed by
various laws and regulations, including, in some instances, state law
and regulation, and the effect of those various laws and regulations
may, in some instances, be to favor one party to the franchise
contract. I am not aware of the complaints you have identified, but I
can commit to discussing with the staff of the FTC whether they have
heard similar complaints from these and other franchisees, and whether
such concerns can be and are appropriate to be addressed by the FTC.
Question 15. Mortgage Closing Fraud
Thieves have been targeting mortgage closings, where they break
into a realtor or title company's e-mail accounts. Then, they tell the
homebuyer to wire money they have saved and borrowed to a bank account
owned by the thieves. How do you think the FTC can work with the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to prevent these types of scams?
Answer. Fraudulent conduct, especially frauds that create
significant financial harm, should be attacked vigorously. I intend for
the FTC to continue working closely with the CFPB to combat financial
fraud. I am not yet privy to the extent of the FTC-CFPB relationship
and cooperation, nor internal procedures that allocate resources to
such matters. I plan, if confirmed, to discuss this with FTC staff and
my fellow commissioners, as well as CFPB staff and senior leadership,
in order to determine how best to work together to limit such scams and
fraudulent behavior. Finally, where such conduct is better prosecuted
as criminal conduct, I will continue the FTC's practice of working with
U.S. Attorneys in addressing the issue.
Question 16. Reverse Mortgages
Reverse mortgages are products sold to seniors to help them ``age-
in-place'' and use their home equity as a means by which to responsibly
pay their bills. Reverse mortgages can be sensible products, but
sometimes have been falsely advertised to seniors. The FTC and the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau conducted a ``sweep'' of reverse
mortgage advertisements, and a review of consumer complaints, and found
that three reverse mortgage companies engaged in deceptive advertising
which misled consumers.
Given the overlapping jurisdictions between the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau and the FTC, can you discuss how you envision the two
entities work together to combat financial fraud, specifically scams
impacting seniors?
Answer. I intend for the FTC to continue working closely with the
CFPB to combat financial fraud, including but not limited to scams
impacting senior citizens. I think it is important that each agency
bring to such matters those rules, regulations, enforcement tools, and
penalty provisions that maximize our ability to stop such conduct and
protect consumers from becoming victims of it. Again, I am not yet
privy to the extent of the FTC-CFPB relationship and cooperation, nor
internal procedures that allocate resources to such matters, but I plan
to discuss this with the FTC staff and my fellow commissioners, as well
as CFPB staff and senior leadership.
Question 17. Debt Collection
Debt collectors generate more complaints to the FTC than any other
industry. And in recent years, the CFPB has noted that debt collection
remains the top complaint received by the Bureau from older Americans.
Specifically, the Consumer Bureau identified several issues related to
debt collection and seniors, including hounding calls, harassment and
threats of impermissible Social Security garnishment.
How do you think the FTC could work with the CFPB to bring more
rules-of-the road to this part of the financial services marketplace to
protect consumers--particularly seniors--from fraudulent practices?
Answer. This is a very important issue--our must vulnerable are
often targets of fraud and deceptive conduct by unscrupulous actors.
With respect to how the FTC can better work with the CFPB in this area,
I intend to consult with the staff of the FTC and the CFPB, as well as
my commissioner colleagues and the senior staff of the CFPB, to confirm
we are making maximum use of our resources and authority. Some of this
conduct is, and should be prosecuted criminally, and I will continue
the FTC's practice of working with U.S. Attorneys to attack the most
egregious and harmful deceptive and fraudulent conduct where criminal
penalties can apply.
Question 18. Merger Review Commitment
With increased multi-industry players growing in prominence by
acquiring more businesses outside their core business model, can you
commit to reviewing the horizontal merger guidelines, which have not
directly addressed vertical mergers since 1984?
Answer. Yes.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Roger F. Wicker to
Christine S. Wilson
Question 1. Many online companies are engaging in targeted
advertising. Using consumer data, companies can target what they deem
to be the most relevant ads to consumers. Should there be more
transparency into how the algorithms behind targeted advertising work
so that consumers can see how they are being targeted for certain
messages?
Answer. I have had an opportunity to review publicly available
materials regarding the FTC's recent research in this area. If
confirmed, I would speak with FTC staff regarding any additional non-
public work that the agency has already undertaken in this space, and
any conclusions that have been drawn from that work. In conjunction
with my colleagues on the Commission, I would carefully evaluate the
issues presented by this type of algorithm that fall within the
jurisdiction and authority of the FTC and how best to address them.
Question 2. Would third party audits of algorithms be a reasonable
way to ensure the algorithms are doing what companies claim and not
harming competition or consumer choice? Is this something the FTC might
consider looking into?
Answer. I have had an opportunity to review publicly available
materials regarding the FTC's recent research in this area. If
confirmed, I would speak with FTC staff regarding any additional non-
public work that the agency has already undertaken in this space, and
any conclusions that have been drawn from that work. In conjunction
with my colleagues on the Commission, I would carefully evaluate the
issues presented by this type of algorithm that fall within the
jurisdiction and authority of the FTC and how best to address them.
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to
Christine S. Wilson
Question 1. As a former Attorney General of Alaska, I always
appreciated coordination with Federal agencies where appropriate, and
the opportunity to communicate solutions that made the most sense for
Alaskans. Given the importance of state attorneys general to the FTC's
antitrust enforcement, please describe your views on the working
relationship between the FTC and state attorneys general.
Answer. In my experience, the FTC and the state AGs have had a
close and constructive working relationship. If confirmed, I would
encourage FTC staff and my fellow Commissioners to continue this
tradition.
Question 2. As you know, the state I represent is unique which
means its problems are unique and require unconventional solutions. In
a highly rural state like Alaska, many communities are not connected by
roads, challenging weather conditions prohibit timely delivery of mail
and other essential services, and quality connectivity is considered a
luxury. One of your objectives at the Commission is consumer protection
and education. How will you ensure that rural constituents like mine
have the tools they need to make informed decisions and in cases of
abuse that require follow up, for example data breaches or identity
theft, the information necessary to mitigate risks and resolve the
issue?
Answer. It is important that the FTC's good work on consumer
protection and consumer education be made available to all citizens,
including your constituents and those who are similarly situated in
rural communities across America. The FTC has sought in various ways to
ensure that its education initiatives and information regarding its
enforcement actions reach their intended audiences. For example, during
my tenure as Chairman Muris' Chief of Staff, the FTC rolled out many
Spanish-language consumer education materials. In addition, many FTC
orders require the respondent in an enforcement proceeding to
distribute to customers, board members, and other stakeholders
materials pertaining to the alleged law violations. If confirmed, I
look forward to working with the FTC staff (including in the FTC
regional offices) and my colleagues on the Commission to ensure that
ever-increasing numbers of consumers--including those in rural
communities--are able to obtain needed information.
Question 3. In your prepared statement, you discuss anticompetitive
consolidation, which immediately called to mind the enormous market
capitalization of tech companies. Recent calculations value the four
largest tech companies' capitalization at $2.8 trillion, which is a
staggering 24 percent of the S&P 500 Top 50, close to the value of
every stock traded on the Nasdaq in 2001, and to give a different
perspective, approximately the same amount as France's current GDP.
Press reports have also noted allegations of increased anti-competitive
behavior by some of these companies. Is there a point at which these
companies are simply too big from an antitrust standpoint?
Answer. The size of a company may or may not indicate the existence
of market power, and it is market power, not size per se, that lies at
the heart of antitrust analysis. Companies that grow by providing
innovative products and services at attractive prices (i.e., through
superior skill, foresight, and industry, in the words of a seminal
antitrust case) create benefits for consumers.
In these instances, the FTC most effectively promotes consumer
welfare by refraining from intervening. But companies that grow or
maintain their preeminence by engaging in what may be anticompetitive
or exclusionary conduct can and should be closely scrutinized by the
FTC.

Question. When Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act in 2003, it was a pro-consumer measure that ensured
consumers automatically receive a copy of his or her prescription after
an eye exam--without having to ask for it, pay an additional fee, or
sign a waiver. Do you agree that consumers should receive copies of
their prescriptions as Congress intended so that they can use the
prescription to purchase their contact lenses from a source of their
choosing?
Answer. Yes.

Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Jim Inhofe to
Christine S. Wilson
Question. The Federal Trade Commission can be an advocate for
competition and an unfettered free market--both here in the United
States and abroad. You have a background dealing with antitrust
enforcement and consumer protection regulations internationally. How
can the Federal Trade Commission continue to lead on antitrust
enforcement and consumer protection issues such as fraud prevention on
the international stage? What more can the Federal Trade Commission do
to ensure that due process is respected and U.S. consumers and
companies are treated fairly by other jurisdictions.
Answer. The FTC has long provided an important perspective on the
sound enforcement of competition and consumer protection issues in the
international arena. The FTC makes its views known through its
participation in multilateral organizations like the OECD and the
International Competition Network, through formal bilateral
relationships between the U.S. and other jurisdictions, through
informal consultations, and through technical assistance programs.
Given the proliferation of competition and consumer protection regimes
abroad, and the emergence of decisions by foreign authorities
potentially motivated either by a desire to protect national champions
or by other industrial engineering considerations, these efforts are
more important than ever. As your question notes, I have worked
extensively on international competition/consumer protection law and
policy issues, and if confirmed, I would hope to contribute
significantly to the efforts of the FTC to promote due process and
sound enforcement abroad. Moreover, given the importance of
international cooperation when addressing fraud, if confirmed, and in
conjunction with my colleagues, I would support continued robust global
cooperation to combat fraud and to identify ever better ways to
identify and halt this pernicious conduct.
______
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Bill Nelson to
Christine S. Wilson
Question 1. The FTC is a relatively small agency that has to
effectively use its resources to cover a very broad jurisdiction. In
this regard, as a matter of discretion, it may be wise for the FTC to
pursue enforcement cases involving practices that result in substantial
harm. However, substantial harm is not a legal requirement under
section five of the FTC Act--cases involving deception do not require
harm at all, and cases involving unfairness can involve harm that is
prospective and/or non-financial. Consequently, it is very important
that commissioners do not stringently require types of harm as a legal
test for agency enforcement actions. This principle is particularly
important because Lab MD is challenging the FTC's legal authority to
bring enforcement actions for data breaches based on the lack of
requisite harm. As a commissioner, will you pledge to not require
substantial harm or financial harm as legal tests for FTC enforcement
actions?
Answer. If confirmed, I will enforce the terms of the FTC Act,
together with corresponding guidelines and relevant judicial precedent.
Section 5(n) provides that an unfair act or practice is one that is
``likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not
reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by
countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition.'' This
provision is an important part of the Commission's organic statute, and
I pledge to enforce it, consistent with its purpose and statutory
language, using the three-part test reflected therein. I agree that
injury can include non-financial forms of harm, including prospective
harm.
Deception is viewed as a subset of unfairness that can be analyzed
on a truncated basis. The FTC's Policy Statement on Deception provides
that a practice is deceptive if it is likely to mislead consumers
acting reasonably under the circumstances to their detriment. In modern
usage, ``to their detriment'' has been replaced with ``about a material
issue.'' It is viewed as a strict liability standard--if the elements
described above are met, further analysis of costs and benefits
typically is not necessary.
Question 2. The FTC's Bureau of Economics provides valuable insight
and analysis that supplements the FTC's work. However, the FTC is,
first and foremost, a law enforcement agency, not a regulatory agency.
As such, economic analysis should play a complementary role, not a
dispositive one. The FTC should enforce the FTC Act and the other laws
under its jurisdiction according to legal doctrine, not economic
analyses. As a commissioner, will you pledge to continue to further the
FTC as a law enforcement agency in which the Bureau of Economics and
economic analyses play a complimentary role, not a dispositive role?
Will you pledge to enforce the law according to legal precedent?
Answer. If confirmed, I will enforce the terms of the FTC Act,
together with corresponding guidelines and relevant judicial precedent.
Of course, economic analysis plays an important role in identifying
sectors of the economy where consumer injury is significant and/or
growing; appropriately evaluating scientific, statistical, or other
technical data; and analyzing the likely competitive effects of mergers
and the potentially harmful effects of various types of conduct.
While I was Chief of Staff to FTC Chairman Muris, I saw how the use
of economic analysis reshaped the FTC's privacy program to focus on
harm to consumers, leading to the National Do Not Call Registry, the
agency's cases against inadequate security provisions, and cases
against major companies like Microsoft and Pfizer for privacy
violations.
Question 3. Piracy continues to be a problem that plagues content
providers. The Internet is filled with websites that provide pirated
content and entertainment at the expense of the companies that produce
the content. Moreover, many of these websites can harm consumers with
unsafe or even fraudulent data and commercial practices. What can the
FTC do to crack down on the illegal piracy of American entertainment
and content?
Answer. I have not had an opportunity to consider the FTC's role
with respect to the narrow issue of piracy, but I understand that
piracy impacts incentives to innovate. If confirmed, I look forward to
consulting with FTC staff and my colleagues on the Commission regarding
actions that can be taken by the FTC within the scope of its authority.
To the extent piracy is accompanied by unfair and/or deceptive acts,
including fraudulent data and commercial practices, I will support
vigorous enforcement of Section 5.
Question 4. Fraudulent websites can deceive consumers by
masquerading as legitimate hotel websites. Consumers who are fooled by
these sites reserve rooms that do not exist or turn out to be different
from what they reserved online. According to industry statistics, this
particular fraud affects millions of consumers a year and costs the
hotel industry hundreds of millions of dollars. I wrote former FTC
Chairwoman Edith Ramirez about this issue in June 2015. Will you pledge
to ensure that the FTC will work with other law enforcement entities
(such as state attorneys general) to bring enforcement actions against
fraudulent hotel websites?
Answer. The FTC has a long history of working cooperatively with
other federal, state, and foreign agencies to bring bad actors to
justice. If confirmed, I will support the FTC's continued efforts to
coordinate with other law enforcement authorities to halt practices
that are unfair, deceptive, or both, including with respect to
fraudulent hotel websites.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Amy Klobuchar to
Christine S. Wilson
Question 1. The high prices of prescription drugs impose a heavy
burden on consumers and are projected to continue to rise in the years
to come. Some branded pharmaceutical companies refuse to provide
generic drug companies branded samples needed for testing generic
equivalents, particularly in the context of drugs subject to a Risk
Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS). This tactic can delay the
introduction of affordable generic drugs for years. I introduced the
Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples (CREATES) Act
with Senators Grassley, Leahy, and Lee to provide a targeted solution
to this problem. Do you believe that branded pharmaceutical companies
withholding testing samples from generic drug companies can lead to
consumer harm?
Answer. The Hatch-Waxman Act established a careful balance between
preserving incentives to innovate and introducing generic competition
for branded products. The FTC has observed over time that certain
practices can skew this carefully established balance. During my tenure
as Chief of Staff to Chairman Muris, the FTC conducted a 6(b) study
that identified practices in the pharmaceutical industry that
threatened to distort the careful balance struck in Hatch-Waxman. Based
on these findings, the FTC made recommendations to Congress and the FDA
regarding alterations to the Hatch-Waxman process. Many of those
recommendations were subsequently implemented.
Certain branded manufacturer practices of which I am aware,
relating to the withholding of branded drug samples from generic
companies, have given me cause for concern. If confirmed, I would
support the FTC in conducting further analysis of this issue and making
recommendations to Congress and the FDA as appropriate.
Question 2. What can the FTC do, under existing law, to protect
consumers and ensure that they benefit from generic drug competition?
Answer. The FTC has a rich history of working to promote
competition in the pharmaceutical space. (In fact, during my first
stint at the FTC while in law school, preserving competition in the
pharmaceutical industry was a significant focus of my work.) It is my
understanding that the FTC has investigated alleged competitive
restraints involving Restricted Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies
(REMS) and voluntary distribution issues, and has filed amicus briefs
in private suits. If confirmed, I would talk with relevant personnel in
the Bureau of Competition and the General Counsel's Office, as well as
with my colleagues on the Commission, about the extent to which the
FTC's existing authority appropriately can be used to address
anticompetitive conduct in this arena.
______
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Richard Blumenthal to
Christine S. Wilson
Question 1. What experience do you have working with State
Attorneys General? What are your views regarding the Commission working
with state law enforcement?
Answer. During my tenure as Chief of Staff to Chairman Tim Muris,
the state attorneys general played an important role in many different
matters involving both competition and consumer protection issues and
competition advocacy efforts. From my experience in both government and
private practice, I have found that state AGs are frequently more
familiar with the details regarding local impacts of business practices
and proposed mergers, and therefore complement the FTC's own efforts.
In addition, as Mr. Phillips noted during the Feb. 14 hearing, the
state AGs can be a useful ``force multiplier'' for the FTC. The
relationship between the FTC and state AGs has been quite constructive,
and if I am confirmed, I would endeavor to continue this tradition.
Question 2. In the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, Congress gave the FTC
extensive authority over the sale, servicing, and leasing of
automobiles--charging it to protect consumers from abusive auto lending
practices and granting it exclusive authority to draft rules governing
unfair or deceptive acts or practices by automobile dealers. Would you
support the FTC using its rulemaking authority to rein in unfair or
deceptive acts or practices by automobile dealers?
Answer. The FTC enforces many laws applicable to auto dealers,
including the FTC Act, the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) and Regulation
Z; the Consumer Leasing Act (CLA) and Regulation M; the Equal Credit
Opportunity Act (ECOA) and Regulation B; and the Fair Credit Reporting
Act (FCRA). The agency also enforces various FTC rules, such as the
Used Car Rule, the Holder Rule, the Furnisher Rule, and the Credit
Practices Rule.
Since 2012, the FTC has brought 40 enforcement actions targeting
deceptive and/or unfair practices in the auto marketplace undertaken by
both independent and franchise dealers. These actions have included
deceptive dealer advertising; deceptive and unfair practices in the
finance office; deceptive title loan, debt collection, and debt relief
practices; privacy and data security failures; deceptive warranty
practices; deceptive green claims; and credit reporting violations.
If confirmed, I will consult with FTC staff and my colleagues on
the Commission to determine whether a rulemaking would provide even
greater benefits to auto consumers and even greater clarity to auto
dealers about expected conduct.
Question 3. More than 17 million Americans are the victims of
identity theft every year. This problem seems to increase year over
year as identity theft scams seem to get more sophisticated.
Three years ago, the FTC established IdentityTheft.gov. This site
is supposed to be a one-stop shop for victims of identity theft where
they can easily freeze credit across the big three credit reporting
agencies, and recover their stolen identities.
This website's functionality is limited, however, because of what
appears to be a lack of engagement by the credit bureaus to make the
site what it should be.
How would you engage with credit bureaus to ensure
IdentityTheft.gov has a comprehensive suite of easy to use tools
allowing victims of identity theft to recover as quickly as possible,
with as little stress as possible? What are your expectations with
respect to the role the credit reporting agencies should play in making
IdentityTheft.gov an effective one-stop shop for identity theft
victims?
Answer. Identity theft has been an important issue for consumers
and, consequently, a significant focus of the FTC. If confirmed, I will
consult with FTC staff and my colleagues on the Commission to determine
how IdentityTheft.gov can be improved, including through greater
cooperation from the credit reporting agencies, and will lend my
support to implementing all appropriate measures.
Question 4. Would you support FTC's jurisdiction be expanded to
include non-profits and charities so that it can act more swiftly to
prevent and stop illegal conduct in the nonprofit sector?
Answer. I have not had an opportunity to study this important
issue. If confirmed, I would consult with FTC staff and my colleagues
on the Commission regarding this issue, and would welcome the
opportunity to discuss it with Congress, as appropriate.
Question 5. Other Federal agencies charged with consumer protection
make an array of data available on consumer complaints received. The
FTC releases relatively very little data on companies receiving
significant levels of complaints. Do you think the FTC should be more
transparent about the complaints it receives?
Answer. It is my understanding that the FTC periodically publishes
an analysis of the consumer complaints that it receives. As a general
rule, I believe that greater flows of information lead to more informed
consumers and more efficient markets. Here, it may be that more
information could allow consumers to more effectively direct their
business to providers of goods and services who deal fairly and
honestly with their customers. If confirmed, I would consult with FTC
staff and my colleagues on the Commission to determine the extent to
which releasing additional and/or different types of information would
advance this goal.
Question 6. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created in
response to the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession after it
became clear that our financial sector needed far more oversight to
prevent a disaster of that magnitude from happening ever again. The
current Administration seems intent on gutting this agency that serves
a critical role in protecting Americans from irresponsible financial
institutions. Of course, the CFPB and the FTC complement each other in
their protection of consumers. How do you envision the FTC's role in
holding financial institutions accountable?
Answer. If confirmed, I will vigorously enforce the FTC Act (and
other laws and rules within the jurisdiction of the FTC) with respect
to all industries, including financial services. I will also encourage
the FTC to work closely with the CFPB, pursuant to the terms of the
FTC/CFPB MOU, to ensure that consumers are protected.
Question 7. Other consumer protection agencies appear to be
reducing the vigor of their enforcement work. In what way should this
impact the priorities of the FTC?
Answer. The FTC excels at monitoring consumer complaints and then
deploying resources accordingly. If confirmed, and in conjunction with
my colleagues on the Commission, I would encourage FTC staff to
continue its industry-monitoring processes to identify areas where
consumers may be experiencing unfair or deceptive acts or practices and
to deploy resources accordingly--particularly if those areas of concern
are not being addressed elsewhere.
Question 8. In the past, the FTC has cracked down on for-profit
colleges and vocational programs with strong enforcement actions.
However, we're seeing these institutions continue to defraud Americans.
A study conducted by The Century Foundation found that 98 percent of
complaints asking for student loan forgiveness alleging fraud by
colleges were from students attending for-profit institutions. If
confirmed, how will you protect Americans from being scammed by such
institutions?
Answer. If confirmed, I will work with FTC staff and my colleagues
on the Commission to ensure that unfair or deceptive practices in all
industries, including in the for-profit education space, are addressed.
Question 9. More than two of every three American households own a
pet. The FTC has estimated they will spend $10.2 billion on medications
this year, of which more than $5 billion require a prescription. It has
been estimated that pet owners who can get a copy of their pet's
prescription and shop around, could save 20 to 30 percent on branded
medications and 50 percent when they purchase generics. This suggests
that prescription portability can save pet owners billions of dollars
every year--in addition to the savings in time and transportation if
they can get those prescriptions filled while they are at the grocery
store or pharmacy or delivered from an online pharmacy. Unlike with
human medications, with our pets, the prescriber also dispenses the
medication prescribed--setting up a conflict of interest whereby the
prescriber is both a health care provider and a retailer.
In testimony in 2016, the FTC stated that ``we believe that the
greater prescription portability likely would enhance competition for
the sale of pet medications and that consumers would benefit from this
competition in the form of lower prices.'' Do you agree with this
conclusion?
Answer. Yes. I believe that prescription portability can foster
beneficial competition.
Question 10. The prescribing and dispensing of human medications
has long been separated. With eyeglasses and contact lenses, where
prescribers also sell the products they prescribe, Federal law grants
consumers the right to their prescriptions. Why should it be any
different for pet owners with regards to medications for their pets?
Answer. As noted above, it would seem that prescription portability
for pet medications would benefit consumers, assuming appropriate
consideration of safety concerns. If confirmed, I would be very
interested in discussing this issue with FTC staff, my colleagues on
the Commission, industry stakeholders, and with the FDA.
Question 11. Manufacturers of pet medications can, and do offer
inducements to veterinary clinics to prescribe and sell their
medications. Do you think the public, and pet owners who spend billions
of dollars annually on prescription pet medications have a right to
know whether their vet clinic is receiving payments from the
manufacturers of drugs that clinic prescribes?
Answer. This issue appears analogous to the marketing efforts of
branded drug manufacturers undertaken with respect to prescribing
physicians. If confirmed, I would be very interested in discussing this
issue with FTC staff, my colleagues on the Commission, and with the FDA
to determine whether there are actions the FTC could take to boost
transparency and enhance competition.
Question 12. In 2003, Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act (``FCLCA'') to grant the 40 million Americans who wear
contact lens wearers the right to copies of their prescriptions. The
law also established a process for consumers to have their
prescriptions verified when they purchase their lenses from a retailer
other than the prescriber.
On September 3, 2015, the FTC launched its ten-year review of the
Contact Lens Rule. The comment period closed on October 26, 2015, after
the Commission received over 660 comments from a wide variety of
stakeholders including optometrists, ophthalmologists, consumers,
contact lens manufacturers and third-party contact lens sellers such as
big box stores and online retailers.
On December 7, 2016, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (``NPRM'') concluding that ``compliance with the automatic
prescription release provision could be substantially improved.'' This
is consistent with the comments of 20 State Attorneys General who
reported to the Commission that: ``[t]he States are aware, from their
enforcement efforts and collective experience, that not all patients
receive their prescription in writing as a matter of course.'' The NPRM
also proposed the common sense solutions of having consumers sign an
acknowledgement that they have received their prescriptions and
clarifying the right of consumers and their chosen retailers to receive
additional copies of those prescriptions.
If confirmed, will you prioritize finalizing this proposed rule, to
help ensure all consumers will receive copies of their prescriptions,
as Congress intended? Considering FTC's limited resources, and the
significant resources that would be required to take action against
individual prescribers who are not in compliance with this requirement
under the current rule, do you agree that the FTC's proposed rule is an
efficient means of promoting compliance?
Answer. My understanding is that the FTC has received and is
analyzing thousands of comments on this and related issues, and is
holding a workshop in March on this topic. If confirmed, I will work
with staff to understand the nature of the feedback received from
consumers, industry, and others regarding how best to promote
competition while preserving patient safety. I will then coordinate
with my colleagues on the Commission to move forward accordingly.
Question 13. The FTC has not pursued any enforcement activity under
the Military Lending Act, despite having the authority to enforce this
important protection. If confirmed, would you support vigorous
enforcement of the MLA?
Answer. If confirmed, I will vigorously enforce all laws and rules
within the jurisdiction of the FTC, including the Military Lending Act.
______
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to
Christine S. Wilson
Question 1. The February 2013, the Federal Trade Commission
published a report that found that five percent of consumers had errors
on their credit reports that could result in less favorable terms for
loans.
Based on that study, do you think the consumer reporting agencies
(CRAs) comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)'s requirement
to ``follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy''
of credit reports? (15 USC 1681e(b))
Do you think the FTC should conduct a follow up study to see if
error rates have improved?
If error rates continue to impact millions of Americans, what
actions should the FTC take to enforce compliance with the FCRA?
Answer. The FCRA, originally passed in 1970 to prevent misuse of
consumer information in insurance, employment, and credit transactions,
is an important consumer protection statute. The Act allows use of
credit information for ``permissible purposes'' that benefit consumers
and requires notice to consumers when ``adverse actions'' are based on
a credit report, enabling consumers to verify the accuracy of the
information. The FTC played a key role in the reauthorization of the
statute in the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act (``FACTA'') in
2003 that strengthened consumer protections, particularly against
identity theft.
I have not had an opportunity to review the referenced study and
the analysis and data underlying its conclusions, but look forward to
doing so if confirmed. In conjunction with FTC staff familiar with the
methodology and findings of the study, I will work with my colleagues
on the Commission and other relevant agencies (including the CFPB) to
understand the sources of errors on credit reports and the best ways to
lower error rates, clearly an important goal. An additional study may
be useful to advance this process, and additional enforcement may be
justified by the facts uncovered during this process.
Question 2. Do you think the policies and practices of CRAs to
handle consumer disputes are in compliance with the FCRA?
Answer. I do not have information sufficient to evaluate the facts
and provide an informed answer to this question. If confirmed, I will
consult with FTC staff and my colleagues on the Commission to determine
whether the policies and practices of the CRAs are in compliance with
the FCRA, other laws, and relevant orders, and take appropriate actions
based on that evaluation.
Question 3. In 2015, the New York Attorney General reached a
groundbreaking settlement with the three national consumer reporting
agencies--Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. The terms of the
settlement require the CRAs to do more to ensure maximum possible
accuracy of credit reports and to improve the dispute resolution
process for consumers.
Do you think the terms of the settlement regarding dispute
resolution represent best practices for CRAs' compliance with the
FCRA's requirement that CRAs conduct a ``reasonable reinvestigation''
if the consumer disputes the accuracy of the information in his or her
credit report? (15 USC 1681i)
Can the FTC use its current authorities to hold CRAs to higher
standards when it comes to handling consumer disputes?
Answer. I have not had an opportunity to review the terms of the
referenced settlement and how its provisions relate to the requirements
of the FCRA. If confirmed, I will consult with FTC staff and my
colleagues on the Commission (and the New York State AG's Office, as
appropriate) to understand the extent to which the settlement could be
viewed as a set of best practices for FCRA purposes, and to assess
whether the FTC has the authority to hold the CRAs to higher standards.
Question 4. What are your views on the adequacy of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act enforcement regime?
Answer. During my tenure as Chief of Staff to Chairman Muris, the
FTC undertook enforcement actions for order violations by CRAs. More
recently, though, I have not had an opportunity to study this issue. If
confirmed, I will consult with FTC staff and my colleagues on the
Commission regarding the adequacy of the FCRA enforcement regime.
Should the FTC need additional tools or resources, in conjunction with
my fellow Commissioners, I would enter into a discussion with Congress.
Question 5. What are your views on the inclusion of medical debt in
credit reports?
Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to consulting with FTC staff
and my colleagues on the Commission regarding the kinds of debts that
should be reflected in credit reports, as well as opportunities for
CRAs to monitor the accuracy of information submitted by furnishers, so
as to provide accurate information to potential lenders while
preserving the intended consumer protections of the FCRA and Section 5
of the FTC Act.
Question 6. Consumers have the right to inspect their credit
reports every year. Do you think they should also have the right to
inspect their credit score?
Answer. It is my understanding that some companies provide credit
scores to existing customers, and others offer credit scores free of
charge to any consumer. If confirmed, I look forward to consulting with
FTC staff and my colleagues on the Commission regarding the bundle of
consumer rights necessary to preserve the intended consumer protections
of the FCRA and Section 5 of the FTC Act.
Question 7. Do you think the credit reporting market is functioning
well? In your view, what areas could be improved?
Answer. The credit reporting market serves the important goal of
enabling consumers to smooth income streams over time. CRAs have
assumed a vital role in assembling complex data and evaluating consumer
credit and other information on consumers. To effectively capitalize on
the benefits of credit, the credit reporting market must function well,
which in turn requires lenders to have access to fair and accurate
credit reporting. If confirmed, I look forward to consulting with FTC
staff and my fellow Commissioners regarding how effectively the market
is working today and what steps the FTC can take to improve its
effectiveness.
Question 8. Do you think it is sound public policy for consumers to
have to pay to freeze their credit report?
Answer. I have not had an opportunity to consider this issue. If
confirmed, I look forward to consulting with FTC staff and my
colleagues on the Commission regarding how this issue fits into the
larger context of the intended consumer protections of the FCRA and
Section 5 of the FTC Act.
Question 9. Do you think it is confusing for consumers to
understand the difference between freezes, which are defined by and
regulated under state law, and the CRAs' various ``lock'' products,
which fall outside of the protection of state law?
Answer. I have not had an opportunity to consider this issue. If
confirmed, I look forward to consulting with FTC staff and my
colleagues on the Commission regarding the various products offered by
the CRAs, how those are analyzed under state and Federal law, any
resulting disconnects, and appropriate next steps to reduce any
existing consumer confusion. The FTC's consumer education platform is
robust and likely could be useful in addressing any consumer confusion
in this area.
Question 10. Should the FTC have the authority to ensure compliance
with the Safeguards Rule?
Answer. In conjunction with implementing the Gramm-Leach-Bliley
Act, the FTC issued the Safeguards Rule. This rule, issued during my
tenure as Chairman Muris' Chief of Staff, requires financial
institutions under FTC jurisdiction to have measures in place to keep
customer information secure. Since its issuance, the FTC has conducted
important enforcement efforts pursuant to this rule, including its
recent action against TaxSlayer. If confirmed, I would consult with FTC
staff and my colleagues on the Commission to determine the status of
the rule, and whether revisions (including to the FTC's scope of
authority) would be appropriate. I would support FTC discussions with
Congress, if appropriate, regarding the FTC's scope of authority.
Question 11. Do you think the FTC has the right expertise and
capacity to investigate and evaluate algorithms for unfair, deceptive,
fraudulent consumer practices in the marketplace?
Answer. I appreciate the discussions we had on this issue before
the Feb. 14, 2018 confirmation hearing and at the hearing itself. I
have had an opportunity to review some publicly available materials
regarding the FTC's research in this area. If confirmed, I would talk
with FTC staff and my colleagues on the Commission regarding the FTC's
capacity and expertise in this arena. To the extent unfair and/or
deceptive practices are occurring within the scope of the FTC's
jurisdiction, I would support enforcement actions. And to the extent
additional resources and/or tools are required to reach relevant
conduct, in conjunction with my colleagues on the Commission, I would
support a dialogue with Congress.
Question 12. Will you prioritize bringing in additional technical
talent to strengthen FTC's mission in the digital domain?
Answer. As an increasing portion of the U.S. economy has moved
online, the FTC has taken corresponding steps to increase its
capabilities in this arena. For example, the FTC now has a Chief
Technologist whose role is to advise the Commission on technology
matters, including the FTC's use of technology, technical aspects of
law enforcement actions, and technology policy recommendations. If
confirmed, I would support efforts to ensure that the FTC has the
resources and expertise necessary to carry out its mission effectively,
including as it relates to the digital domain. To the extent additional
resources and/or tools are required to reach relevant conduct, in
conjunction with my colleagues on the Commission, I would welcome a
discussion with Congress.
Question 13. What are your views of the FTC's ability to ensure
adequate oversight of online privacy? Please include your perspective
on the FTC's expertise and the adequacy of the regulatory tools
available to it. What specific actions would you propose the FTC
undertake to improve online privacy?
Answer. During my tenure as FTC Chief of Staff, the FTC spent a
great deal of time on (and established important precedents with
respect to) online privacy issues. Both before and since that period,
the FTC has been quite active in, and consequently has developed
significant expertise regarding, the issues in this arena. Moreover,
the FTC has a variety of tools at its disposal, including the FTC Act
and COPPA as well as a robust consumer and business education platform.
If confirmed, I would discuss with FTC staff and my fellow
Commissioners the additional actions that constructively could be taken
in this arena, and what additional authority and tools may be required.
If appropriate, and in conjunction with my colleagues on the
Commission, I would welcome a discussion regarding any additional
authority and tools necessary to effectively fulfill the FTC's mission
in this important space.
Question 14. The FCC's Net Neutrality order is premised upon ISPs
disclosing voluntary policies and the FTC enforcing compliance with
those polices. Do you agree that the FTC's authority only extends to
enforcing a company's compliance with whatever policy the company
issues? If not, please explain.
If the Ninth Circuit's decision in FTC v. AT&T Mobility is allowed
to stand, what authority, if any, will the FTC retain to enforce these
company policies?
Answer. The extent of the FTC's authority over common carriers will
be determined by the courts and Congress. If the FTC has jurisdiction,
and if I am confirmed, I will coordinate with FTC staff and my
colleagues on the Commission to ensure full and effective enforcement
of all applicable laws within the FTC's jurisdiction, including those
with respect to unfair and/or deceptive acts undertaken by ISPs.
Furthermore, I will work with FTC staff and my colleagues on the
Commission to identify any additional resources that may be necessary
and will consult with Congress accordingly.
Question 15. What is your view of the propriety of the FTC imposing
conditions on proposed mergers as compared with suing to block a deal?
How would you evaluate when to use one or the other?
Answer. Merger remedies usefully can be employed when they are
capable of preserving competition that otherwise would be lost by
virtue of a proposed merger. But some proposed mergers may threaten to
substantially lessen competition in ways that cannot be remedied. In
those instances, suing to block would be appropriate. As Mr. Simons and
I both discussed during our confirmation hearing, it will be important
for the FTC to conduct detailed merger retrospectives to determine
whether prior agency decisions to clear or block mergers (with and
without remedies) produced the intended results. Those findings can
then be used to determine whether merger policy changes are warranted.
______
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tom Udall to
Christine S. Wilson
Question 1. What are your ideas how to promote consumer protection
in an increasingly online--and connected--world?
Answer. Ensuring consumer protection in an increasingly online and
connected world will require a multi-pronged approach. Among other
things, the FTC will need to ensure that it is staying abreast of (or
ahead of) the technological capabilities of bad actors. It will need to
closely monitor developments in the marketplace, including through (1)
collaboration with other federal, state, and foreign agencies, (2) the
feedback of honest industry participants, and (3) careful analysis of
consumer complaints. And it will need to work closely with other law
enforcement agencies, both in the U.S. and abroad, to bring bad actors
to justice. This set of tasks is complex and challenging. If confirmed,
I will work with FTC staff and my colleagues on the Commission to
identify any additional resources that may be necessary and will
consult with Congress accordingly.
Question 2. Do you believe that the current FTC enforcement
principles are sufficient to protect consumers? And do you believe the
FTC has the resources necessary to protect consumers given the
significant amount of work on the docket for the agency?
Answer. Yes, I believe that the FTC's enforcement authority under
Section 5 of the FTC Act and other laws, together with corresponding
precedent, is sufficient to protect consumers. That said, if confirmed,
I will work with FTC staff and my colleagues on the Commission to
identify any additional tools, resources and/or authority that may be
necessary and will consult with Congress accordingly.
Question 3. In December, I wrote to the FTC, along with Senators
Schumer and Blumenthal, asking for a workshop to discuss the increased
use of ``bots'' to purchase large quantities of in-demand toys and
items, particularly at Christmas. The FTC has confirmed that it will
engage with key stakeholders to determine if a workshop is necessary.
Will you commit to reviewing the record on this issue and to working
with my office to determine next steps, including the possibility of
legislation?
Answer. Yes.
Question 4. Last week, an article in TechCrunch showed how Facebook
uses data from Onavo Protect, a subsidiary app, to gather data on its
competitors; how Google uses its search rankings to demote alternate
competitive sites; and Amazon's aggressive low pricing undercuts book
publishers. Under your respective leadership, how will the FTC enforce
the principles of unfair methods of competition against tech giants
like Facebook, Google and Amazon to promote consumer welfare?
Answer. If confirmed as a Commissioner, within the jurisdiction of
the FTC, I will follow the facts where they lead without regard to the
identity or size of the company at issue. No entity is or should be
above the law. Thus, for both competition and consumer protection
issues, tech giants will be subject to the same ``rules of the road''
that the FTC applies to every other company.
Question 5. Following the FTC's approval of the Google/DoubleClick
acquisition in 2007, then Commissioner Pamela Jones Harbor released a
dissent detailing the need for the commission to ``evaluate the
implication of this kind of data merger from a competition as well as a
consumer protection perspective.'' As commissioner, how would you use
this framing of data mergers in evaluating mergers and acquisitions in
the technology industry?
Answer. The analytical framework used for evaluating the likely
competitive effects of mergers is broad and flexible. Thus, mergers
involving technology companies should be evaluated in essentially the
same way as other mergers. Namely, the reviewing agency should ask
whether the proposed merger will inhibit competition in any way,
including by raising prices, reducing output, limiting choice,
decreasing quality, weakening privacy protections, or constraining
innovation. If careful analysis of these factors reveals that a
proposed merger is likely to substantially lessen competition, then the
merger should be subject to enforcement action.
As Mr. Simons and I both discussed during our confirmation hearing,
it will be important for the FTC to conduct detailed merger
retrospectives to determine whether prior agency decisions to clear or
block mergers, including those in the technology sector, produced the
intended results. Those findings can then be used to determine whether
merger policy changes are warranted.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to
Christine S. Wilson
Question 1. When Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act in 2004 it helped reduce barriers to retail competition
in the contact lens market and led to lower prices for consumers.
However, contact retailers sometimes sell patients contact lenses after
the prescription has expired or fail to adequately verify the
prescription in accordance to FCLCA. In some cases, this has led to
dangerous eye and health conditions for the patient. How can the FTC
work in coordination with the FDA, CDC and other Federal agencies to
make sure contact lens patients are receiving high quality care and
safe contact lenses?
Answer. The FTC has a rich history of working collaboratively with
sister Federal agencies to ensure that their expertise is reflected in
FTC policies. If these agencies have information relevant to the FCLCA
and any proposed revisions, if confirmed, I will encourage FTC staff to
coordinate with other relevant agencies as appropriate to ensure that
issues pertaining to patient safety are given due consideration.
Question 2. In December 2016, the FTC issued a proposed change to
the current Contact Lens Rule that mandated that all eye doctors obtain
a signed acknowledgement form from each of their contact lens patients
when they receive a copy of their prescription. Do you know of any
other ways for patients to understand their right to their contact lens
prescription that would be just as, if not, more effective than a
written acknowledgement?
Answer. My understanding is that the FTC has received and is
analyzing thousands of comments on this and related issues, and is
holding a workshop in March on this topic. If confirmed, I will work
with FTC staff to understand the nature of the feedback received from
consumers, industry, and others regarding how best to promote
competition while preserving patient safety, including alternate
mechanisms to notify consumers of their rights under the Contact Lens
Rule. I will then coordinate with my colleagues on the Commission to
move forward accordingly.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
to Christine S. Wilson
Question 1. Restoring Internet Freedom FCC-FTC MOU
Within the net neutrality MOU, signed between the FCC and FTC,
regarding the FTC's authority it states: ``Congress has directed the
FTC to, among other things, prevent unfair methods of competition and
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.''
Therefore, can you say without reservation that you'll have what
you will need, upon being confirmed at the FTC, to actually catch
improper actions taken by Internet service providers toward consumers?
Answer. Until the FCC reclassified broadband as a common carrier
service under Title II of the Communications Act in 2015, Internet
service providers (ISPs) fell within the jurisdiction of the FTC. In
its July 17, 2017 submission to the FCC, FTC staff noted that before
this reclassification, the FTC used its consumer protection authority
to protect broadband consumers, including in matters pertaining to the
advertising, marketing, and billing of broadband services and those
concerning privacy and data security. FTC staff noted in the same
submission that, before this reclassification, the FTC also used its
competition authority to protect consumers and the competitive process
in Internet and Internet-related markets. FTC staff further noted that
even today, the FTC is using its jurisdiction to address practices
similar to those of concern in the net neutrality space.
Based on this lengthy historical expertise, I believe the FTC has
the tools and expertise necessary to identify and act upon improper
actions taken by ISPs toward consumers. If confirmed, and if the FTC
has jurisdiction, I will coordinate with FTC staff and my colleagues on
the Commission to identify any additional resources that may be
necessary and will consult with Congress accordingly.
Question 2. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
Unfortunately we still don't know the full FTC authority over
common carriers, like in the case pending on AT&T, so I would like to
hear what you anticipate will be FTC's authority going forward.
Answer. The extent of the FTC's authority over common carriers will
be determined by the courts and Congress. If the FTC has jurisdiction,
and if I am confirmed, I will coordinate with FTC staff and my
colleagues on the Commission to ensure full and effective enforcement
of all applicable laws within the FTC's jurisdiction. Furthermore, I
will work with FTC staff and my colleagues on the Commission to
identify any additional resources that may be necessary and will
consult with Congress accordingly.
Question 3. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
How you can ensure the FTC will even have the authority to enforce
the limited principles covered in Chairman Pai's weak form of net
neutrality?
Answer. As noted above, the extent of the FTC's authority over
common carriers will be determined by the courts and Congress. If
confirmed, I would support an FTC dialogue with Congress, if
appropriate, regarding the proper scope of that authority.
Question 4. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
And I would ask if you can provide me a true commitment to act on
behalf of consumers who are impacted by less than fair practices by
some in the telecommunications industry.
Answer. If confirmed, yes, as to conduct falling within the
jurisdiction of the FTC and in conjunction with FTC staff and other
Commissioners.
Question 5. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
Can you please define for me what the lead telecommunications
policy expert Federal agency is, in your opinion?
Answer. The Federal Communications Commission is responsible for
implementing and enforcing America's communications law and
regulations. The FTC is charged with enforcing the FTC Act and many
other laws governing competition and consumer protection. The FCC and
the FTC shared jurisdiction over ISPs prior to the reclassification of
broadband in 2015, and the FTC actively enforced competition and
consumer protection laws against ISPs during this period. Moreover, the
FTC coordinated closely with the FCC to implement the Do Not Call List
under Chairmen Muris and Powell. Shared jurisdiction between sector-
specific regulators and competition/consumer protection authorities
appears in other industries, and can be an effective force for ensuring
that consumers are protected and markets are operating efficiently.
Question 6. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
Have you specifically recently read the MOU on net neutrality
between the FCC and FTC, and do you support it in its entirety?
Answer. I have reviewed the FTC/FCC MOU. As in other instances in
which a sectoral regulator shares jurisdiction and works closely with a
consumer protection/competition authority, this MOU appears to create a
cooperative framework that capitalizes on the strengths and expertise
of each agency for the benefit of American consumers. As noted above,
my experience in the joint efforts of the FTC and FCC to implement the
Do Not Call initiative has led me to believe that constructive
cooperation of this type does enhance the public interest. If
confirmed, I will fully support the MOU's implementation. Of course, I
would want to discuss the MOU with FTC staff and my colleagues on the
Commission to determine whether any revisions would further enhance the
cooperative framework and benefit the American public.
Question 7. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
What is your understanding of the capacity of the staff currently
at the FTC, and do you think you can effectively execute this agreement
enough to garner true public trust in ensuring a truly free and open
internet?
Answer. My understanding is that total FTC staff levels are roughly
similar to FTC staff levels prior to the 2015 reclassification. In
comments submitted to the FCC, FTC staff described the robust
enforcement efforts undertaken with respect to ISPs and the Internet
prior to reclassification. Thus, my general sense based on public
knowledge is that--all other things being equal--if the FTC is
effectively deploying its resources, it likely has the capacity to
effectively implement the MOU. If confirmed, I would consult with FTC
staff regarding their capacity and whether any additional resources or
tools would be required to execute this agreement fully.
Question 8. Broadband Internet Speed Honesty
I am aware that various state Attorneys General are concerned that
a telecomm industry petition to the FCC on cost transparency, related
to the advertisement of Internet speeds, quote ``represents nothing
more than the industry's effort to shield itself from state law
enforcement.''
Given the FTC's mission regarding deceptive practices, can you
speak to your perspective on whether this is fair consumer protection
issue to be concerned about at FTC, given the prices and promises ISPs
make to generate more business?
Answer. I have not studied the referenced petition to the FCC. That
said, if the FTC has jurisdiction over ISPs, it would be appropriate
for the FTC to analyze whether the advertisements and business
practices of ISPs are lawful under Section 5 of the FTC Act, and to
take action when they are not.
Question 9. FTC Investigation on GPS Tracking of Vehicles
Last year it was revealed that the Federal Trade Commission is
investigating GPS tracking technologies used in the subprime auto loan
industry, but my understanding is that no findings or rulings have been
released. Going back as far 2014, the New York Times had highlighted
this as a concern. In their piece, they highlighted a troubling story
of a mother in Las Vegas, Mary Bolender, who needed to get her child
with a 103.5-degree fever to the ER, but her 2005 Chrysler van wouldn't
start. As the piece says--``The cause was not a mechanical problem--it
was her lender.''
Now I have a number of concerns with their as a business practice,
but can I get a commitment from you to continue to look into this issue
and publically provide information on your findings and enforcement
determinations in a timely manner?
Answer. Public materials indicate the FTC has undertaken some work
on this issue. If confirmed, I will consult with FTC staff and my
colleagues on the Commission to determine the extent to which findings
and determinations can be disclosed regarding the FTC's work in this
area, and also to ascertain whether additional analysis and/or
enforcement would be appropriate.
Question 10. Franchise Business Oversight
The FTC has jurisdiction over franchise businesses. In my state, I
have heard complaints from Subway franchisees that the Franchise
Disclosure Document is written in favor of the franchisor in a way that
can undermine their ability to succeed. Nevada's neighboring state of
California has passed a bill protecting franchisees.
How can the FTC expand protections for franchisees so they can
financially succeed?
Answer. The FTC enforces the Franchise Rule (adopted in 1979 and
most recently amended in 2008), which is designed to give prospective
purchasers of franchises the material information they need in order to
weigh the risks and benefits of such an investment. If confirmed, I
would consult with FTC staff and my colleagues on the Commission
regarding the state of the Franchise Rule and its enforcement, and to
determine whether additional steps (whether rule revisions,
enforcement, or other actions) are warranted and within the
jurisdiction of the FTC.
Question 11. Mortgage Closing Fraud
Thieves have been targeting mortgage closings, where they break
into a realtor or title company's e-mail accounts. Then, they tell the
homebuyer to wire money they have saved and borrowed to a bank account
owned by the thieves.
How do you think the FTC can work with the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau to prevent these types of scams?
Answer. With respect to this question, and to the two following
questions: Deceptive or unfair practices with respect to mortgage
closing fraud, reverse mortgages, and debt collection present
significant concerns. Under its own authority, and in close cooperation
with the CFPB pursuant to the FTC/CFPB MOU, the FTC should continue to
pursue these issues vigorously. Furthermore, the FTC's consumer
education expertise should continue to be brought to bear on these and
other important issues in the financial services space.
Question 12. Reverse Mortgages
Reverse mortgages are products sold to seniors to help them ``age-
in-place'' and use their home equity as a means by which to responsibly
pay their bills. Reverse mortgages can be sensible products, but
sometimes have been falsely advertised to seniors. The FTC and the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau conducted a ``sweep'' of reverse
mortgage advertisements, and a review of consumer complaints, and found
that three reverse mortgage companies engaged in deceptive advertising
which misled consumers.
Given the overlapping jurisdictions between the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau and the FTC, can you discuss how you envision the two
entities work together to combat financial fraud, specifically scams
impacting seniors?
Answer. Please see above.
Question 13. Debt Collection
Debt collectors generate more complaints to the FTC than any other
industry. And in recent years, the CFPB has noted that debt collection
remains the top complaint received by the Bureau from older Americans.
Specifically, the Consumer Bureau identified several issues related to
debt collection and seniors, including hounding calls, harassment and
threats of impermissible Social Security garnishment.
How do you think the FTC could work with the CFPB to bring more
rules-of-the road to this part of the financial services marketplace to
protect consumers--particularly seniors--from fraudulent practices?
Answer. Please see above.
Question 14. Merger Review Commitment
With increased multi-industry players growing in prominence by
acquiring more businesses outside their core business model, can you
commit to reviewing the horizontal merger guidelines, which have not
directly addressed vertical mergers since 1984?
Answer. As Mr. Simons and I both discussed during our confirmation
hearing, it will be important for the FTC to conduct detailed merger
retrospectives to determine whether prior agency decisions to clear
mergers (with and without remedies) adequately preserved competition
and protected consumers. Using those findings, it would then be
appropriate to determine whether policy changes are warranted with
respect to mergers of all types.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Roger F. Wicker to
Noah Joshua Phillips
Question 1. Many online companies are engaging in targeted
advertising. Using consumer data, companies can target what they deem
to be the most relevant ads to consumers. Should there be more
transparency into how the algorithms behind targeted advertising work
so that consumers can see how they are being targeted for certain
messages?
Answer. Enhancing the ability of advertisers to reach consumers who
have a higher likelihood of wanting to purchase particular products can
benefit both consumers and advertisers, but consumers are rightly
interested in the means by which they are reached. If confirmed, I
would be willing to explore this question with my colleagues and career
staff.
Question 2. Would third party audits of algorithms be a reasonable
way to ensure the algorithms are doing what companies claim and not
harming competition or consumer choice? Is this something the FTC might
consider looking into?
Answer. In my oral testimony before the Committee, I discussed the
need of the FTC to keep abreast of trends in technology and business
practices. The increasing use of algorithms in determining pricing and
other questions is a good example of a trend that, I believe, the FTC
needs to monitor closely. If confirmed, I would be interested in
looking into this issue, including the question whether the audits you
mention are a reasonable way to protect consumers and promote
competition.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to
Noah Joshua Phillips
Question 1. As a former Attorney General of Alaska, I always
appreciated coordination with Federal agencies where appropriate, and
the opportunity to communicate solutions that made the most sense for
Alaskans. Given the importance of state attorneys general to the FTC's
antitrust enforcement, please describe your views on the working
relationship between the FTC and state attorneys general.
Answer. My view is that State Attorneys General can be a ``force
multiplier'' to help the FTC deal with those who violate the law, and
that they provide indispensable information about what is going on in
their respective states. I believe that coordination between the FTC
and State Attorneys General is important to the agency's mission.
Question 2. As you know, the state I represent is unique which
means its problems are unique and require unconventional solutions. In
a highly rural state like Alaska, many communities are not connected by
roads, challenging weather conditions prohibit timely delivery of mail
and other essential services, and quality connectivity is considered a
luxury. One of your objectives at the Commission is consumer protection
and education. How will you ensure that rural constituents like mine
have the tools they need to make informed decisions and in cases of
abuse that require follow up, for example data breaches or identity
theft, the information necessary to mitigate risks and resolve the
issue?
Answer. The consumer protection mission of the FTC extends to all
Americans, whoever they are and wherever they live; and consumer
education is an important part of that. If confirmed, I will work with
staff and my colleagues to examine the FTC's performance of its
objectives in rural areas, including Alaska. I would also look forward
to working with your office on how the FTC can better serve Alaskans.
Question 3. In your prepared statement, you discuss anticompetitive
consolidation, which immediately called to mind the enormous market
capitalization of tech companies. Recent calculations value the four
largest tech companies' capitalization at $2.8 trillion dollars, which
is a staggering 24 percent of the S&P 500 Top 50, close to the value of
every stock traded on the Nasdaq in 2001, and to give a different
perspective, approximately the same amount as France's current GDP.
Press reports have also noted allegations of increased anti-competitive
behavior by some of these companies. Is there a point at which these
companies are simply too big from an antitrust standpoint?
Answer. Like many Americans, I experience daily the profound impact
these companies have on my life and the lives of those around me. Their
size and scope is remarkable. Under our antitrust laws, size is not, in
and of itself, a cause for concern. It may reflect success in providing
consumers with products and services that they value, improving their
welfare. But growth or the maintenance of market power through
anticompetitive conduct can violate the law and hurt consumers, and the
FTC has an important role to play in enforcing the law. That no one--
and no corporation, no matter how large--is above the law is a bedrock
principle of American justice. I believe the FTC should apply the law
fairly and carefully, no matter who may be violating it.

Response to Written Question Submitted by Hon. Dean Heller to
Noah Joshua Phillips
Question. When Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act in 2003, it was a pro-consumer measure that ensured
consumers automatically receive a copy of his or her prescription after
an eye exam--without having to ask for it, pay an additional fee, or
sign a waiver. Do you agree that consumers should receive copies of
their prescriptions as Congress intended so that they can use the
prescription to purchase their contact lenses from a source of their
choosing?
Answer. Our constitutional system gives it to Congress to write the
laws and the Executive Branch--including the FTC--to enforce them. The
FTC should always strive to give effect to the intent of Congress, as
reflected in the text of the laws it passes. As a consumer, I have
certainly found it beneficial to be able to take my eyeglass
prescriptions with me. As a nominee, I have not studied the Contact
Lens Rule in depth. I do understand that the agency has received
substantial input from a wide variety of stakeholders over several
years, and is convening a workshop next month on the ongoing review of
the Rule. If confirmed, I look forward to working with staff and my
colleagues to review the results of that work to determine the best
course forward as the FTC reviews the Contact Lens Rule.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Bill Nelson to
Noah Joshua Phillips
Question 1. The FTC is a relatively small agency that has to
effectively use its resources to cover a very broad jurisdiction. In
this regard, as a matter of discretion, it may be wise for the FTC to
pursue enforcement cases involving practices that result in substantial
harm. However, substantial harm is not a legal requirement under
section five of the FTC Act--cases involving deception do not require
harm at all, and cases involving unfairness can involve harm that is
prospective and/or non-financial. Consequently, it is very important
that commissioners do not stringently require types of harm as a legal
test for agency enforcement actions. This principle is particularly
important because Lab MD is challenging the FTC's legal authority to
bring enforcement actions for data breaches based on the lack of
requisite harm. As a commissioner, will you pledge to not require
substantial harm or financial harm as legal tests for FTC enforcement
actions?
Answer. If confirmed, I pledge to enforce the FTC Act as written,
and consistent with legal precedent. Section 45(n) requires
``substantial injury'' in unfairness cases, but not deception cases. My
understanding is that ``substantial injury'' is not limited
specifically to financial harms.
Under the FTC's 1983 Policy Statement on Deception, the Commission
will find deception ``if there is a representation, omission or
practice that is likely to mislead the consumer acting reasonably in
the circumstances, to the consumer's detriment.'' As the Policy
Statement notes, the representation, omission or practice must be
material.
Question 2. The FTC's Bureau of Economics provides valuable insight
and analysis that supplements the FTC's work. However, the FTC is,
first and foremost, a law enforcement agency, not a regulatory agency.
As such, economic analysis should play a complementary role, not a
dispositive one. The FTC should enforce the FTC Act and the other laws
under its jurisdiction according to legal doctrine, not economic
analyses. As a commissioner, will you pledge to continue to further the
FTC as a law enforcement agency in which the Bureau of Economics and
economic analyses play a complimentary role, not a dispositive role?
Will you pledge to enforce the law according to legal precedent?
Answer. I agree that the FTC's Bureau of Economics provides
valuable insight and analysis, which plays an integral role in and
supplements the FTC's work. If confirmed, I pledge to enforce the law
according to legal precedent.
Question 3. Piracy continues to be a problem that plagues content
providers. The Internet is filled with websites that provide pirated
content and entertainment at the expense of the companies that produce
the content. Moreover, many of these websites can harm consumers with
unsafe or even fraudulent data and commercial practices. What can the
FTC do to crack down on the illegal piracy of American entertainment
and content?
Answer. The FTC is one of several Federal agencies that can deal
with content piracy and the bad practices that sometimes attend it. The
FTC can enforce the laws Congress has charged it with enforcing and
engage in consumer and business education. The FTC has in the past
conducted workshops dealing with malware-related issues, and maintains
online outreach on them. The Commission also has brought enforcement
actions against companies that surreptitiously downloaded such computer
programs onto consumers' computers.
Question 4. Fraudulent websites can deceive consumers by
masquerading as legitimate hotel websites. Consumers who are fooled by
these sites reserve rooms that do not exist or turn out to be different
from what they reserved online. According to industry statistics, this
particular fraud affects millions of consumers a year and costs the
hotel industry hundreds of millions of dollars. I wrote former FTC
Chairwoman Edith Ramirez about this issue in June 2015. Will you pledge
to ensure that the FTC will work with other law enforcement entities
(such as state attorneys general) to bring enforcement actions against
fraudulent hotel websites?
Answer. I believe that the FTC should work with other law
enforcement entities, including State Attorneys General where
appropriate. If confirmed, I will support the FTC's efforts to work
with other law enforcement agencies, including State AGs, to address
practices that are unfair or deceptive within the meaning of the FTC
Act, including fraudulent hotel websites.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Richard Blumenthal to
Noah Joshua Phillips
Question 1. What experience do you have working with State
Attorneys General? What are your views regarding the Commission working
with state law enforcement?
Answer. Other than in my capacity as a Senate staffer, I do not
have personal experience working with State Attorneys General. My
general view is that they can be a ``force multiplier'' to help the FTC
deal with those who violate the law, and that they provide
indispensable information about what is going on in their respective
states.
Question 2. In the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, Congress gave the FTC
extensive authority over the sale, servicing, and leasing of
automobiles--charging it to protect consumers from abusive auto lending
practices and granting it exclusive authority to draft rules governing
unfair or deceptive acts or practices by automobile dealers. Would you
support the FTC using its rulemaking authority to rein in unfair or
deceptive acts or practices by automobile dealers?
Answer. As a nominee, I have not studied this question. If
confirmed, I would be open to consulting with my colleagues and staff
on it.
Question 3. More than 17 million Americans are the victims of
identity theft every year. This problem seems to increase year over
year as identity theft scams seem to get more sophisticated.
Three years ago, the FTC established IdentityTheft.gov. This site
is supposed to be a one-stop shop for victims of identity theft where
they can easily freeze credit across the big three credit reporting
agencies, and recover their stolen identities.
This website's functionality is limited, however, because of what
appears to be a lack of engagement by the credit bureaus to make the
site what it should be.
How would you engage with credit bureaus to ensure
IdentityTheft.gov has a comprehensive suite of easy to use tools
allowing victims of identity theft to recover as quickly as possible,
with as little stress as possible? What are your expectations with
respect to the role the credit reporting agencies should play in making
IdentityTheft.gov an effective one-stop shop for identity theft
victims?
Answer. If confirmed, I look forward to consulting with my
colleagues and career staff at the FTC regarding both IdentityTheft.com
itself and the role that credit bureaus are playing--or not playing--in
its success. My expectation is that those agencies will abide by legal
obligations and commitments made to the FTC.
Question 4. Would you support FTC's jurisdiction be expanded to
include non-profits and charities so that it can act more swiftly to
prevent and stop illegal conduct in the nonprofit sector?
Answer. I understand the important arguments in favor of expanding
the FTC's jurisdiction to include non-profits and charities. Before
taking a position on the issue, however, I would consult with my fellow
commissioners, career staff and members of Congress. I am interested in
your view on this issue.
Question 5. Other Federal agencies charged with consumer protection
make an array of data available on consumer complaints received. The
FTC releases relatively very little data on companies receiving
significant levels of complaints. Do you think the FTC should be more
transparent about the complaints it receives?
Answer. I think transparency is an important virtue in government,
and over the course of my Senate career have worked to improve laws
like the Freedom of Information Act. If confirmed, I would consult with
my colleagues and career staff to examine the FTC's practices with
respect to publishing data on consumer complaints and, if warranted,
support more transparency.
Question 6. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created in
response to the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession after it
became clear that our financial sector needed far more oversight to
prevent a disaster of that magnitude from happening ever again. The
current Administration seems intent on gutting this agency that serves
a critical role in protecting Americans from irresponsible financial
institutions. Of course, the CFPB and the FTC complement each other in
their protection of consumers. How do you envision the FTC's role in
holding financial institutions accountable?
Answer. Where financial institutions are subject to the
jurisdiction of the FTC, I envision the agency enforcing the FTC Act,
FCRA, FDCPA and other laws Congress has charged it with enforcing
against them, where the facts and law warrant that enforcement. If
confirmed, working with my colleagues, I would support such
enforcement. The FTC and CFPB share responsibility for the enforcement
of certain statutes, including ones that apply to financial
institutions. The relationship between the two agencies is governed
currently by a memorandum of understanding (MOU). The FTC should
evaluate whether the MOU facilitates the optimal coordination between
the agencies, and, if confirmed, I commit to working with my fellow
commissioners to do so.
Question 7. Other consumer protection agencies appear to be
reducing the vigor of their enforcement work. In what way should this
impact the priorities of the FTC?
Answer. Our constitutional system gives it to Congress to write the
laws and the Executive Branch--including the FTC--to enforce them. The
FTC should thus be committed to the vigorous enforcement of the laws
Congress has charged it to enforce, and that commitment should not be
diminished by the decisions of other consumer protection agencies,
whatever those decisions are. Where the FTC has authority and laws that
fall under it are being violated, the FTC should be willing to enforce
the law even if other agencies do not.
Question 8. In the past, the FTC has cracked down on for-profit
colleges and vocational programs with strong enforcement actions.
However, we're seeing these institutions continue to defraud Americans.
A study conducted by The Century Foundation found that 98 percent of
complaints asking for student loan forgiveness alleging fraud by
colleges were from students attending for-profit institutions. If
confirmed, how will you protect Americans from being scammed by such
institutions?
Answer. The FTC has indeed brought enforcement actions against for-
profit educational institutions, where they have violated the laws
Congress has charged the agency to enforce. If confirmed, I would
support continued enforcement of those laws, where the facts and the
law warranted that enforcement. I also believe that the FTC's consumer
education capabilities can be leveraged to help students make informed
choices about their education and avoid being defrauded.
Question 9. More than two of every three American households own a
pet. The FTC has estimated they will spend $10.2 billion on medications
this year, of which more than $5 billion require a prescription. It has
been estimated that pet owners who can get a copy of their pet's
prescription and shop around, could save 20 to 30 percent on branded
medications and 50 percent when they purchase generics. This suggests
that prescription portability can save pet owners billions of dollars
every year--in addition to the savings in time and transportation if
they can get those prescriptions filled while they are at the grocery
store or pharmacy or delivered from an online pharmacy. Unlike with
human medications, with our pets, the prescriber also dispenses the
medication prescribed--setting up a conflict of interest whereby the
prescriber is both a health care provider and a retailer.
In testimony in 2016, the FTC stated that ``we believe that the
greater prescription portability likely would enhance competition for
the sale of pet medications and that consumers would benefit from this
competition in the form of lower prices.'' Do you agree with this
conclusion?
Answer. As a nominee, I have not reviewed that testimony, or
familiarized myself with the underlying factual record. That said, I
agree generally that keeping markets (such as those for pet
prescriptions) open and competitive is good for consumers. If
confirmed, I plan to familiarize myself with this issue and consult
with my colleagues, career staff and you and other interested members
of Congress on that question.
Question 10. The prescribing and dispensing of human medications
has long been separated. With eyeglasses and contact lenses, where
prescribers also sell the products they prescribe, Federal law grants
consumers the right to their prescriptions. Why should it be any
different for pet owners with regards to medications for their pets?
Answer. Keeping markets open and competitive can benefit consumers,
and their pets. As a nominee, I have not familiarized myself with the
pet medication market sufficiently to give an adequate answer. If
confirmed, I would plan to do so, and to consult with my colleagues,
career staff and you and other interested members of Congress on an
appropriate path forward.
Question 11. Manufacturers of pet medications can, and do offer
inducements to veterinary clinics to prescribe and sell their
medications. Do you think the public, and pet owners who spend billions
of dollars annually on prescription pet medications have a right to
know whether their vet clinic is receiving payments from the
manufacturers of drugs that clinic prescribes?
Answer. There are times when mandated disclosures can add important
information that make markets more transparent and competitive. As a
nominee, I have not familiarized myself with the specific issue you
raise. If confirmed, I would plan to learn more about it and to consult
with my colleagues and career staff.
Question 12. In 2003, Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act (``FCLCA'') to grant the 40 million Americans who wear
contact lens wearers the right to copies of their prescriptions. The
law also established a process for consumers to have their
prescriptions verified when they purchase their lenses from a retailer
other than the prescriber.
On September 3, 2015, the FTC launched its ten-year review of the
Contact Lens Rule. The comment period closed on October 26, 2015, after
the Commission received over 660 comments from a wide variety of
stakeholders including optometrists, ophthalmologists, consumers,
contact lens manufacturers and third-party contact lens sellers such as
big box stores and online retailers.
On December 7, 2016, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (``NPRM'') concluding that ``compliance with the automatic
prescription release provision could be substantially improved.'' This
is consistent with the comments of 20 State Attorneys General who
reported to the Commission that: ``[t]he States are aware, from their
enforcement efforts and collective experience, that not all patients
receive their prescription in writing as a matter of course.'' The NPRM
also proposed the common sense solutions of having consumers sign an
acknowledgement that they have received their prescriptions and
clarifying the right of consumers and their chosen retailers to receive
additional copies of those prescriptions.
If confirmed, will you prioritize finalizing this proposed rule, to
help ensure all consumers will receive copies of their prescriptions,
as Congress intended? Considering FTC's limited resources, and the
significant resources that would be required to take action against
individual prescribers who are not in compliance with this requirement
under the current rule, do you agree that the FTC's proposed rule is an
efficient means of promoting compliance?
Answer. Next month, the FTC will conduct a workshop to evaluate the
proposed changes to the Contact Lens Rule. If confirmed, I look forward
to working with my colleagues and career staff to evaluate the
knowledge gleaned both from the comments received on the Contact Lens
Rule over the past few years and additional information that may come
from the workshop, including with respect to the efficiency of the
proposed rule.
Question 13. The FTC has not pursued any enforcement activity under
the Military Lending Act, despite having the authority to enforce this
important protection. If confirmed, would you support vigorous
enforcement of the MLA?
Answer. Yes.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to
Noah Joshua Phillips
Question 1. The February 2013, the Federal Trade Commission
published a report that found that five percent of consumers had errors
on their credit reports that could result in less favorable terms for
loans.
Based on that study, do you think the consumer reporting agencies
(CRAs) comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)'s requirement
to ``follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy''
of credit reports? (15 USC 1681e(b))
Do you think the FTC should conduct a follow up study to see if
error rates have improved?
If error rates continue to impact millions of Americans, what
actions should the FTC take to enforce compliance with the FCRA?
Do you think the policies and practices of CRAs to handle consumer
disputes are in compliance with the FCRA?
In 2015, the New York Attorney General reached a groundbreaking
settlement with the three national consumer reporting agencies--
Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. The terms of the settlement require
the CRAs to do more to ensure maximum possible accuracy of credit
reports and to improve the dispute resolution process for consumers.
Do you think the terms of the settlement regarding dispute
resolution represent best practices for CRAs' compliance with the
FCRA's requirement that CRAs conduct a ``reasonable reinvestigation''
if the consumer disputes the accuracy of the information in his or her
credit report? (15 USC 1681i)
Can the FTC use its current authorities to hold CRAs to higher
standards when it comes to handling consumer disputes?
What are your views on the adequacy of the Fair Credit Reporting
Act enforcement regime?
What are your views on the inclusion of medical debt in credit
reports?
Consumers have the right to inspect their credit reports every
year. Do you think they should also have the right to inspect their
credit score?
Do you think the credit reporting market is functioning well? In
your view, what areas could be improved?
Do you think it is sound public policy for consumers to have to pay
to freeze their credit report?
Do you think it is confusing for consumers to understand the
difference between freezes, which are defined by and regulated under
state law, and the CRAs' various ``lock'' products, which fall outside
of the protection of state law?
Answer. As you and I have discussed, I am aware of the important
role that credit reporting agencies play in the economy and the lives
of individual American consumers, including in particular the negative
role that CRAs' mistakes can have upon those consumers. As a nominee, I
have not been briefed by agency staff on these issues, or studied this
market, including its evolution, common practices and governing state
and Federal laws, in sufficient depth to give adequate answers to
questions 1-8. Without doubt, these questions address important issues.
If confirmed, I look forward to being briefed on them, and consulting
with my colleagues, staff and, where appropriate, your office on these
questions.
Question 2. Should the FTC have the authority to ensure compliance
with the Safeguards Rule?
Answer. Pursuant to the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the FTC promulgated
the Safeguards Rule, which requires financial institutions under FTC
jurisdiction to have measures in place to keep customer information
secure. My understanding is that the FTC has brought several
enforcement actions. If confirmed, I will consult with staff and my
colleagues about the status of the Rule, including any proposed
revisions to the scope of authority.
Question 3. Do you think the FTC has the right expertise and
capacity to investigate and evaluate algorithms for unfair, deceptive,
fraudulent consumer practices in the marketplace?
Answer. As we discussed, the proliferating use of algorithms raise
novel consumer protection questions, as well potentially as antirust
ones. This is the kind of changing market practice I had in mind when I
testified that the agency needs to keep abreast of trends in the
market. If confirmed, I commit to looking into whether the FTC has the
right expertise and capacity.
Question 4. Will you prioritize bringing in additional technical
talent to strengthen FTC's mission in the digital domain?
Answer. Yes.
Question 5. What are your views of the FTC's ability to ensure
adequate oversight of online privacy? Please include your perspective
on the FTC's expertise and the adequacy of the regulatory tools
available to it. What specific actions would you propose the FTC
undertake to improve online privacy?
Answer. The FTC is the Federal agency with the most experience and
best ability to police issues related to online privacy. The Commission
hones its expertise by interfacing with scholars and stakeholders on
privacy questions, most notably at its ``PrivacyCon'' conferences.
Acting Chairman Ohlhausen has stressed the importance of additional
research to understand the economics of privacy and consumer harm, and
I believe continuing those efforts is essential. Of course, the FTC
also must enforce the law, including the FTC Act. To the extent
inadequate privacy practices constitute unfair or deceptive ones under
Section 5, the Commission should also consider bringing enforcement
actions.
Question 6. The FCC's Net Neutrality order is premised upon ISPs
disclosing voluntary policies and the FTC enforcing compliance with
those polices.
Do you agree that the FTC's authority only extends to enforcing a
company's compliance with whatever policy the company issues? If not,
please explain.
Answer. No. To the extent practices related to net neutrality
constitute antitrust violations or unfair practices under Section 5 of
the FTC Act, the Commission would be able to bring enforcement actions
under those laws.
Question 7. If the Ninth Circuit's decision in FTC v. AT&T Mobility
is allowed to stand, what authority, if any, will the FTC retain to
enforce these company policies?
Answer. The impact of the pending proceedings in the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remains to be seen, and will depend upon
what that court decides. The courts and Congress together will define
the FTC's enforcement authority.
Question 8. What is your view of the propriety of the FTC imposing
conditions on proposed mergers as compared with suing to block a deal?
How would you evaluate when to use one or the other?
Answer. My general view is that remedies are best calibrated
depending on the facts and law that apply to a particular merger. The
FTC will sometimes demand divestitures (``structural remedies'') and
sometimes changes to conduct (``behavioral remedies'') in order to
approve a merger. Sometimes, the parties cannot agree on those remedies
and litigation may be appropriate and advisable. If confirmed, in every
case that comes before the Commission, I would consider the
recommendations of staff and work with my fellow commissioners to
determine the best approach to protect competition and consumers.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tom Udall to
Noah Joshua Phillips
Question 1. What are your ideas how to promote consumer protection
in an increasingly online--and connected--world?
Answer. The increasing and constantly-changing role of online
commerce makes consumer protection an ever more difficult task. As I
indicated in my questionnaire to the Committee and hearing testimony, I
believe that one of the FTC's top priorities must be keeping abreast of
trends in technology and business practices. It must understand the
technology and study the economics of how it is used and impacts
consumers, listening at all times to input from other law enforcement
agencies, consumers and other important stakeholders. Where
appropriate, the FTC should leverage its research, consumer and
business education and enforcement resources to protect consumers
online.
Question 2. Do you believe that the current FTC enforcement
principles are sufficient to protect consumers? And do you believe the
FTC has the resources necessary to protect consumers given the
significant amount of work on the docket for the agency?
Answer. Congress has given the FTC significant authority to protect
consumers, notably including the FTC Act's proscription of unfair or
deceptive acts or practices, and unfair methods of competition. With
respect to that authority and resources, if confirmed, I will work with
my fellow Commissioners and staff to evaluate the sufficiency of each
and, if necessary, with Congress to remedy any deficiencies.
Question 3. In December, I wrote to the FTC, along with Senators
Schumer and Blumenthal, asking for a workshop to discuss the increased
use of ``bots'' to purchase large quantities of in-demand toys and
items, particularly at Christmas. The FTC has confirmed that it will
engage with key stakeholders to determine if a workshop is necessary.
Will you commit to reviewing the record on this issue and to working
with my office to determine next steps, including the possibility of
legislation?
Answer. Yes.
Question 4. Last week, an article in TechCrunch showed how Facebook
uses data from Onavo Protect, a subsidiary app, to gather data on its
competitors; how Google uses its search rankings to demote alternate
competitive sites; and Amazon's aggressive low pricing undercuts book
publishers. Under your respective leadership, how will the FTC enforce
the principles of unfair methods of competition against tech giants
like Facebook, Google and Amazon to promote consumer welfare?
Answer. I believe the FTC should apply the law fairly and
carefully, no matter who is violating it. No one, from boiler room scam
artists to the largest companies in the United States, is above the
law. In dynamic markets like technology in particular, the FTC must
also keep abreast of changing trends; watching how they develop and
seeing how our laws, including consumer protection and antitrust,
apply. If confirmed, I will work with my fellow Commissioners to see
that the agency keeps track of these trends and, where violations of
the law occur, enforces it.
Question 5. Following the FTC's approval of the Google/DoubleClick
acquisition in 2007, then Commissioner Pamela Jones Harbor released a
dissent detailing the need for the commission to ``evaluate the
implication of this kind of data merger from a competition as well as a
consumer protection perspective.'' As commissioner, how would you use
this framing of data mergers in evaluating mergers and acquisitions in
the technology industry?
Answer. That no one--and no corporation, no matter how large--is
above the law is a bedrock principle of American justice. I believe the
FTC should apply the law fairly and carefully, no matter who may be
violating it. In dynamic markets like technology in particular, it must
also keep abreast of changing trends. The increasingly important role
of data is one such trend, and the FTC has already begun important work
in studying it. The law governing mergers and the FTC standards for
evaluating them are well-established, and should be applied rigorously
in evaluating mergers and acquisitions in the technology industry.
Where a merger violates Section 7 of the Clayton Act--that is, where a
merger's effects may be substantially to lessen competition, or to tend
to create a monopoly, it should be subject to enforcement.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to
Noah Joshua Phillips
Question 1. When Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act in 2004 it helped reduce barriers to retail competition
in the contact lens market and led to lower prices for consumers.
However, contact retailers sometimes sell patients contact lenses after
the prescription has expired or fail to adequately verify the
prescription in accordance to FCLCA. In some cases, this has led to
dangerous eye and health conditions for the patient. How can the FTC
work in coordination with the FDA, CDC and other Federal agencies to
make sure contact lens patients are receiving high quality care and
safe contact lenses?
Answer. The FTC has a long tradition of working cooperatively with
other agencies in the Federal Government that may have expertise that
can be brought to bear on issues it confronts. If confirmed, I will
work to determine whether and to what extent the FTC is working with
the FDA, CDC and other agencies with applicable expertise in the
context of the re-consideration of the Contact Lens Rule.
Question 2. In December 2016, the FTC issued a proposed change to
the current Contact Lens Rule that mandated that all eye doctors obtain
a signed acknowledgement form from each of their contact lens patients
when they receive a copy of their prescription. Do you know of any
other ways for patients to understand their right to their contact lens
prescription that would be just as, if not, more effective than a
written acknowledgement?
Answer. As a nominee, I have not studied the relative efficacy of
available methods of helping patients understand their rights under the
Contact Lens Rule. I do understand that the agency has received
substantial input from a wide variety of stakeholders over several
years, and is convening a workshop next month on this issue. If
confirmed, I look forward to reviewing the results of that work to
determine the best course forward as the FTC reviews the Contact Lens
Rule.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
to Noah Joshua Phillips
Question 1. Restoring Internet Freedom FCC-FTC MOU
Within the net neutrality MOU, signed between the FCC and FTC,
regarding the FTC's authority it states: ``Congress has directed the
FTC to, among other things, prevent unfair methods of competition and
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.''
Therefore, can you say without reservation that you'll have what
you will need, upon being confirmed at the FTC, to actually catch
improper actions taken by Internet service providers toward consumers?
Answer. Through the FTC Act, Congress has given the FTC significant
authority to protect consumers. According to the FTC staff, prior to
the FCC's 2015 reclassification of Internet service providers as
``common carriers'' under Title II of the Telecommunications Act, the
FTC used its consumer protection and antitrust authorities to protect
broadband consumers and the competitive process in Internet-related
markets.
Through the appropriations process, Congress has provided the FTC
with funds to operate. With respect to the adequacy of its legal
authority and financial resources, if confirmed, I will work with my
fellow Commissioners and staff to evaluate these and, if necessary,
discuss with Congress potential remedies to any deficiencies.
Question 2. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
Unfortunately we still don't know the full FTC authority over
common carriers, like in the case pending on AT&T, so I would like to
hear what you anticipate will be FTC's authority going forward.
Answer. The en banc panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit has not issued a ruling in the pending litigation
involving AT&T Mobility. Currently, the FTC has authority over the
activities of common carriers. But the courts, and Congress, will
determine whether and to what extent that authority continues. In the
event the FTC does not prevail in the litigation, I would support
seeking a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court. If confirmed, and
if warranted, I will work with my fellow Commissioners and staff to
determine whether additional authority is necessary. If so, I would
support engagement with Congress on that.
Question 3. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
How you can ensure the FTC will even have the authority to enforce
the limited principles covered in Chairman Pai's weak form of net
neutrality?
Answer. The FTC has important authority to protect consumers under
the FTC Act. The FCC, Congress and, as applicable, the courts will
collectively determine whether the FTC has authority to enforce the net
neutrality principles covered in the FCC's order. If confirmed, I would
support a discussion with Congress on what the proper scope of that
authority should be, if such discussion proves necessary.
Question 4. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
And I would ask if you can provide me a true commitment to act on
behalf of consumers who are impacted by less than fair practices by
some in the telecommunications industry.
Answer. Yes, if confirmed, I will commit to enforce the laws passed
by Congress to protect consumers, including from unfair or deceptive
acts or practices subject to the FTC's jurisdiction.
Question 5. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
Can you please define for me what the lead telecommunications
policy expert Federal agency is, in your opinion?
Answer. The FCC is the principal Federal telecommunications
regulatory agency. The FTC has long enforced its antitrust and consumer
protection authorities, including against telecommunications companies.
Each agency has expertise about the matters within its jurisdiction. If
confirmed, I would support the Commission continuing to enforce its
authority, as permitted by law.
Question 6. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
Have you specifically recently read the MOU on net neutrality
between the FCC and FTC, and do you support it in its entirety?
Answer. Yes. My view is that, until withdrawn or modified, a
memorandum of understanding validly entered into by the FTC should
continue to bind the Commission.
Question 7. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
What is your understanding of the capacity of the staff currently
at the FTC, and do you think you can effectively execute this agreement
enough to garner true public trust in ensuring a truly free and open
internet?
Answer. The FTC boasts over a thousand professionals, including
lawyers, technologists, economists and support staff. I have great
faith in their collective capacity, which is based upon my
understanding of their demonstrated ability to enforce the FTC Act and
other laws in complex industries, including those with technology that
is difficult to master. In its submission to the FCC last year, the FTC
staff detailed the Commission's experience with Internet service
providers, telecommunications companies and internet-related issues. If
confirmed, I would consult with my colleagues and FTC staff to
determine whether additional resources are necessary for the Commission
effectively to execute its commitments.
Question 8. Supposed Transparency and ISP's Public Policies
The net neutrality MOU between the FCC-FTC states: Consistent with
its jurisdiction, the FTC will investigate and take enforcement action
as appropriate against Internet service providers for unfair,
deceptive, or otherwise unlawful acts or practices, including but not
limited to, actions pertaining to the accuracy of the disclosures such
providers make pursuant to the Internet Freedom Order's requirements,
as well as their marketing, advertising, and promotional activities.
Do you have a sense that you can ask ISPs to amend their supposed
transparent blocking and throttling language or commitments?
In other words, is it your opinion that your authority at the FTC
includes determining whether the ISPs are being transparent or in other
cases, just presenting a very broad policy that leaves gaps in a
consumer's understanding of their providers protections or limitations
to control the flow of information to them?
Answer. My understanding is that the transparency measures in the
FCC's order are intended to give the FTC additional tools to police net
neutrality-related conduct by Internet service providers that may
violate the FTC Act. Under the MOU, the FTC indicates that it will
investigate and take enforcement action as appropriate against ISPs
concerning the accuracy of those disclosures, as well as other
deceptive or unfair acts or practices involving their broadband
services.
Question 9. Broadband Internet Speed Honesty
I am aware that various state Attorneys General are concerned that
a telecomm industry petition to the FCC on cost transparency, related
to the advertisement of Internet speeds, quote ``represents nothing
more than the industry's effort to shield itself from state law
enforcement.''
Given the FTC's mission regarding deceptive practices, can you
speak to your perspective on whether this is fair consumer protection
issue to be concerned about at FTC, given the prices and promises ISPs
make to generate more business?
Answer. I am not familiar with the specific petition to the FCC in
question. That said, the FTC can and should concern itself with any
activities within its jurisdiction that may constitute violations of
either the antitrust or consumer protection provisions of the FTC Act.
Question 10. FTC Investigation on GPS tracking of Vehicles
Last year it was revealed that the Federal Trade Commission is
investigating GPS tracking technologies used in the subprime auto loan
industry, but my understanding is that no findings or rulings have been
released. Going back as far 2014, the New York Times had highlighted
this as a concern. In their piece, they highlighted a troubling story
of a mother in Las Vegas, Mary Bolender, who needed to get her child
with a 103.5-degree fever to the ER, but her 2005 Chrysler van wouldn't
start. As the piece says--``The cause was not a mechanical problem--it
was her lender.''
Now I have a number of concerns with their as a business practice,
but can I get a commitment from you to continue to look into this issue
and publically provide information on your findings and enforcement
determinations in a timely manner?
Answer. I understand the FTC has done some work on this issue. If
confirmed, I commit that I will consult with my colleagues and FTC
staff to determine the amount of information regarding findings and
determinations that appropriately can be disclosed.
Question 11. Franchise Business Oversight
The FTC has jurisdiction over franchise businesses. In my state, I
have heard complaints from Subway franchisees that the Franchise
Disclosure Document is written in favor of the franchisor in a way that
can undermine their ability to succeed. Nevada's neighboring state of
California has passed a bill protecting franchisees.
How can the FTC expand protections for franchisees so they can
financially succeed?
Answer. To the extent conduct by franchisors violates the
requirements of the FTC's Franchise Rule, or the FTC Act, that conduct
deserves scrutiny by the agency.
Question 12. Mortgage Closing Fraud
Thieves have been targeting mortgage closings, where they break
into a realtor or title company's e-mail accounts. Then, they tell the
homebuyer to wire money they have saved and borrowed to a bank account
owned by the thieves.
How do you think the FTC can work with the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau to prevent these types of scams?
Answer. For the better part of a century, the FTC has worked to
protect consumers against scams such as these using its authority to
police unfair or deceptive acts or practices. If confirmed, I will work
with my fellow commissioners to ensure that it continues to do so. The
FTC shares with the CFPB certain legal authorities related to consumer
finance, and their relationship is governed by a memorandum of
understanding (MOU). The agencies should work in accordance with that
MOU, collaboratively and in a way that leverages each of their
expertise and capabilities. The FTC should evaluate whether the MOU
facilitates the optimal coordination between the agencies, and, if
confirmed, I commit to working with my fellow commissioners to do so.
The FTC also has specific experience with consumer education, which can
also be used to help consumers avoid scams such as these.
Question 13. Reverse Mortgages
Reverse mortgages are products sold to seniors to help them ``age-
in-place'' and use their home equity as a means by which to responsibly
pay their bills. Reverse mortgages can be sensible products, but
sometimes have been falsely advertised to seniors. The FTC and the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau conducted a ``sweep'' of reverse
mortgage advertisements, and a review of consumer complaints, and found
that three reverse mortgage companies engaged in deceptive advertising
which misled consumers.
Given the overlapping jurisdictions between the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau and the FTC, can you discuss how you envision the two
entities work together to combat financial fraud, specifically scams
impacting seniors?
Answer. My understanding is that seniors are sometimes especially
susceptible to financial fraud, and are often targeted by bad actors.
The FTC has a long and proud tradition of policing fraud, and in
particular of protecting seniors, service members and other vulnerable
and targeted groups. The legal actions taken just days ago, in
conjunction with the Department of Justice and the Attorney General of
the State of Missouri, are good examples of that tradition, which, if
confirmed, I look forward to working with my fellow commissioners to
continue.
As I noted above, the FTC shares with the CFPB certain legal
authorities related to consumer finance, and their relationship is
governed by an MOU. The agencies should work in accordance with it,
collaboratively and in a way that leverages each of their expertise and
capabilities. The recent sweep is an example of that. The FTC should
evaluate whether the MOU facilitates the optimal coordination between
the agencies, and, if confirmed, I commit to working with my fellow
commissioners to do so. The FTC also has specific experience with
consumer education, which can be used to help consumers avoid scams
such as these.
Question 14. Debt Collection
Debt collectors generate more complaints to the FTC than any other
industry. And in recent years, the CFPB has noted that debt collection
remains the top complaint received by the Bureau from older Americans.
Specifically, the Consumer Bureau identified several issues related to
debt collection and seniors, including hounding calls, harassment and
threats of impermissible Social Security garnishment.
How do you think the FTC could work with the CFPB to bring more
rules-of-the road to this part of the financial services marketplace to
protect consumers--particularly seniors--from fraudulent practices?
Answer. The FTC enforces a number of Federal laws, notably the Fair
Debt Collection Practices Act, in conjunction with the CFPB. Seniors
are sometimes susceptible to illegal debt collection conduct, and are
often targeted with it. The CFPB reports annually on its enforcement
progress to Congress. If confirmed, I would support Commission efforts
to evaluate what is working and what is not with respect to protecting
seniors from illegal practices. The FTC should evaluate whether the MOU
with the CFPB facilitates the optimal coordination between the
agencies; and, if confirmed, I commit to working with my fellow
commissioners to do so.
Question 15. Merger Review Commitment
With increased multi-industry players growing in prominence by
acquiring more businesses outside their core business model, can you
commit to reviewing the horizontal merger guidelines, which have not
directly addressed vertical mergers since 1984?
Answer. The Horizontal Merger Guidelines have provided market
participants with important guidance about how both the Department of
Justice Antitrust Division and the FTC consider horizontal mergers.
They are designed primarily to articulate the analytical framework the
Agencies apply in determining whether a merger's effects may be
substantially to lessen competition, and are updated periodically to
reflect changes in that approach, prompted by changes in the caselaw or
otherwise. As you state, the ``guidelines'' framework for evaluating
vertical mergers has not been updated since 1984, although both
agencies have provided additional guidance on the analytical framework
for evaluating such conduct. If confirmed, I commit to working with my
colleagues, career staff and the DOJ Antitrust Division to review
merger guidelines as necessary.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. John Thune to
Rohit Chopra
Question 1. The FTC is responsible for enforcing the Nation's
antitrust laws. While I appreciate that you are not an antitrust
attorney, do you nevertheless have any experience in this area? For
example, have you worked on any antitrust or competition policy issues
during your professional career? If not, what aspects of your
professional experience do you believe make you qualified to consider
and render decisions in antitrust matters, should you be confirmed?
Answer. Yes, I have been involved in competition issues in my
professional career.
For example, I helped to develop the Consumer Financial Protection
Bureau's market monitoring function that included monitoring of
competitive intensity. This function aggregated publicly-available data
to provide a range of evidence-based insights, including where consumer
welfare might be enhanced through more competition.
Specifically, the analysis identified that net interest margins for
private student loan products were not narrowing, unlike margins for
other products. I led an effort to engage capital markets participants
and industry innovators to remove perceived regulatory barriers to
private student loan refinancing. Market participants have noted that
this work helped to provide greater certainty and incubate more
competition and shopping by borrowers, helping them to achieve better
products at lower prices.
I was also involved in law enforcement efforts that asserted claims
of alleged violations of ``unfair or deceptive acts and practices,''
pursuant to the Consumer Financial Protection Act (CFPA). The CFPA is
modeled after Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. As a
policy leader for the student loan market vertical, I was closely
involved in analysis to determine whether any alleged practices could
be justified by countervailing benefits to competition.
In another example of competition advocacy, I was closely involved
in the development of the Financial Aid Shopping Sheet, an effort to
help make costs and risks of borrowing for college more transparent,
while also facilitating more competition between institutions of higher
education in the financial aid process. I drafted the original
prototype made available for public comment. The CFPB and the
Department of Education released a final version of the Shopping Sheet,
which was voluntarily adopted by thousands of institutions of higher
education.
While serving at Special Adviser to the Secretary of Education, I
served as an agency representative to the interagency process seeking
to implement Executive Order 13725, signed in 2016 by President Obama
to promote competition across sectors of the economy. While at the
Education Department, I was also involved in policy development on how
the agency should consider changes in control and changes in ownership
(mergers and acquisitions), which required the Secretary's approval
with respect to institutions of higher education.
In my private sector career, I advised both large companies and
small investment firms on strategic acquisitions. Analyzing these
potential acquisitions included extensive empirical work on how new
technologies and software could be integrated into existing product
lines. This analysis also considered the complexity of cross-border
competition issues. This experience, in particular, gave me a deep
appreciation for the importance of providing market participants with
rapid determinations about whether an acquisition might be challenged,
since long, drawn-out deliberations can impose significant costs.
At the same time, while I have deep experience in consumer
protection enforcement, I have not been directly involved in antitrust
law enforcement. I will draw on the expertise of the Bureaus of
Competition and Economics, as well as these professional experiences,
including my formal training in finance, accounting, and applied
economics, to contribute to the agency's mission.
Question 2. According to media reports, a former employee at the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has alleged that the agency
systematically identified and rejected Republican job applicants. Did
you participate in any effort at CFPB to reject Republican or
conservative-leaning job applicants? If so, please describe these
efforts in detail.
Answer. Without qualification, I did not participate in or observe
any efforts to reject applicants based on political beliefs.
Question 3. According to media reports, a former CFPB employee
revealed that there were weekly hiring meetings at CFPB in which
interviewers summarized the qualifications and attributes of
applicants, and any attendee could voice an opinion before each
candidate's verdict was rendered. Note-taking was strictly forbidden,
and interviewers reportedly destroyed their records after the meetings.
Did you attend these weekly hiring meetings at CFPB? If so, did you
ever summarize the backgrounds of any applicants for jobs at CFPB?
Provide a list of applicants whose backgrounds you summarized for jobs
at CFPB.
Did you ever voice an opinion about job applicants at CFPB? If so,
provide a list of each applicant on which you opined.
Did you engage in destruction of records regarding applicants for
jobs at CFPB during your tenure there? If so, please explain why you
destroyed these records.
Answer. No, I did not attend these Office of Enforcement weekly
hiring meetings, provide applicant summaries, voice opinions about job
applicants directly or indirectly for these meetings, nor engage in any
destruction of records.
I did serve as hiring manager over certain positions at the CFPB.
Notably, none of these positions were filled using a non-competitive
hiring authority. I chose to publicly post all vacancies for positions
under my supervision and subject applications to third-party review to
determine whether an applicant met the technical qualifications in
order to be advanced for further consideration.
I was proud to hire and supervise veterans eligible for hiring
preference, including those with a service-connected disability. Other
than veterans' preference, which is explicitly authorized under Federal
law, all candidates were evaluated on a competitive basis in accordance
with OPM and agency policy, which forbids consideration of political
affiliation in competitive hiring.
Question 4. A Freedom of Information Act investigation last year
revealed that you coordinated a meeting between CFPB Director Richard
Cordray and Eileen Mancera, a longtime Democratic fundraiser and
lobbyist. Please explain the circumstances regarding your coordination
of this meeting. Why were you engaging in apparent political activity
in your capacity as a Federal employee?
Answer. I did not arrange a meeting between CFPB Director Richard
Cordray and Eileen Mancera.
The senior leadership team at the CFPB regularly referred incoming
inquiries from current and prospective market participants in the
student loan industry to me.
While I engaged in hundreds of calls and meetings with prospective
market participants in an effort to be responsive to the marketplace, I
do recall that Director Cordray suggested I reach out to Ms. Mancera,
who worked for an investment firm.
I further recall that she and I had a brief conversation about the
private student loan market, an area where her firm was exploring
activity. We had no further communication after this brief
conversation.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Roger F. Wicker to
Rohit Chopra
Question 1. Many online companies are engaging in targeted
advertising. Using consumer data, companies can target what they deem
to be the most relevant ads to consumers. Should there be more
transparency into how the algorithms behind targeted advertising work
so that consumers can see how they are being targeted for certain
messages?
Answer. Many consumers may be unaware that a wide variety of data
is collected on them and combined for the purposes of marketing and
advertising. I read with interest the Federal Trade Commission's 2016
report entitled ``Big Data: A Tool for Inclusion or Exclusion?'' The
report outlines some of the public policy implications with respect to
the use of algorithms.
As a general matter, transparency contributes to a properly-
functioning marketplace. I look forward to consulting closely with the
FTC's staff on this issue, which requires careful attention, given its
impact on consumer protection, privacy, and competition.
Question 2. Would third party audits of algorithms be a reasonable
way to ensure the algorithms are doing what companies claim and not
harming competition or consumer choice? Is this something the FTC might
consider looking into?
Answer. Some companies that rely on algorithms and machine-learning
do engage in third-party audits to determine whether they are in
compliance with law and regulation. This is particularly true for
companies that offer services related to the offering of credit,
housing, and employment, given existing statutory protections against
non-discrimination. However, this is certainly not the norm.
I look forward to engaging with policy experts at the FTC, industry
stakeholders, and consumer and privacy advocates to better understand
these issues and determine how the FTC might best add value to advance
its consumer protection and competition mission.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Dan Sullivan to
Rohit Chopra
Question 1. As a former Attorney General of Alaska, I always
appreciated coordination with Federal agencies where appropriate, and
the opportunity to communicate solutions that made the most sense for
Alaskans. Given the importance of state attorneys general to the FTC's
antitrust enforcement, please describe your views on the working
relationship between the FTC and state attorneys general.
Answer. I am fortunate to have developed working relationships with
a bipartisan group of state Attorneys General and their staffs. As I
noted in the hearing, state Attorneys General are key partners to
Federal law enforcement. I have direct experience in partnering with
state Attorneys General on investigations and consumer education.
I have regularly addressed participants at conferences and meetings
hosted by the National Association of Attorneys General. In 2016, I
served as the keynote speaker for a conference hosted by the Conference
of Western Attorneys General (CWAG), which includes among its members
the Attorney General of Alaska.
State Attorneys General and other state officials are invaluable
partners, and I hope to build on my existing relationships and work
with these offices for the benefit of Alaskans and all Americans.
Question 2. As you know, the state I represent is unique which
means its problems are unique and require unconventional solutions. In
a highly rural state like Alaska, many communities are not connected by
roads, challenging weather conditions prohibit timely delivery of mail
and other essential services, and quality connectivity is considered a
luxury. One of your objectives at the Commission is consumer protection
and education. How will you ensure that rural constituents like mine
have the tools they need to make informed decisions and in cases of
abuse that require follow up, for example data breaches or identity
theft, the information necessary to mitigate risks and resolve the
issue?
Answer. In my previous service as a government official, I noted
that traditional methods employed by Federal agencies to engage and
educate consumers were often ineffective, particularly when quality
connectivity was a barrier. I learned a great deal from visiting rural
areas to understand how to best partner with state and local government
to reach consumers in an efficient and effective manner. I am committed
to soliciting feedback from elected officials, including Members of
Congress, to gain insight on how to ensure that the FTC is reaching
Americans in rural areas.
Question 3. In your prepared statement, you discuss anticompetitive
consolidation, which immediately called to mind the enormous market
capitalization of tech companies. Recent calculations value the four
largest tech companies' capitalization at $2.8 trillion, which is a
staggering 24 percent of the S&P 500 Top 50, close to the value of
every stock traded on the Nasdaq in 2001, and to give a different
perspective, approximately the same amount as France's current GDP.
Press reports have also noted allegations of increased anti-competitive
behavior by some of these companies. Is there a point at which these
companies are simply too big from an antitrust standpoint?
Answer. While I appreciate this concern, existing law and
regulation generally does not establish specific caps or size triggers
with respect to market capitalization, assets, revenue, or profits.
However, as I noted in my responses to questions in the hearing,
the technology sector competes with firms in a broad range of sectors,
not just firms that are seen as technology firms. In addition, the
technology sector has contributed an increasing share of economic
activity and growth in the U.S. economy. Therefore, it will be critical
for the FTC to carefully analyze market dynamics in the technology
sector to ensure that the law is being followed and that competition is
robust.

Question. When Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act in 2003, it was a pro-consumer measure that ensured
consumers automatically receive a copy of his or her prescription after
an eye exam--without having to ask for it, pay an additional fee, or
sign a waiver. Do you agree that consumers should receive copies of
their prescriptions as Congress intended so that they can use the
prescription to purchase their contact lenses from a source of their
choosing?
Answer. The Fairness to Contact Lens Consumers Act explicitly
provides for patients to obtain a copy of a prescription from a
prescriber whether or not the patient requests one. I agree that there
are benefits to competition of the Act, and the FTC should carefully
consider all points of view to ensure that the implementation of this
law creates the benefits to the marketplace as Congress intended.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Bill Nelson to
Rohit Chopra
Question 1. The FTC is a relatively small agency that has to
effectively use its resources to cover a very broad jurisdiction. In
this regard, as a matter of discretion, it may be wise for the FTC to
pursue enforcement cases involving practices that result in substantial
harm. However, substantial harm is not a legal requirement under
section five of the FTC Act--cases involving deception do not require
harm at all, and cases involving unfairness can involve harm that is
prospective and/or non-financial. Consequently, it is very important
that commissioners do not stringently require types of harm as a legal
test for agency enforcement actions. This principle is particularly
important because Lab MD is challenging the FTC's legal authority to
bring enforcement actions for data breaches based on the lack of
requisite harm. As a commissioner, will you pledge to not require
substantial harm or financial harm as legal tests for FTC enforcement
actions?
Answer. Yes. The FTC should not create additional legal
requirements unless based in statute, regulation, or legal precedent.
Question 2. The FTC's Bureau of Economics provides valuable insight
and analysis that supplements the FTC's work. However, the FTC is,
first and foremost, a law enforcement agency, not a regulatory agency.
As such, economic analysis should play a complementary role, not a
dispositive one. The FTC should enforce the FTC Act and the other laws
under its jurisdiction according to legal doctrine, not economic
analyses. As a commissioner, will you pledge to continue to further the
FTC as a law enforcement agency in which the Bureau of Economics and
economic analyses play a complimentary role, not a dispositive role?
Will you pledge to enforce the law according to legal precedent?
Answer. Yes. As a practical matter, data and analysis, such as
consumer complaint trends, help to inform agency enforcement
priorities. However, the FTC not should create legal prerequisites to
bringing an enforcement action unless based in statute, regulation, or
legal precedent.
Question 3. Piracy continues to be a problem that plagues content
providers. The Internet is filled with websites that provide pirated
content and entertainment at the expense of the companies that produce
the content. Moreover, many of these websites can harm consumers with
unsafe or even fraudulent data and commercial practices. What can the
FTC do to crack down on the illegal piracy of American entertainment
and content?
Answer. While the FTC is generally not responsible for enforcing
intellectual property law, I agree that websites offering pirated
content might also deceive consumers into downloading malware. If
confirmed, I look forward to reviewing the agency's work-to-date on
this issue to determine the best course of action.
Question 4. Fraudulent websites can deceive consumers by
masquerading as legitimate hotel websites. Consumers who are fooled by
these sites reserve rooms that do not exist or turn out to be different
from what they reserved online. According to industry statistics, this
particular fraud affects millions of consumers a year and costs the
hotel industry hundreds of millions of dollars. I wrote former FTC
Chairwoman Edith Ramirez about this issue in June 2015. Will you pledge
to ensure that the FTC will work with other law enforcement entities
(such as state attorneys general) to bring enforcement actions against
fraudulent hotel websites?
Answer. Yes. Many Americans have limited time and resources to take
their family on a vacation. For families who have saved for this
experience over a long period of time, fraud can be particularly
harmful. If confirmed, I look forward to working with other law
enforcement agencies, including state attorneys general, to address
this misconduct.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Richard Blumenthal to
Rohit Chopra
Question 1. What experience do you have working with State
Attorneys General? What are your views regarding the Commission working
with state law enforcement?
Answer. I am fortunate to have developed working relationships with
a bipartisan group of state Attorneys General and their staffs. As I
noted in the hearing, state Attorneys General are key partners to
Federal law enforcement.
I have direct experience in partnering with state Attorneys General
on investigations and consumer education. For example, my colleagues
and I referred a matter regarding a deceptive website, GIBill.com,
which was targeting veterans for their Federal education benefit
dollars and masquerading as an official website of the Department of
Veterans Affairs. A bipartisan group of 20 state Attorneys General
reached an agreement with the operator of the website, fining the
company and ordering the website to be turned over to the Federal
Government.
I have also regularly addressed participants at conferences and
meetings hosted by the National Association of Attorneys General, the
Conference of Western Attorneys General, and the Center for State
Enforcement of Antitrust and Consumer Protection Laws.
State Attorneys General and other state officials are invaluable
partners, and I hope to build on my existing relationships and work
with these offices to advance the FTC's mission.
Question 2. In the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, Congress gave the FTC
extensive authority over the sale, servicing, and leasing of
automobiles--charging it to protect consumers from abusive auto lending
practices and granting it exclusive authority to draft rules governing
unfair or deceptive acts or practices by automobile dealers. Would you
support the FTC using its rulemaking authority to rein in unfair or
deceptive acts or practices by automobile dealers?
Answer. Section 1029 of the Dodd-Frank Act provided the FTC with
rulemaking authority using procedures under the Administrative
Procedure Act to address unfair or deceptive financing practices by
automobile dealers.
Importantly, the section of this law also requires that the FTC
coordinate with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors and the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau's Office of Service Member Affairs to
address complaints and concerns from military families with respect to
automobile dealers, with a particular focus on automobile dealers
operating in close proximity to military installations.
If confirmed, I plan to closely review complaints, assess
interagency coordination efforts, and engage stakeholders and work with
my fellow Commissioners to determine the best path forward.
Question 3. More than 17 million Americans are the victims of
identity theft every year. This problem seems to increase year over
year as identity theft scams seem to get more sophisticated.
Three years ago, the FTC established IdentityTheft.gov. This site
is supposed to be a one-stop shop for victims of identity theft where
they can easily freeze credit across the big three credit reporting
agencies, and recover their stolen identities.
This website's functionality is limited, however, because of what
appears to be a lack of engagement by the credit bureaus to make the
site what it should be.
How would you engage with credit bureaus to ensure
IdentityTheft.gov has a comprehensive suite of easy to use tools
allowing victims of identity theft to recover as quickly as possible,
with as little stress as possible? What are your expectations with
respect to the role the credit reporting agencies should play in making
IdentityTheft.gov an effective one-stop shop for identity theft
victims?
Answer. As data collection on consumers has grown to be more
extensive and with more frequent occurrences of data breaches, identity
theft can impose major costs and create frustration for consumers.
As a general matter, I believe the credit reporting industry needs
to be deeply engaged in efforts to help consumers recover from identity
theft as quickly as possible. If confirmed, I will seek to better
understand the industry's current level of engagement with respect to
making IdentityTheft.gov a successful resource for the public.
Question 4. Would you support FTC's jurisdiction be expanded to
include non-profits and charities so that it can act more swiftly to
prevent and stop illegal conduct in the nonprofit sector?
Answer. Over the years, there has been bipartisan support from
Federal Trade Commissioners to extend the FTC Act's jurisdiction to
include nonprofit organizations under certain circumstances. In
testimony prepared for Congress, the Commission has specifically noted
that nonprofit organizations are major participants in health care
markets, especially hospitals. While I have not closely studied this
issue, the agency's consumer protection and competition mission may be
furthered by ensuring a level playing field where all market
participants are subject to the same set of rules.
If confirmed, I will study this issue more closely and consult with
state Attorneys General (many of whom devote significant resources to
overseeing nonprofits and charities) to offer a more detailed
perspective to Congress on this issue, if requested.
Question 5. Other Federal agencies charged with consumer protection
make an array of data available on consumer complaints received. The
FTC releases relatively very little data on companies receiving
significant levels of complaints. Do you think the FTC should be more
transparent about the complaints it receives?
Answer. I am deeply committed to promoting transparency in
government. Not only does transparency make agencies more accountable
to Congress and the public, it reduces costs for prospective market
entrants seeking to understand their competitive landscape.
If confirmed, I look forward to identifying opportunities to
enhance transparency, including with respect to the FTC's Consumer
Sentinel database of complaints, while respecting consumer privacy and
other considerations.
Question 6. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was created in
response to the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession after it
became clear that our financial sector needed far more oversight to
prevent a disaster of that magnitude from happening ever again. The
current Administration seems intent on gutting this agency that serves
a critical role in protecting Americans from irresponsible financial
institutions. Of course, the CFPB and the FTC complement each other in
their protection of consumers. How do you envision the FTC's role in
holding financial institutions accountable?
Answer. Financial institutions play a fundamental role in the
economic security for American families. Given this outsized influence,
monitoring risks and potential harms to consumers is critical for the
FTC, the CFPB, and the prudential banking regulators, which each
enforce consumer protection laws in the financial services sector.
If confirmed, I believe that the FTC must execute its
responsibilities to enforce laws that Congress has delegated to the
agency, putting a priority on where risks to consumers is greatest. The
FTC must also prioritize enforcement where it has exclusive
jurisdiction and closely coordinate with the CFPB and the prudential
banking regulators where it shares jurisdiction.
Coordinating efforts across agencies is an iterative task. Whenever
possible, this process should be informed by consumer complaints and
other data, as well as resource allocation decisions by other agencies.
As a general matter, all of the agencies should deploy resources to
areas where there may be risk or harm in the market. After making this
assessment, an individual agency should assess whether it has unique
authorities or expertise that would make it best suited to addressing a
particular risk or harm in the market.
While the FTC, CFPB, and the prudential banking regulators all
share responsibility for enforcing certain consumer protection laws,
the FTC has exclusive jurisdiction and/or specialized expertise in
certain areas. For example, the FTC has exclusive jurisdiction for
enforce provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) related to the
security of customer information with respect to nonbank financial
institutions, such as credit reporting agencies.
Similarly, the FTC is unique among these agencies to have
jurisdiction to police nonbank small business lenders for unfair or
deceptive acts or practices. With this in mind, the FTC can and should
be held accountable by Congress and the public for ensuring adequate
oversight over these markets, given this exclusive jurisdiction.
Congress provided enforcement authority to the CFPB for certain
laws that had previously been exclusively enforced by the FTC at the
Federal level. Importantly, while Congress did transfer certain
enforcement authorities from other agencies to the CFPB, Congress did
not transfer enforcement authority from the FTC for many critical
consumer protection laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act and
the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. This choice by Congress
underscores the importance of continued FTC involvement and close
interagency coordination.
The FTC and CFPB coordinate their respective efforts under a
Memorandum of Understanding that has been revised over time. If
confirmed, I look forward to continuing these coordination efforts to
benefit consumers and the marketplace.
Question 7. Other consumer protection agencies appear to be
reducing the vigor of their enforcement work. In what way should this
impact the priorities of the FTC?
Answer. When allocating agency resources, I believe agency
leadership should deploy resources to areas where risk to consumers is
greatest, such as where there is a concentration of consumer
complaints. Risk to consumers might be higher or lower depending on the
priorities and resource allocation decisions of other Federal and state
agencies. Inasmuch as other agencies are reducing consumer protection
oversight, this can serve as one input for how the FTC develops its own
priorities and allocates its resources to protect consumers.
Question 8. In the past, the FTC has cracked down on for-profit
colleges and vocational programs with strong enforcement actions.
However, we're seeing these institutions continue to defraud Americans.
A study conducted by The Century Foundation found that 98 percent of
complaints asking for student loan forgiveness alleging fraud by
colleges were from students attending for-profit institutions. If
confirmed, how will you protect Americans from being scammed by such
institutions?
Answer. Students, their families, and honest colleges are all
harmed when some institutions use unfair or deceptive practices in the
higher education industry. Paying for college is one of the biggest
expenses a family makes. The FTC can and should make a concerted effort
to protect families from illegal practices in this sector.
Question 9. More than two of every three American households own a
pet. The FTC has estimated they will spend $10.2 billion on medications
this year, of which more than $5 billion require a prescription. It has
been estimated that pet owners who can get a copy of their pet's
prescription and shop around, could save 20 to 30 percent on branded
medications and 50 percent when they purchase generics. This suggests
that prescription portability can save pet owners billions of dollars
every year--in addition to the savings in time and transportation if
they can get those prescriptions filled while they are at the grocery
store or pharmacy or delivered from an online pharmacy. Unlike with
human medications, with our pets, the prescriber also dispenses the
medication prescribed--setting up a conflict of interest whereby the
prescriber is both a health care provider and a retailer.
In testimony in 2016, the FTC stated that ``we believe that the
greater prescription portability likely would enhance competition for
the sale of pet medications and that consumers would benefit from this
competition in the form of lower prices.'' Do you agree with this
conclusion?
Answer. While I do not have detailed knowledge of the pet
medication market and industry structure, as a general matter, a
healthy, competitive market is one where consumers can shop and compare
product features and prices easily across sellers. If confirmed, I look
forward to exploring this issue further, as well as opportunities to
benefit consumers and competition in this market.
Question 10. The prescribing and dispensing of human medications
has long been separated. With eyeglasses and contact lenses, where
prescribers also sell the products they prescribe, Federal law grants
consumers the right to their prescriptions. Why should it be any
different for pet owners with regards to medications for their pets?
Answer. I do not have detailed knowledge of the pet medication
market and industry structure, but you raise an important question
about whether a consumer has the ability to easily obtain a
prescription and shop for the best products and prices. I look forward
to further exploring this issue and consulting with your office and
other stakeholders, if confirmed.
Question 11. Manufacturers of pet medications can, and do offer
inducements to veterinary clinics to prescribe and sell their
medications. Do you think the public, and pet owners who spend billions
of dollars annually on prescription pet medications have a right to
know whether their vet clinic is receiving payments from the
manufacturers of drugs that clinic prescribes?
Answer. As a general matter, transparency contributes to a
properly-functioning marketplace, and I look forward to further
exploring this issue and consulting with your office and other
stakeholders, if confirmed.
Question 12. In 2003, Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act (``FCLCA'') to grant the 40 million Americans who wear
contact lens wearers the right to copies of their prescriptions. The
law also established a process for consumers to have their
prescriptions verified when they purchase their lenses from a retailer
other than the prescriber.
On September 3, 2015, the FTC launched its ten-year review of the
Contact Lens Rule. The comment period closed on October 26, 2015, after
the Commission received over 660 comments from a wide variety of
stakeholders including optometrists, ophthalmologists, consumers,
contact lens manufacturers and third-party contact lens sellers such as
big box stores and online retailers.
On December 7, 2016, the Commission issued a Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (``NPRM'') concluding that ``compliance with the automatic
prescription release provision could be substantially improved.'' This
is consistent with the comments of 20 State Attorneys General who
reported to the Commission that: ``[t]he States are aware, from their
enforcement efforts and collective experience, that not all patients
receive their prescription in writing as a matter of course.'' The NPRM
also proposed the common sense solutions of having consumers sign an
acknowledgement that they have received their prescriptions and
clarifying the right of consumers and their chosen retailers to receive
additional copies of those prescriptions.
If confirmed, will you prioritize finalizing this proposed rule, to
help ensure all consumers will receive copies of their prescriptions,
as Congress intended? Considering FTC's limited resources, and the
significant resources that would be required to take action against
individual prescribers who are not in compliance with this requirement
under the current rule, do you agree that the FTC's proposed rule is an
efficient means of promoting compliance?
Answer. I appreciate concerns that the rulemaking process related
to the contact lens market has been ongoing for an extended period of
time. I also understand that the FTC will host a workshop to gather
additional input next month. If confirmed, I am committed to closely
reviewing the proposal and the public feedback to ensure that any
changes to the rule are finalized in a timely manner.
Question 13. The FTC has not pursued any enforcement activity under
the Military Lending Act, despite having the authority to enforce this
important protection. If confirmed, would you support vigorous
enforcement of the MLA?
Answer. Yes. It has been more than a decade since the Department of
Defense's Report on Predatory Lending Practices Directed at Members of
the Armed Forces and Their Dependents submitted to Congress. The report
noted that ``[p]redatory lending undermines military readiness, harms
the morale of troops and their families, and adds to the cost of
fielding an all-volunteer fighting force.'' The report specifically
noted that the Department of Defense needed the assistance of Federal
and state enforcement agencies.
If confirmed, I plan to closely examine the agency's activities to
promote compliance with the MLA.
______
Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Brian Schatz to
Rohit Chopra
Question 1. The February 2013, the Federal Trade Commission
published a report that found that five percent of consumers had errors
on their credit reports that could result in less favorable terms for
loans.
Based on that study, do you think the consumer reporting agencies
(CRAs) comply with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)'s requirement
to ``follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy''
of credit reports? (15 USC 1681e(b))
Answer. Since credit reports are used by prospective creditors,
employers, landlords, and others, errors can have a major impact on a
family's financial life. Ensuring high levels of accuracy is important
for the entire marketplace.
The FCRA creates obligations for both furnishers and CRAs. Both of
these parties have an impact on accuracy. Addressing accuracy and
dispute resolution issues should be a priority in FCRA enforcement.
Question 2. Do you think the FTC should conduct a follow-up study
to see if error rates have improved?
Answer. The FTC published a series of reports pursuant to the Fair
and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003. The final report in this
series was issued in 2015.
While I do think error rates are worthy of further study, I would
not want resources to be taken away from important FCRA enforcement
work. This is certainly worth considering, and, if confirmed, I look
forward to working with the FTC's staff to ensure the agency is
adequately addressing an issue that impacts millions of Americans.
Question 3. If error rates continue to impact millions of
Americans, what actions should the FTC take to enforce compliance with
the FCRA?
Answer. The FTC shares enforcement authority under the FCRA with
the CFPB and the states. If confirmed, I expect the FTC to play a
leading role in credit reporting issues to ensure that any illegal
practices are addressed.
Question 4. Do you think the policies and practices of CRAs to
handle consumer disputes are in compliance with the FCRA?
Answer. As I noted in the hearing, consumers are not able to vote
with their feet in this market. This might contribute to concerns about
the dispute resolution and investigation process. If confirmed, I look
forward to working with the agency's staff to address the consumer
dispute issues that continue to persist in the market and to take
appropriate enforcement actions when the law is being violated.
Question 5. In 2015, the New York Attorney General reached a
groundbreaking settlement with the three national consumer reporting
agencies--Experian, Equifax, and TransUnion. The terms of the
settlement require the CRAs to do more to ensure maximum possible
accuracy of credit reports and to improve the dispute resolution
process for consumers.
Do you think the terms of the settlement regarding dispute
resolution represent best practices for CRAs' compliance with the
FCRA's requirement that CRAs conduct a ``reasonable reinvestigation''
if the consumer disputes the accuracy of the information in his or her
credit report? (15 USC 1681i)
Answer. This is a very important question. There have been
longstanding concerns that CRAs and furnishers may not have adequate
incentive to sufficiently investigate disputes.
The 2015 nationwide settlement with the New York Attorney General,
as well as the subsequent settlement with 31 additional states, were
certainly important developments in FCRA compliance and consumer
disputes.
It may be too early to tell whether the settlement terms represent
``best practices.'' If confirmed, I would be interested in working with
FTC staff, the CFPB, and the states to see how these practices are
being implemented and whether or not it is working.
Question 6. Can the FTC use its current authorities to hold CRAs to
higher standards when it comes to handling consumer disputes?
Answer. This is a worthwhile issue to explore, and, if confirmed, I
would like to look into this further.
Question 7. What are your views on the adequacy of the Fair Credit
Reporting Act enforcement regime?
Answer. Given the pervasive impact of credit reporting issues on
consumers and many sectors of the economy, FCRA compliance and
enforcement is critical. The FTC has long been a leader in this work.
I support ongoing enforcement by the states, the CFPB, and the FTC.
Importantly, FCRA applies not just to CRAs, but also to furnishers, so
there is a great deal of oversight to conduct. As the FCRA approaches
its 50th anniversary, I believe the FTC should work with Congress to
provide any appropriate analysis or technical advice to identify
opportunities to enhance compliance.
Question 8. What are your views on the inclusion of medical debt in
credit reports?
Answer. My views on this topic have been shaped by empirical
analysis and personal experience.
The 2014 study by the CFPB on medical debt and credit reporting
revealed many interesting insights. Nearly half of all collections
trade lines reported in consumer credit reports are related to medical
debt. There were roughly 1,400 different debt collectors furnishing
this information to the CRAs. The median unpaid amount was
approximately $200. Overwhelmingly, this negative credit reporting was
due to unpaid bills for medical services, not unpaid bills for medical
loans. The CFPB analysis also revealed that credit scoring models were
overly punitive to consumers with medical debt in collections. In other
words, having unpaid medical debt was not necessarily predictive of
being a risky borrower for other types of credit.
I also have personal experience navigating complex health insurance
and provider billing and reimbursement arrangements, leading to a
seemingly-endless game of ping pong to resolve a medical bill. I was
recently sent to collections due to a billing code issue that was not
resolved by my provider and insurance company. Despite having
considerable expertise in credit reporting and debt collection, I have
spent many hours trying to guard against damage to my credit report.
Many consumers might simply give up and pay a bill they do not
legitimately owe.
This past September, the three nationwide credit reporting agencies
announced that they would not include medical debt on consumer credit
reports for 180 days before showing it as past due. While I have not
reached any firm conclusions about whether medical debt should be
excluded altogether, I do believe this is an ongoing issue that
policymakers must confront.
Question 9. Consumers have the right to inspect their credit
reports every year. Do you think they should also have the right to
inspect their credit score?
Answer. I am quite pleased that many of the Nation's largest credit
card issuers have started to offer cardholders the ability to check
their credit score for free on their websites. This makes sense, since
the issuers are already collecting these scores on a regular basis for
account monitoring purposes. Sharing this data with consumers has
surely been valuable for many. At the same time, many consumers do not
have credit cards or any credit products at all, but their credit
scores impact their financial lives.
I think there is merit to ensuring that all consumers have the
right to know their credit score without excessive cost. If confirmed,
I would be open to exploring this issue further with FTC staff,
interested stakeholders, and your office.
Question 10. Do you think the credit reporting market is
functioning well? In your view, what areas could be improved?
Answer. There are many aspects of the market that need improvement,
and many of the ongoing concerns stem from consumers' lack of market
power. As I have previously noted, consumers are not the customer to
credit reporting agencies. In addition, many creditors experience pain
points with credit reporting issues, as errors and inaccuracy also
impact them negatively. It is also very unclear as to whether credit
reporting agencies have adequate incentives to safeguard sensitive
consumer data. If confirmed, I look forward to continued dialogue on
issues facing this important market.
Question 11. Do you think it is sound public policy for consumers
to have to pay to freeze their credit report?
Answer. In a world of increasing cyber risks and data breaches, it
is worth exploring whether it makes sense for consumers to pay to
freeze their credit report, especially when their personal information
has been exposed.
Question 12. Do you think it is confusing for consumers to
understand the difference between freezes, which are defined by and
regulated under state law, and the CRAs' various ``lock'' products,
which fall outside of the protection of state law?
Answer. Yes.
Question 13. Should the FTC have the authority to ensure compliance
with the Safeguards Rule?
Answer. The FTC currently has authority under the Gramm-Leach-
Bliley Act to ensure compliance with the Safeguards Rule for nonbank
financial institutions. I believe this should be maintained.
While the FTC has authority to ensure compliance, many observers
have noted that the Act and the Safeguards Rule may not have robust
consequences for noncompliance by nonbank financial institutions. If
confirmed, I look forward to working closely with staff, stakeholders,
and your office on this.
Question 14. Do you think the FTC has the right expertise and
capacity to investigate and evaluate algorithms for unfair, deceptive,
fraudulent consumer practices in the marketplace?
Answer. My understanding is that the FTC has in-house expertise on
these issues, but I am not certain whether it has adequate resources to
do so. If confirmed, I am happy to explore this issue further.
Question 15. Will you prioritize bringing in additional technical
talent to strengthen FTC's mission in the digital domain?
Answer. Yes. I believe the FTC should recruit the best and
brightest, and drawing experts with technical knowledge in the digital
domain is critical. At the same time, I recognize that it can be
challenging to attract these workers, but I think the FTC should make a
concerted effort to do so.
Question 16. What are your views of the FTC's ability to ensure
adequate oversight of online privacy? Please include your perspective
on the FTC's expertise and the adequacy of the regulatory tools
available to it. What specific actions would you propose the FTC
undertake to improve online privacy?
Answer. The FTC does not enforce a comprehensive privacy law that
cuts across all sectors. With respect to online privacy, the FTC's
authority generally stems from Section 5 of the FTC Act, as well as
discrete statutes such as COPPA. This is an important issue, and, if
confirmed, I look forward to further exploring what can be done to
improve online privacy.
Question 17. The FCC's Net Neutrality order is premised upon ISPs
disclosing voluntary policies and the FTC enforcing compliance with
those polices. Do you agree that the FTC's authority only extends to
enforcing a company's compliance with whatever policy the company
issues? If not, please explain.
Answer. While I would need to consult further with FTC staff on
this, it is worth noting the FTC has often asserted deception claims
with respect to representations made to consumers. If a company
discloses how it collects and uses personal data or prioritizes certain
content, that might be material when seeking to determine whether there
was a violation of law.
Question 18. If the Ninth Circuit's decision in FTC v. AT&T
Mobility is allowed to stand, what authority, if any, will the FTC
retain to enforce these company policies?
Answer. If the ruling from the en banc review concurs with the
ruling of the initial panel, it may be difficult for the FTC to ensure
there is a level playing field if common carriers and others are
competing in the same market.
Question 19. What is your view of the propriety of the FTC imposing
conditions on proposed mergers as compared with suing to block a deal?
How would you evaluate when to use one or the other?
Answer. The choice to settle or sue is a challenging one for every
Federal enforcement agency. At times, it may be in the public interest
to conserve resources and avoid litigation through settlement. With
respect to proposed mergers, agencies can sometimes mitigate
anticompetitive concerns outside of litigation. Other matters may be
more appropriate for litigation.
One significant advantage of litigation is that there tends to be
greater transparency to the public about the facts and the issues at
hand. It will be important for the FTC to have adequate resources to
litigate when appropriate, while also seeking to be as transparent as
possible when resolving a matter via settlement.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tom Udall to
Rohit Chopra
Question 1. What are your ideas how to promote consumer protection
in an increasingly online--and connected--world?
Do you believe that the current FTC enforcement principles are
sufficient to protect consumers? And do you believe the FTC has the
resources necessary to protect consumers given the significant amount
of work on the docket for the agency?
Answer. While the FTC has the authority to bring enforcement
actions to protect consumers, I am not fully certain at this time that
the FTC has adequate resources to address the wide range of consumer
protection and competition issues that face consumers and the
marketplace.
If confirmed, I will work with my fellow Commissioners and agency
staff to closely assess the adequacy of agency resources.
Question 2. In December, I wrote to the FTC, along with Senators
Schumer and Blumenthal, asking for a workshop to discuss the increased
use of ``bots'' to purchase large quantities of in-demand toys and
items, particularly at Christmas. The FTC has confirmed that it will
engage with key stakeholders to determine if a workshop is necessary.
Will you commit to reviewing the record on this issue and to working
with my office to determine next steps, including the possibility of
legislation?
Answer. ``Bots'' are an emerging area of concern for both consumers
and sellers of goods and services. The FTC already has authority to
address certain practices related to ``bots'' in the buying and selling
of tickets to performances and events. This seems to be an area worthy
of further review, and I look forward to working with your office on
this, if confirmed.
Question 3. Last week, an article in TechCrunch showed how Facebook
uses data from Onavo Protect, a subsidiary app, to gather data on its
competitors; how Google uses its search rankings to demote alternate
competitive sites; and Amazon's aggressive low pricing undercuts book
publishers. Under your respective leadership, how will the FTC enforce
the principles of unfair methods of competition against tech giants
like Facebook, Google and Amazon to promote consumer welfare?
Answer. Every year, the technology sector has grown in scale and
scope, competing with sectors across the economy. Without speaking to
any specific company, investigation, or matter, as a general rule, I
believe the FTC should use all of its law enforcement tools to ensure
that incumbents are not violating antitrust laws and should vigorously
pursue any violations.
Question 4. Following the FTC's approval of the Google/DoubleClick
acquisition in 2007, then Commissioner Pamela Jones Harbor released a
dissent detailing the need for the commission to ``evaluate the
implication of this kind of data merger from a competition as well as a
consumer protection perspective.'' As commissioner, how would you use
this framing of data mergers in evaluating mergers and acquisitions in
the technology industry?
Answer. Big data has significant implications for the FTC consumer
protection, privacy, and competition work. Data is now seen as a key
asset for firms to gain a competitive advantage. When evaluating
mergers, it will be important for the agency to carefully analyze the
role of data assets in a particular transaction.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Tammy Duckworth to
Rohit Chopra
Question 1. At the Consumer Federation of America, military
families are one of your main focuses. If confirmed, are you committed
to prioritizing consumer protection enforcement where active-duty
servicemembers, Veterans, survivors and their families have been
targeted by bad actors and if so, can you list your top priorities with
respect to military consumer protection?
Answer. In previous Congressional testimony, I have described
military consumer protection issues as a ``canary in the coal mine.''
Of course, the military community warrants support from across Federal
agencies, but fraud and misconduct targeted at the military is often a
harbinger for risks to the broader civilian population.
As a general matter, I have observed that Federal agencies are
quick to tout their commitment to the military, but slower to do the
serious work and analysis to determine the specific needs across
various military population segments. For example, members of the
Reserves face different issues compared to, say, elderly veterans or
surviving military spouses. I am confident the FTC can do the work
necessary to understand the range of issues as they relate to these
specific segments.
At this point, I can say that I am particularly concerned about a
few specific areas: benefits-related fraud targeted at veterans, data
collection and privacy issues in the active-duty community, and quality
of outreach by Federal agencies to members of the National Guard.
Question 2. What additional relevant experience do you bring with
respect to protecting military consumers?
Answer. While at the U.S. Department of Education and the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau, I was fortunate to work extensively on
military consumer protection issues.
In 2012, I co-authored a report with Mrs. Holly Petraeus that
uncovered an overcharging scheme targeted at military families with
student loans. The report led to substantial changes in industry
practice. After a referral to and coordination with the Justice
Department, violators of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act were fined
$60 million and refunds were provided to 78,000 servicemembers.
I was also closely involved in working with state Attorneys General
to shut down GIBill.com, a deceptive website targeting veterans. The
bipartisan group of 20 state AGs fined the operator of the website, and
ownership of the website was turned over to the Department of Veterans
Affairs as part of a settlement.
While at the CFPB, my office also led the development of many
consumer tools for military consumers, including student loan repayment
calculators and guides for servicemembers seeking to pay for college.
I was also fortunate to be invited by the Department of Defense to
offer seminars at many large military installations and to present at
the DOD's Worldwide Education Symposium. These events provided
opportunities for consumer education and to hear about issues faced by
active-duty servicemembers. I have also lectured at the Judge Advocate
General Legal Center & School and worked closely with many JAGs who
assist servicemembers on debt collection, auto lending, and many other
consumer issues.
Question 3. A few months ago, when writing about what military
families should do in the wake of the Equifax data breach, you
estimated that military consumers report identity theft at double the
rate of the civilian population. Why do you think this is, and what is
your assessment of the FTC's work-to-date to protect military
consumers?
Answer. While the FTC does not release granular data on the
military community's complaints about identity theft, there are many
potential explanations. One potential explanation is that many active-
duty servicemembers face frequent Permanent Change of Station (PCS)
orders. These frequent moves can prevent a military family from
spotting early warning signs, such as suspicious credit alerts or
account openings.
Some servicemembers and their families have shared that they are
often separated from their immediate and extended families for long
periods of time, making digital communication a critical way to stay in
touch. However, some are concerned that they might be inadvertently
exposing sensitive information about themselves, potentially
contributing to identity theft.
Like all agencies, I think the FTC can always do better to serve
military consumers. If confirmed, I hope to work with my fellow
Commissioners and the staff to advance this work.
Question 4. When Congress passed the Fairness to Contact Lens
Consumers Act in 2004 it helped reduce barriers to retail competition
in the contact lens market and led to lower prices for consumers.
However, contact retailers sometimes sell patients contact lenses after
the prescription has expired or fail to adequately verify the
prescription in accordance to FCLCA. In some cases, this has led to
dangerous eye and health conditions for the patient. How can the FTC
work in coordination with the FDA, CDC and other Federal agencies to
make sure contact lens patients are receiving high quality care and
safe contact lenses?
Answer. To ensure that the FCLCA is meeting its intended goals, the
FTC should consult with stakeholders and other agencies to gain
feedback where appropriate.
Question 5. In December 2016, the FTC issued a proposed change to
the current Contact Lens Rule that mandated that all eye doctors obtain
a signed acknowledgement form from each of their contact lens patients
when they receive a copy of their prescription. Do you know of any
other ways for patients to understand their right to their contact lens
prescription that would be just as, if not, more effective than a
written acknowledgement?
Answer. I understand that the FTC will host a workshop to gather
additional input next month. If confirmed, I am committed to closely
reviewing the proposal and the public feedback to ensure that any
changes to the rule are finalized in a timely manner and that patients
understand their rights in the most effective and efficient way
possible.

Response to Written Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
to Rohit Chopra
Question 1. Restoring Internet Freedom FCC-FTC MOU
Within the net neutrality MOU, signed between the FCC and FTC,
regarding the FTC's authority it states: ``Congress has directed the
FTC to, among other things, prevent unfair methods of competition and
unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.''
Therefore, can you say without reservation that you'll have what
you will need, upon being confirmed at the FTC, to actually catch
improper actions taken by Internet service providers toward consumers?
Answer. At this time, I cannot say without reservation that the FTC
has the resources and expertise to prevent unfair methods of
competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices with respect to
Internet service providers. If confirmed, I hope to better determine
whether the FTC is able to meet this task.
Question 2. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
Unfortunately we still don't know the full FTC authority over
common carriers, like in the case pending on AT&T, so I would like to
hear what you anticipate will be FTC's authority going forward.
Answer. As you note, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit will review en banc the three-judge panel's ruling in a pending
case in which the FTC is a party. If the Court upholds the ruling of
the panel, this will present significant challenges in creating a level
playing field in the broadband Internet market.
Question 3. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
How you can ensure the FTC will even have the authority to enforce
the limited principles covered in Chairman Pai's weak form of net
neutrality?
Answer. Rules and orders under the Communications Act are generally
not enforced by the Federal Trade Commission, so I can not be certain
how this will play out in practice.
Question 4. Court Case on FTC Authority over ``Common Carriers''
And I would ask if you can provide me a true commitment to act on
behalf of consumers who are impacted by less than fair practices by
some in the telecommunications industry.
Answer. Regardless of what Congress and the Courts decide with
respect to net neutrality, I am committed to using any appropriate
authorities available to the FTC to protect consumers.
Question 5. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
Can you please define for me what the lead telecommunications
policy expert Federal agency is, in your opinion?
Answer. The Federal Communications Commission is seen by both the
industry and policymakers around the world as America's primary
telecommunications expert agency.
Question 6. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
Have you specifically recently read the MOU on net neutrality
between the FCC and FTC, and do you support it in its entirety?
Answer. Yes, I have read the December 2017 MOU. Without having
access to certain nonpublic information on ongoing investigations and
consumer complaints, it is difficult to determine whether the
provisions in the MOU are sufficient.
Question 7. Broad Positions on FTC's Place on Net Neutrality
What is your understanding of the capacity of the staff currently
at the FTC, and do you think you can effectively execute this agreement
enough to garner true public trust in ensuring a truly free and open
internet?
Answer. My understanding is that the FTC may not have a large bench
of technical experts on telecommunications. If confirmed, assessing the
agency's capabilities so it can execute its enforcement
responsibilities will be a priority.
Question 8. Broadband Internet Speed Honesty
I am aware that various state Attorneys General are concerned that
a telecomm industry petition to the FCC on cost transparency, related
to the advertisement of Internet speeds, quote ``represents nothing
more than the industry's effort to shield itself from state law
enforcement.''
Given the FTC's mission regarding deceptive practices, can you
speak to your perspective on whether this is fair consumer protection
issue to be concerned about at FTC, given the prices and promises ISPs
make to generate more business?
Answer. While I am not deeply familiar with this petition, the FTC
does have expertise on marketing and advertising practices that may be
valuable resources in this discussion.
Question 9. Deceptive Advertising
When someone takes out a loan, or goes to buy a car or a reverse
mortgage, they should be treated fairly. Unfortunately, that does not
always happen. Some people have a profit model that is based on
overcharging people. The FTC investigates and fines firms that engage
in deceptive advertising. In previous years, the FTC has fined firms
that misled people into taking out high-cost auto loans, overpaying
debt collection agencies or taking out reverse mortgages. The FTC also
took action against colleges like DeVry University that misled students
on the likelihood of employment within six months of graduation.
How do you see the FTC continuing to work with the Consumer
Financial Protection Bureau to take action against companies that
intentionally mislead auto buyers, students and elderly homeowners?
Answer. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has deep technical
expertise in mortgage, auto, and student lending markets among its
policy experts, economists, and attorneys. The FTC should continue to
work closely with the CFPB on law enforcement, consumer education, and
in other areas of shared interest.
Question 10. FTC Investigation on GPS tracking of Vehicles
Last year it was revealed that the Federal Trade Commission is
investigating GPS tracking technologies used in the subprime auto loan
industry, but my understanding is that no findings or rulings have been
released. Going back as far 2014, the New York Times had highlighted
this as a concern. In their piece, they highlighted a troubling story
of a mother in Las Vegas, Mary Bolender, who needed to get her child
with a 103.5-degree fever to the ER, but her 2005 Chrysler van wouldn't
start. As the piece says--``The cause was not a mechanical problem--it
was her lender.''
Now I have a number of concerns with their as a business practice,
but can I get a commitment from you to continue to look into this issue
and publically provide information on your findings and enforcement
determinations in a timely manner?
Answer. Subprime auto lenders frequently make use of GPS trackers
and kill switches, which has reduced the cost of repossession and may
be meaningfully impacting the auto lending market. I am committed to
transparently communicating any findings and determinations, to the
extent permissible by law.
Question 11. Auto Loans
There have long been problems with deceptive advertising in auto
sales. Two years ago, the FTC took action against two Las Vegas auto
dealers, Planet Nissan and Planet Hyundai, which ran ads touting sales,
lease or financing options that seemed attractive but were cancelled
out by fine-print disclaimers.
I know when you were with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau,
there were also problems with some lenders charging higher interest
rates to Latinos and African Americans than whites, even when they had
the same income and credit score.
What role do you think the FTC should play to make sure that auto
buyers are not the victims of deceptive advertising or overcharged
because of their ethnicity?
Answer. Protecting auto buyers and auto loan borrowers from
discrimination is somewhat complex. The CFPB has rulemaking authority
under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) as codified by Regulation
B. However, with respect to auto dealers, I believe the authority to
amend Regulation B lies with the Federal Reserve Board of Governors.
The FTC shares enforcement jurisdiction with the CFPB under ECOA
with respect to nonbanks, except that the CFPB does not have
enforcement jurisdiction under ECOA for auto dealers.
Separately, the FTC has the authority to prescribe rules regarding
unfair or deceptive acts or practices with respect to auto dealer
financing.
If confirmed, I am committed to consulting with staff to better
understand the FTC's existing work to protecting consumers from
discrimination in this market.
Question 12. Reverse Mortgages
Reverse mortgages are products sold to seniors to help them ``age-
in-place'' and use their home equity as a means by which to responsibly
pay their bills. Reverse mortgages can be sensible products, but
sometimes have been falsely advertised to seniors. The FTC and the
Consumer Financial Protection Bureau conducted a ``sweep'' of reverse
mortgage advertisements, and a review of consumer complaints, and found
that three reverse mortgage companies engaged in deceptive advertising
which misled consumers.
Given the overlapping jurisdictions between the Consumer Financial
Protection Bureau and the FTC, can you discuss how you envision the two
entities work together to combat financial fraud, specifically scams
impacting seniors?
Answer. Given the increasing population of senior citizens in
America, reverse mortgage fraud will likely continue to be an ongoing
concern. Congress required the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to
prepare a report on Reverse Mortgages that detailed many consumer
protection issues associated with this product.
Pursuant to the Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution Act, the FTC
has designated an Elder Justice Coordinator responsible for
coordinating and supporting the enforcement and consumer education
efforts and policy activities of the FTC on elder justice issues.
Similarly, Congress also established an Office for the Financial
Protection of Older Americans within the CFPB, which engages in
consumer education and market analysis on issues facing older
Americans. If confirmed, I look forward to facilitating continued
coordination between the FTC and the CFPB on enforcement, consumer
education, and other efforts.
Question 13. Merger Review Commitment
With increased multi-industry players growing in prominence by
acquiring more businesses outside their core business model, can you
commit to reviewing the horizontal merger guidelines, which have not
directly addressed vertical mergers since 1984?
Answer. I believe that agencies should review official guidance and
interpretations on a regular basis. Whenever possible, this should
include public input. If confirmed, I will work with my fellow
Commissioners and the agency's staff to explore this idea.
