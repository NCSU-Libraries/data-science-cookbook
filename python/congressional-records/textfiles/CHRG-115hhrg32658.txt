----------
THURSDAY, APRIL 12, 2018
House of Representatives,
Committee on House Administration,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to call, at 11:05 a.m., in Room
1310, Longworth House Office Building, Hon. Gregg Harper
[Chairman of the Committee] presiding.
Present: Representatives Harper, Davis, Comstock, Walker,
Loudermilk, Brady, Lofgren, and Raskin.
Staff Present: Sean Moran, Staff Director; Kim Betz, Deputy
Staff Director/General Counsel; Cole Felder, Deputy General
Counsel; Dan Jarrell, Legislative Clerk; Erin McCracken,
Communications Director; Jamie Fleet, Minority Staff Director;
Khalil Abboud, Minority Deputy Staff Director; and Eddie
Flaherty, Minority Chief Clerk.
The Chairman. I now call to order the Committee on House
Administration for purposes of today's Committee meeting. A
quorum is present, so we may proceed. The meeting record will
remain open for 5 legislative days, so that Members may submit
any materials they wish to be included therein.
There are two items on the docket today: H.R. 5305, the
Federal Depository Library Program Modernization Act of 2018;
and H.R. 4631, the Access to Congressionally Mandated Reports
Act. H.R. 5305, the Federal Depository Library Program
Modernization Act of 2018, reflects the Committee's work over
the last year, which included holding five hearings and three
bipartisan stakeholder meetings. In examining potential reforms
to the Federal Depository Library Program, the Committee found
the free flow of government information is fundamental to a
democratic society, and members of the public have a right of
access to government information. The Federal Depository
Library Program, or FDLP as it is commonly known, is an
essential service by which members of the public can access
government information. These libraries partner with the
Government Publishing Office, and offices of the Federal
Government to ensure that members of the public, throughout the
United States, have effective, no-fee access to government
information.
Most government information currently produces an
electronic format. As a result, 97 percent of new information
available through FDLP is in that electronic format. The
government has a responsibility to disseminate and provide
permanent public access to information to ensure that members
of the public are fully aware of the activities of their
government, to spur innovation and research, and to promote
good government. And the sole focus of the Superintendent of
Documents should be on implementing programs to ensure no-fee
access to government information.
To that end, H.R. 5305 makes the following changes to the
FDLP; it recognizes existence of a national collection of
information dissemination products; it updates the types of
depository libraries across the country that may participate in
FDLP; it eliminates the problems with fugitive documents in the
government; it allows the FDLP to accept work completed by the
library community; it provides for greater transparency in the
FDLP itself; and it removes the sales program from the purview
of the superintendent of documents to allow the superintendent
to focus on no-fee access to government information.
The bill is supported by the major library associations,
including the American Library Association, the American
Association of Law Libraries, the Association of Research
Libraries, and the Chief Officers of State Library Agencies.
The second bill on the docket is H.R. 4631, the Access to
Congressionally Mandated Reports Act. H.R. 4631 was introduced
by our colleague, Representative Quigley from Illinois. In
short, H.R. 4631 also amends Title 44 by requiring the
Government Publishing Office, or GPO, to, among other things,
establish and maintain a publicly available website containing
copies of all congressionally mandated reports. The bill also
directs the Office of Management and Budget to issue guidance
to Federal agencies to assist them in submitting the reports to
GPO.
The bill was marked up and reported out of the Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform earlier this year. Forty-five
organizations support this bipartisan legislation. I am pleased
the Committee on House Administration is acting on this good
government bill as well.
I will now like to recognize my colleague and the
Committee's Ranking Member, Mr. Brady, for purposes of an
opening statement, if he wishes.
Mr. Brady. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for calling this
business meeting this morning. I support both proposals before
us and the bipartisan work they represent.
H.R. 5305 is good for the Government Publishing Office, it
is good for the taxpayers, and most important to me, it is good
for Philadelphia. I was very pleased to receive a letter from
Temple University supporting this legislation.
Federal Depository Library Program plays an important role
in our democratic process and helps the American public stay
informed and hold its government accountable. I know Committee
staff on both sides of the aisle worked hard on this, and I
would like to thank Khalil Abboud from my staff and Bob Tapella
on the majority staff for all the efforts that went into this
legislation.
Thank you.
H.R. 4631 is a positive step towards increasing
transparency in how the Federal Government operates. While
congressional committees emphasize oversight on the executive
branch, ultimately, we all answer to the American people, and
they have a right to know how their tax dollars are being
spent, what is working, and what are areas that need
improvement. These reports provide a unique insight into these
questions though they are not always easy to find.
This legislation will create a one-stop shop for
congressional mandated reports, and I am proud to support it.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back the balance of my
time.
The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Brady.
I would ask if any other Member of the Committee wishes to
be recognized for purposes of providing an opening statement.
Seeing none, I now call up and--oh, I am sorry.
Ms. Lofgren. I just want to be very brief. You know, the
House Administration Committee is a work-a-day Committee and
doesn't always get the attention for, you know, a variety of
reasons. But this is really significant, and I want to give
credit to both you and Mr. Brady and all the other Committee
members. Because in a democratic society, knowledge is power.
And so what we are doing today is to give additional access to
knowledge to the American public to enhance their authority.
And I just think it is important to view this and the
subsequent bill in that light. And I just wanted to note that
and how significant this really is.
And I yield back.
The Chairman. Thank you, Ms. Lofgren, for your support and
your comments as well.
Any other Members?
I now call up and lay before the Committee, H.R. 5305, the
FDLP Modernization Act of 2018. Without objection, the bill is
considered read. And the amendment in the nature of a
substitute provided to each of you will serve as the base text
and is considered open for amendment at any point.
[The bill follows:]
