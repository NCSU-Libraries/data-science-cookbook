ROUNDTABLE PERSPECTIVES ON
PROTECTING THE ELECTRIC GRID FROM
AN ELECTROMAGNETIC PULSE OR GEOMAGNETIC DISTURBANCE
----------
WEDNESDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 2019
U.S. Senate,
Committee on Homeland Security
and Governmental Affairs,
Washington, DC.
The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:31 p.m., in
room SD-106, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Ron Johnson,
Chairman of the Committee, presiding.
Present: Senators Johnson, Peters, Hassan, Harris, and
Rosen.
Also present: Senator Toomey.
OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JOHNSON
Chairman Johnson. Good afternoon. I guess I will gavel in
the roundtable.
First of all, thank you all for taking the time to come to
participate in this roundtable, for your thoughtful testimony.
I have read all of it. I have read some of it a couple of
times.
I reached out to a couple of you, as well, trying to do
some summaries.
Because we have so many participants--normally, we would
offer about 5 minutes' worth of opening statements, but what I
think we want to do is keep it to 2 minutes. So be thinking
right now about the top priorities of the points you wanted to
make in this roundtable, and then I told my staff to keep my
time open. I know one participant is going to have to catch a
flight, but I am going to sit here until my questions are
answered, until my curiosity is satiated.
I would ask that my written statement be entered in the
record.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The prepared statement of Senator Johnson appears in the
Appendix on page 45.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The only point I want to make is I have been working on
this issue now for probably 6 years, and the level of
frustration is hard to describe.
The threats I believe this Nation faces with any kind of
high-altitude nuclear explosion causing electromagnetic pulse
(EMP) or a high-intensity solar storm in terms of geomagnetic
disturbances (GMD) and the threat that poses to our
infrastructure and literally our very way of life, it is just
hard to overstate.
I think, certainly, before I really started delving into
this, I was like most Americans, either largely unaware or I
heard about this and go, oh, it is just science fiction. That
would never happen. We are not going to see Mad Max and
Thunderdome, OK?
The frustration is there is such a broad spectrum of
opinion here. I am not an electrical engineer. I am not a
technical expert on this. I am an accountant. I am a business
guy, but I have had that process of solving problems, which is
gathering information, doing root-cause analysis, properly
defining the problem, trying to establish achievable goals.
What drives me nuts about this is nobody agrees on the
information. You have really smart people, and there is a broad
spectrum.
So what I find interesting about this roundtable is I think
we have some really good testimony. I think we can zero in on
some action items so that we can hopefully establish some
achievable goals.
By the way, I am talking about actionable achievable goals.
We have for far too long talked about developing a strategy, to
develop a strategy, to develop a plan. ``Let us do more
research,'' and then we just elongate the time period before we
actually start doing something concrete to start mitigating
what could be a horrific catastrophe. I never want to be
sitting here in the dark saying, ``I told you so.'' I want to
start taking action as quickly as possible.
I want to thank Senator Peters and Senator Rosen for
showing up; I thank Senator Toomey, not on our Committee. I
want to thank Senator Murkowski. Most of the law that we would
have to write would probably come under her jurisdiction, so I
hope her staff is here.
We have to work together collaboratively on this thing. We
have to find the areas of agreement to address what again would
just be a cataclysmic-type event, either space weather or the
growing threats from some of these rogue States that have
probably the capability of detonating something that could
cause a lot of harm.
So, with that, I will turn it over to Senator Peters before
we let all of you go through, and we will just go around the
table, ask you to state your name, what is the organization
that you are representing, and then just kind of hit your high
points. Then it is going to be a free-for-all. We are not going
to do this normally, where it is 7 minutes or whatever, because
otherwise it becomes too disjointed. I want to be able to
follow a line of questioning, the points being made in somewhat
logical order.
With that, Senator Peters.
OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PETERS\1\
Senator Peters. Well, thank you, Chairman Johnson. I will
be brief as well so we can get to hearing the testimony here.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The prepared statement of Senator Peters appears in the
Appendix on page 47.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I could not agree more with Chairman Johnson that this is a
topic that we need to explore.
I have been focused on one aspect of that, which are the
GMDs, which if you look at whether or not we have an EMP or a
GMD event, the one thing about GMD, I think it is not a
question of if. It is just when. We know that they have
occurred. We know that they have been significant in the past.
They existed before we were all interconnected in the Internet
and with elaborate grids.
If we have another event like Carrington in the 1850s, it
will be much different today than it was back then. I know Dr.
Kasper will be talking about that. I have worked with Dr.
Kasper on this issue for a while, and my friends at the
University of Michigan in the Heliophysics Department and
others have been big advocates for doing something and actually
having action. That we cannot just sit back and not look at
this. This is something that will come eventually, and it could
be absolutely catastrophic if we are not prepared for that.
In order for us to move forward, though, we have to get
everybody on the same page. We have to make sure we all agree
on what the facts are and we all agree on the risks associated
with GMD events or other events, and that we can write some
meaningful legislation.
I did write legislation in the past, the Space Weather
Research and Forecasting Act. That has now passed the Senate
twice, which is great. It has not passed the House,
unfortunately. In this place, you need to have both, and we are
hoping that what we get out of this hearing will give us some
further momentum to get that Act first. Certainly, that bill is
not the end-all, but it gets us on a track where we can start
coordinating activities between all of the various government
agencies and making sure that data is being provided to those
who need to see the data as a result of solar activity.
It is a meaningful step forward, but we have to do a whole
lot more. But in order to get there, the opinions and the facts
and the counsel that we get from all of you here is going to be
absolutely critical.
Thank you for being here today. I look forward to a good
discussion.
Chairman Johnson. We will start with Karen Evans. She
currently serves as the Assistant Secretary for the Office of
Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER)
at the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE).
We have a little 2-minute timer and just trying----
Ms. Evans. I am ready.
Chairman Johnson. Pardon? You are ready, OK. I have the
gavel.
TESTIMONY OF HON. KAREN EVANS,\1\ ASSISTANT SECRETARY,
CYBERSECURITY, ENERGY SECURITY, AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE, U.S.
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY
Ms. Evans. OK. Thank you, Chairman and Ranking Member
Peters, and Members of the Committee. I appreciate the
opportunity to discuss the risks posed.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Evans appears in the Appendix on
page 50.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOE's role in addressing energy sector risks and energy
sector security is well established. From the Department's role
in nuclear security through the National Nuclear Security
Administration (NNSA) to the ground-breaking grid modernization
research at our National Laboratories, DOE has the expertise
and the relationships to support the energy sector and to help
protect its critical infrastructure in coordination with the
Department.
I would like to highlight just a few of our ongoing
projects in this area, which include improving unclassified E3
waveforms, code and databases, to be able to share EMP effects
with our partners; enhancing the Nation's EMP and GMD
capabilities through the Center for EMP and GMD Simulation,
Modeling, Analysis, Research, and Testing (CE-SMART);
implementing a pilot project to field deploy and evaluate
technologies to mitigate the effects of GMD and the E3 from the
EMP on the electric grid.
We also plan to develop a hardening and resilience road map
this year, specifying what we can and should be doing, working
with our industry partners with available resources to deploy
technologies to protect critical components, equipment, and
systems on the electric grid from EMP and GMD effects and
impacts.
DOE is fully committed to help forging the grid of the
future that will be more resilient to all hazards, including
EMP and GMD. Continued progress in the grid modernization is
vital to help us protect the grid from these impacts.
I appreciate the opportunity to be here with the Committee
to discuss the effects of this and participate in the
roundtable, and I applaud your leadership in this area.
Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Ms. Evans. You have set a good
example for everybody else. [Laughter.]
The next witness is Brian Harrell. He currently serves as
the Assistant Director of the Infrastructure Security Division
at the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Mr. Harrell.
TESTIMONY OF BRIAN HARRELL,\1\ ASSISTANT DIRECTOR,
INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY DIVISION, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND
SECURITY
Mr. Harrell. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Peters, and
Members of the Committee, good afternoon, and thank you for the
opportunity to discuss the Department of Homeland Security's
ongoing efforts to secure our Nation's critical infrastructure
against threats from electromagnetic pulse and geomagnetic
disturbances.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Harrell appears in the Appendix
on page 55.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
As a short introduction, I am the Assistant Director for
Infrastructure Security within the Cybersecurity and
Infrastructure Agency within DHS.
I want to thank you all for your leadership in passing the
Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Act of
2018.
I appreciate the interest of this Committee on getting to
the facts regarding threats from EMP and GMD.
While I am new to my current role, I previously served as
the Managing Director of Enterprise Security at Duke Energy. I
am also the former Director of Critical Infrastructure
Protection at the North American Electric Reliability
Corporation. I am very familiar with the risk management
conversation we are discussing today.
The effects of nuclear EMP and GMD on critical
infrastructure are related, but the threat space is very
different and should be discussed separately.
Regarding the threat landscape for nuclear EMP, work
completed by the intelligence community (IC) and the nuclear
weapons community provides specific and period assessment of
the nuclear weapons capabilities of foreign countries,
including the capabilities to generate an EMP.
The intelligence community currently has no specific,
credible information indicating that there is an imminent
threat to critical infrastructure from an EMP attack. However,
the consequences of a successful nuclear EMP attack using a
nuclear weapon detonated at high altitude are potentially
severe and may include long-term damage to significant portions
of the Nation's power grid and communications infrastructure.
Under the joint DHS-DOE funding, the United States nuclear
weapons laboratories have completed a preliminary nuclear EMP
impacts assessment on the Nation's electric power system. This
study developed a spectrum of EMP attack scenarios and
estimates of impacts. Although additional work is required,
this study provides the basis for more advanced risk
assessments in the electric sector and a framework for risk
assessments in other sectors.
DHS, in collaboration with interagency partners, is working
to provide owners and operators of critical infrastructure with
the resulting information and frameworks to help them manage
risks from electromagnetic events.
Regarding the threats landscape from GMD----
Chairman Johnson. Again, I have to discipline this. We have
your written testimony. We can read that. I want to move on.
You do not have to necessarily read these things, off the top
of your head the subject matter. Give us the primary points of
what you are coming here to testify about.
Our next participant will be Nathan Anderson. He is the
Acting Director of the Homeland Security and Justice Team at
the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO). Mr. Anderson.
TESTIMONY OF NATHAN ANDERSON,\1\ ACTING DIRECTOR, HOMELAND
SECURITY AND JUSTICE TEAM, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY
OFFICE
Mr. Anderson. Thank you, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member
Peters, Members of the Committee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Anderson appears in the Appendix
on page 58.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Since 2016, we have issued several reports reviewing
Federal agency actions to address electromagnetic risks.
First, we found in 2016 that DHS, DOE, and the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) had taken actions, such as
establishing industry standards and Federal guidelines and
completing EMP-related research. We found that their actions
aligned with the some of the EMP Commission recommendations.
We also found that opportunities existed to enhance Federal
efforts to coordinate and address electromagnetic risks to the
grid and made several recommendations, most of which have been
implemented.
Second, we reported that electricity suppliers had
identified information on GMD and high-altitude electromagnetic
pulse (HEMP) effects on the grid, and most suppliers we
interviewed had taken some steps to protect against GMD
effects.
U.S. and Canadian suppliers have identified information on
the potential effects of a severe GMD resulting from a solar
storm, but have identified less information about the potential
effects of HEMP events.
Suppliers we interviewed also described the range of costs
incurred to protect against GMD and HEMP, which can range from
minimal costs to 20 percent of such projects' costs.
We also reported on technologies that are available or in
development that could help prevent or mitigate the effects of
GMDs on the grid. They hold promise but are not ready for
widespread operational deployment.
Finally, we found that efforts are under way to address the
likelihood of a large-scale GMD, the risks such storms pose and
potential mitigation measures, which will help inform whether
additional actions are needed to prevent or mitigate the
effects of GMDs on the grid.
Regarding EMP events, we found more research is needed to
fully investigate and evaluate how an electric utility could
protect itself from or mitigate the effects of EMP on its
system.
This concludes my statement.
Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Anderson.
Our next participant is Joseph McClelland, who is the
Director of the Office of Energy Infrastructure Security at the
Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Mr. McClelland.
TESTIMONY OF JOSEPH H. MCCLELLAND,\1\ DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF
ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY, FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY
COMMISSION
Mr. McClelland. Thank you, Chairman Johnson and Ranking
Member Peters, for your leadership and interest in this subject
and with the invitation to this roundtable discussion today.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The prepared statement of Mr. McClelland appears in the
Appendix on page 65.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am here today as a member of the Commission staff, and my
remarks do not necessarily represent the views of the
Commission or any individual Commissioners.
The Commission's authority to oversee the development of
mandatory standards to protect the reliability of the bulk
power system fall under the Federal Power Act. Under this
authority, FERC cannot author or modify reliability standards
but must depend upon an Electric Reliability Organization (ERO)
to perform this task.
The Commission certified the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation (NERC), as the ERO. The ERO develops
and proposes new reliability standards or modifications to
existing standards with industry for the Commission's review,
which it can either approve or remand.
However, the consequences of a severe, naturally occurring
event, or national security threat by entities intent on
attacking the United States by exploiting its vulnerabilities
in its electric grid or using physical or cyber means stands in
stark contrast to major reliability events that have caused
regional blackouts and reliability failures in the past.
Widespread disruption of electric service can undermine the
security of the U.S. Government, its military, the economy, as
well as endanger the health and safety of its citizens.
Given the national security dimension to this thread, it is
imperative that action be taken quickly and effectively to
protect America's infrastructure.
For these reasons, the Commission uses a dualfold approach,
employing both mandatory standards to establish foundational
practices, while also working collaboratively with industry,
the States, and Federal agencies to identify from best
practices to mitigate advanced threats.
Because EMP and GMD events pose a serious threat to the
electric grid and its supporting infrastructure that serve our
Nation, the Commission has found it necessary to use both
standards and a collaborative approach to address these
threats, as is detailed in my written testimony.
Thank you, and I look forward to our discussion.
Chairman Johnson. Thank you.
By the way, we do not have to restate the fact that this
could be catastrophic. We have both said it twice. So focus in
on new information, particularly your agency or the people you
are representing, what are the main points.
Our next participant is Dr. George Baker. Dr. Baker is
currently a professor emeritus at James Madison University. He
previously served as the Senior Advisor to the former
Commission to Assess the Threat to the United States from
Eelectromagnetic Pulse Attack, which is normally called the EMP
Commission. Dr. Baker.
TESTIMONY OF GEORGE BAKER, PH.D,\1\ PROFESSOR EMERITUS, JAMES
MADISON UNIVERSITY
Mr. Baker. Again, thanks for this opportunity and for
holding this roundtable. I think it is very important.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The prepared statement of Dr. Baker appears in the Appendix on
page 73.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
My watch word is ``defense conservative.'' We need to be
defense conservative in everything we do, and the problem I
see, that is not happening.
I have a long list of recommended actions. I will go down
these, and stop me in midcourse, if you want.
I have top-down recommendations, things that need to happen
from the Federal level down and then bottom-up from the local,
State level up.
I would say the most important recommendation of the
Congressional EMP Commission was that we need an office of EMP
coordination within the National Security Council (NSC), and I
am told that is actually part of the Executive Order (EO) that
should come out soon.
The FERC GMD standard, No. TPL-007-2, though its specified
environments and systems thresholds are not defense
conservative, it has at least brought industry attention to
GMD. This standard, even if rigorously enforced, will leave the
grid dangerously vulnerable to GMD and needs to be revised.
Without a corresponding FERC EMP directive, the private
sector is not doing much of anything on the EMP front.
New legislation is needed to empower FERC, specifically to
be able to write and enforce grid protection standards and,
second, to identify mechanisms, including cost recovery
measures to incentivize the private sector.
A national EMP protection standard is needed. DHS is to be
commended for issuing a coordination version of a protection
standard, but that needs to become official and expanded to
address not just communication centers, but the electric grid
itself.
For more than half a century, the Department of Defense
(DOD) has protected high-priority military command-and-control
communication computer assets for nuclear deterrence. DHS and
DOE programs need to emulate what DOD is doing, their methods.
We need to preclude the temptation to reinvent the wheel by
giving DHS and DOE full access to the DOD standards and
databases. There is no need to recalculate a standard EMP
waveform.
Chairman Johnson. Listen, I understand that this is not
easy to do, OK? I apologize for that, but I really wanted to
get into the discussion phase as quickly as possible.
Mr. Baker. OK.
Chairman Johnson. What I will say about Dr. Baker's
testimony is that I did call him. Was it yesterday or 2 days
ago? Because reading through his testimony, I saw what I have
not seen in about 6 years of doing this--actual action items.
I asked him to prioritize that. He was going through that
list. I would kind of like to use that list. You have all got
the testimony, correct? OK. Do you have that priority list of
Dr. Baker?
I would suggest as we continue this discussion--again, we
will go through all the opening statements, but when we turn to
questions, I would recommend to the Senators and I would also
recommend to the panelists to take a look at that priority list
because it is actual action items, the things that we should be
doing from a top-down approach, what the Federal Government has
to do, versus a bottom-up approach, local utilities, local
governments, that type of thing.
Again, I thought it was just very well organized, and I
think it is a good way for us to organize our discussion,
around basically the action items that Dr. Baker put in his
testimony.
Again, I apologize for cutting you off, but we will get to
these lists and I think in good detail.
What I want to ferret out from this is, What do we agree
on? Where is there a dispute? What maybe does not industry
agree with versus what does government agree on? I want to get
this out, fleshed out, so we can actually move forward with
some real action items.
Having said that, our next participant is Scott Aaronson.
He is Vice President for Security and Preparedness at Edison
Electric Institute (EEI). Mr. Aaronson.
TESTIMONY OF SCOTT AARONSON,\1\ VICE PRESIDENT FOR SECURITY AND
PREPAREDNESS, EDISON ELECTRIC INSTITUTE
Mr. Aaronson. Thank you, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member
Peters, and Members of the Committee. As you said, my name is
Scott Aaronson, Vice President for Security and Preparedness at
EEI.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Aaronson appears in the Appendix
on page 85.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EEI represents all of the Nation's investor-owned electric
companies, and members operate in all 50 States and the
District of Columbia and serve more than 70 percent of all
electricity customers in the United States.
EEI appreciates your leadership in convening this
roundtable, and I look forward to discussing the electric power
industry's work to protect against both electromagnetic pulses
and geomagnetic disturbances.
My written testimony goes into further detail about
industry's efforts to address threats posed by EMPs, but for
the purpose of open comments, I want to address three important
themes.
First, we take all threats to our infrastructure seriously.
Whether preparing for natural hazards or malicious acts, EEI's
members are committed to protecting the communities they
served. Ensuring we provide a reliable product is our business.
So we have every incentive to protect our systems.
Second, when it comes to issues of national security, the
electric power industry recognizes its role in protecting the
lives and safety of our customers. We also recognize that with
intelligent adversaries and an evolving threat landscape,
partnering with Federal, State, and local government is
paramount.
In fact, the President's National Infrastructure Advisory
Council (NIAC), called the Electricity Subsector Coordinating
Council and the electric sector the ``model for government-
industry coordination.'' While we are exceedingly proud of that
designation and working with our partners at DOE and DHS, we
are also striving to improve the industry's preparedness
against all hazards by leveraging both industry and government
capabilities.
Finally, we agree that both EMP and GMD post threats to the
reliability operation of the energy grid and therefore to the
economic and national security of the Nation.
To the extent that policy changes are necessary, we look
forward to working with all the committees of jurisdiction and
our partners at DOE, DHS, DOD, FERC, and throughout the Federal
Government.
But sound policy must be based on sound science, and it is
for that reason that we appreciate the work of the Electric
Power Research Institute (EPRI) and the North American Electric
Reliability Corporation, which informs industry as we pursue
the right investments and operating posture to appropriately
protect the energy grid.
Thank you again for this opportunity. I look forward to the
discussion.
Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Aaronson.
We will now turn to Randy Horton. He is the Senior Program
Manager for Grid Operations and Planning at the Electric Power
Research Industries. Mr. Horton.
TESTIMONY OF RANDY HORTON, PH.D.,\1\ SENIOR PROGRAM MANAGER,
GRID OPERATIONS AND PLANNING, ELECTRIC POWER RESEARCH INSTITUTE
Mr. Horton. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Peters, and
Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to
participate in today's hearing. My name is Randy Horton, and I
am a senior program manager at the Electric Power Research
Institute.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Horton appears in the Appendix on
page 96.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
EPRI takes electromagnetic threats seriously and has
conducted extensive research to improve understanding of the
potential impacts that high-altitude EMP and GMD events can
have on the electric grid.
As an example, EPRI launched a focus research effort in
April 2016 to evaluate the potential impacts of a high-altitude
EMP attack on the U.S. electric grid and to identify and test
options for mitigating those potential impacts.
Currently, there are more than 60 U.S. utilities
participating in this research project. Using various
unclassified or bounding high-altitude EMP environments,
including those provided by DOE and Los Alamos, we have
evaluated the potential impacts of high-altitude EMP on the
electric transition system.
Additionally, we have evaluated and tested several options
for mitigating impacts that were identified.
A final report of this research, including assessment
results and mitigation options, is expected to be made
available on April 30th of this year.
A key to our success has been our close collaboration with
subject-matter experts at the DOE, the three DOE weapons labs,
and the Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA). The sharing of
knowledge and information that has occurred over a 3-year
period has been very valuable to our research and also to the
industry.
GMD is also concerned for the bulk power system, and over
the last four decades, EPRI has been a leader in this area. We
are currently performing research to improve industry's ability
to predict and mitigate the potential impacts of a severe GMD
event, and the results of this research may be used to inform
future revisions of NERC GMD standards.
In closing, EPRI is committed to developing science-based
solutions to these complex problems and will continue to offer
technical leadership and support to the electricity sector,
public, policymakers, and other stakeholders.
Thank you for your time. That concludes my testimony.
Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Horton.
Our next participant is David Roop. He is the Director for
Electric Transmission Operations and Reliability at Dominion
Energy. Mr. Roop.
TESTIMONY OF DAVID ROOP,\1\ DIRECTOR, ELECTRIC TRANSMISSION
OPERATIONS AND RELIABILITY, DOMINION ENERGY
Mr. Roop. Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member
Peters, and Members of the Committee.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Roop appears in the Appendix on
page 108.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
I am the director of Electric Transmission Operations and
Reliability at Dominion Energy. My company very much
appreciates the opportunity to participate in today's hearing.
Dominion Energy is headquartered in Richmond, Virginia, and
provides electricity or natural gas to 7.5 million homes and
businesses across 18 States. The service area for our regulated
utility, Dominion Energy Virginia, is in close proximity to the
District of Columbia, and it includes many vital national
security and defense operations.
We also provide electricity to a large percentage of the
Internet traffic in the world.
During my 43 years with Dominion Energy, my focus has been
on electric transmission and substation operations. At Dominion
Energy, we consider all hazards, manmade or acts of man as well
as naturally occurring events, in both our planning and
operations. Protecting our system for GMD and EMP is part of
that mission.
Over many decades, we have hardened our substation
components to better enable them to survive the impact of GMD
events. This hardening has occurred as we upgrade or replace
equipment at the end of a life.
Over the course of many years, Dominion Energy has made
investments and developed contingency plans to improve the
resiliency of our network that may confront it with EMP events.
Making these simple changes has also improved our day-to-
day operations for challenges such as lightning and transients.
But we now come to a point that requires additional
research to guide our future efforts to improve system
resiliency for EMP events. This research is extremely important
in helping us to make prudent investments. The tremendous
support of our Federal partners has allowed us to get to the
point we are today. This assistance has really improved our
knowledge, and we are grateful for it. I ask the U.S.
Government to continue this effort to get us across these next
few research areas.
Thank you for the opportunity to be here today.
Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Roop.
Our next participant is James Vespalec.
Mr. Vespalec is the Director for Asset Planning and
Engineering at the American Transmission Company (ATC)
headquartered in Waukesha, Wisconsin. Mr. Vespalec.
TESTIMONY OF JAMES VESPALEC,\1\ DIRECTOR, ASSET PLANNING AND
ENGINEERING, AMERICAN TRANSMISSION COMPANY
Mr. Vespalec. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Johnson,
Ranking Member Peters, and Members of the Committee.

I am with American Transmission Company as was mentioned.
We were formed in January 2001 as a transmission-only utility.
We operate 9,600 miles of transmission lines and assets in
about 560 substations in portions of Wisconsin, Michigan,
Minnesota, and Illinois. We do not own generation, and we do
not have load-serving customers. We serve other utilities that
serve the load.
We have been active in many different industry
organizations, such as EPRI and North American Transmission
Forum (NATF) and others, where we monitor the research and
follow the steps that are being taken in the industry, trying
to identify prudent steps that we can take to mitigate these
risks.
I think one of the reasons I am here, in 2015, ATC
purchased the first commercially available transformer neutral-
insertion device and installed in one of our substations. We
found a substation that was ideal for that device, and we
installed that prototype, which is meant to automatically
protect the transformer from harmful geomagnetic-induced
currents. To my knowledge, it is the only one currently
installed and operational in the industry.
We set the threshold on it very low so that we could get a
lot of operations on it and get some experience with it. So
far, it has operated dozens of times and has performed as
designed.
It is not meant to be done without forethought to just put
one in. You need to do a little bit of thinking and studying of
the transmission network so you can fully understand what the
impacts might be.
We take many other steps, defense-in-depth approach, as
highlighted in my statement, sharing information like we are
doing today, and some of the research that is going on at EPRI
are critical for tackling this issue and finding prudent
effective decisions to make.
Chairman Johnson. Thank you.
Our next participant is Justin Kasper. Mr. Kasper is an
Associate Professor of Space, Science, and Engineering at the
University of Michigan. Mr. Kasper.
TESTIMONY OF JUSTIN KASPER, PH.D.,\2\ ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF
SPACE, SCIENCE, AND ENGINEERING, UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN
Mr. Kasper. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Peters,
Members of the Committee. Thank you for this opportunity to
discuss with you what we know about the solar origin of
geomagnetic disturbances and how we can improve our ability to
predict their occurrence.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ The prepared statement of Mr. Kasper appears in the Appendix on
page 119.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The famous Carrington event of 1859 started with a visible
flare on the Sun, and then 18 hours later, a magnetic tsunami
engulfed Earth, sending compasses spinning, bringing the
Northern Lights down to the Caribbean, making telegraph lines
spark. We might not rely on a telegraph today, but our power
lines are equally susceptible.
The risk from these events is real, and unfortunately, the
Carrington event was not some unique event. On July 23, 2012,
for instance, a spacecraft operating on the other side of the
Sun was immersed in a similar eruption that would have hit
Earth square on if it had happened just 9 days sooner.
Multiple researchers estimate the probability of a similar
event happening in any one decade at between 3 and 10 percent.
Now, I would also like to stress in addition to these
extreme events, smaller but more frequent GMD also have a
significant cumulative impact. For example, commercial
insurance claims for damage to electronics spike around 20
percent during periods of heightened geomagnetic activity. This
translates to an average of $10 billion in damage each year in
the United States so if we could address those major GMDs, we
might also be able to protect ourself from those smaller
events.
What can we do about this? Well, right now, telescopies
detect an eruption at the Sun, and we make a forecast. We do
not have any confirmation until it reaches the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Deep Space Climate
Observatory (DSCOVR) spacecraft. Now, any earning is better
than none, but an extreme event would get from that spacecraft
to Earth in less than 10 minutes, and this is not enough time
to assess the risk and recommended action.
We need spacecraft closer to the Sun, providing earlier
warning of Earth-directed events and their properties that are
models of those eruptions and regional forecasts of GMDs. Most
importantly, I think we need leadership with the authority to
coordinate and direct the research and operational components
of space weather that are spread now over multiple agencies.
Chairman Johnson. Thank you, Mr. Kasper.
Our final participant is Caitlin Durkovich. Ms. Durkovich
is currently a Director at Toffler Associates and previously
served as Assistant Secretary of Infrastructure Protection at
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Ms. Durkovich.
STATEMENT OF CAITLIN DURKOVICH,\1\ DIRECTOR, TOFFLER ASSOCIATES
Ms. Durkovich. Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, Ranking
Member Peters, and Members of the Committee. Thank you for
inviting me to testify today on protecting the electric grid
from an EMP or GMD, and thank you for your leadership on this
issue.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Durkovich appears in the Appendix
on page 124.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition to having served as the Assistant Secretary for
Infrastructure Protection, I also co-chaired the Space Weather
Operations Research and Mitigation (SWORM), Task Force, which
produced ``The National Space Weather Strategy'' and action
plan in 2016.
There is no doubt the risk facing our critical
infrastructure has grown. We are reliant on aging
infrastructures that increasingly leverage data and technology
to enable more efficient, reliable, and distributed operations.
This highly interconnected, electrified, and digitized
ecosystem is not only being used for purposes we never could
have imagined when it was built a century ago, but it must be
resilient to risks, as Senator Peters said, that we never could
have imagined or fully appreciated 100 years ago.
What is encouraging is the partnership and coordination
between government and industry, which owns most of our
Nation's critical infrastructure. It has matured, and it is
providing more visibility into emergent threat vectors and
potential consequences guiding join action on risk mitigation.
The Electricity Subsector Coordinating Council (ESCC) is
one such example. The SWORM Task Force is another. DHS's
strategy for protecting and preparing the homeland against
threats of EMP and GMD is another. The strategy's three goals
are practical steps, the critical infrastructure community can
coalesce around.
I do agree with DHS's assessment about the potential
severity of both the direct and indirect impacts of an EMP or
GMD incident and that it should compel our national attention.
One of the biggest challenges I believe we face is risk
awareness and sustained focus on this hard problem. Lower
probability, high-consequence threats are overshadowed by real-
time threats that require 24/7 attention, such as cyberattacks.
I believe that we can take a page from hurricane
preparedness to help improve action around this important
issue, and I look forward to talking to you about it over the
course of the next several hours.
Thank you very much, and I think we can get to the heart of
the matter now.
Chairman Johnson. Let us get to it.
Normally, what ends up happening in these Senate types of
hearings is we go down a list, and we each get 5 minutes to 7
minutes. That works fine, but we end up with a pretty
disjointed conversation from my standpoint.
So what I want is a little bit more of a free-for-all. I
expect Senators to be respectful of each other. We will chime
in, but what I would like, because there is so many of you, if
you want to chime in on a particular topic or question, just
put your name tag up like that, and we will try and get to you
sort of in the order that you have done that.
I would just quick-start out the line of questioning,
getting back to what I was saying in my opening statement.
Do not take offense by this. I heard a number of you talk
about we take this very seriously. OK, good. We have to. What
have we done about it? We have known about this since--well,
GMD, Carrington effect, in terms of high-altitude nuclear
blasts since the early 1960s.
By the way, when I was interviewing General Kelly for
Secretary of Homeland Security, I asked him about his
understanding of the threat of EMP and does he take it
seriously because we have had people on this Committee say it
is hokum. I asked General Kelly. I said, ``What is your
evaluation of this? Is this going to be a top priority of you
as a Secretary?'' He said, ``Well, Senator, I am not a
technologist, but I do know in the Defense Department, we spent
billions of dollars hardening our defense assets.''
In part of Dr. Baker's testimony, it is that we have the
military spec for this. We have known about this. We are not
doing high-altitude nuclear tests. We do not have the specific
information on current electronics, but we have standards now.
I want to start out with Mr. McClelland with FERC. FERC did
establish a spec for GMD. Why did we not establish a spec for
EMP?
According to Dr. Baker's testimony--I do not want to throw
you under the bus, Dr. Baker, but the GMD spec is set at too
low intensity, and we are assuming the survivability of these
transformers and equipment is just too high.
Can you explain what happened with FERC? Because that is
certainly one of the recommendations of Dr. Baker is we have to
establish a higher standard for GMD and we have to establish
standards for EMP or the industry will not do anything. I do
not blame them because they have no direction.
But, please.
Mr. McClelland. To that point, we have been discussing this
and been before panels multiple times, and we have said in the
open--I know I have said it under testimony--that the NERC
standards development process is a consensus-based process with
industry. FERC cannot write or author the standards. It can
conduct research, and it has done that.
So, in 2010, it, with DOE and DHS, sponsored extensive
studies on GMD, EMP, and Intentional Electromagnetic
Interference (IEMI) as a basis for further action. It then sua
sponte or on its own motion directed NERC to develop a GMD
standard. That was after there was significant contentious
discussions between subject-matter experts and industry, and
the argument went like this. If the grid collapses--first of
all, FERC came out with a study with the Oak Ridge National Lab
(ORNL), with DHS and DOE, and said that up to 368 bulk power
system transformers would be damaged--could be damaged or
destroyed after a significant GMD event.
There was a counter-study then performed by EPRI and DOE
that asserted that the grid would collapse before that damage
occurred. That is a great point.
We established in either case, it does not matter.
Wholesale collapse of the power grid for days or a week or more
would cost so much money and so much suffering that the
standard was justified.
So FERC on its own motion ordered the standard to be
developed. It gave guidelines to NERC. NERC developed the
consensus process. FERC than approves it because it establishes
a baseline. At least there is a baseline.
But when it approved these standards, subsequent standards
from NERC, there were iterations. Three separate times when
FERC approved the standard, it directed modifications to that
standard, and that really goes back to the crux of the
standards themselves.
What we have said openly is that for national security
purposes--and this is part of the oral remarks and the written
testimony--the standards development process is too slow. It
takes years to develop a standard. It is too open. Our
adversaries can read the standards and design around them as
quickly as the standards are put into place, and it is not
necessarily responsive to the Commission's directive.
The standard that we have is a result of industry
consensus, and at least it is a basis. That is why FERC uses a
dualfold approach and works with--I have known Dr. Baker for
years, and we worked together on this issue. We use best
practices collaborating with the Department of Energy,
Department of Homeland Security, the intel community, and we do
classified briefings with industry members to say, ``You do not
have to put this everywhere.''
But for those most critical points--and if you remember our
last hearing, we modeled those critical points and said here
are the most critical points on the system where if you use
best practices, it may be enough to dissuade adversarial
action.
Chairman Johnson. OK. Somebody answer the question. You
guys be willing to jump in here.
We already had specifications to harden our military
assets. I believe in the ``Keep it simple, stupid'' (KISS)
principle: Keep it simple. Why would we not just go to that?
Those things have been available for how long, Dr. Baker?
How long have we been hardening our military assets against EMP
and GMD?
Dr. Baker; We started in the 1960s with the Minuteman
System. Our first EMP protection standard came out in 1992, I
believe.
Chairman Johnson. We have had a standard that required no
further research whatsoever to start hardening critical assets.
One of the parts of your testimony--and this is one of the
reasons I have a fire under my you-know-what on this is we are
now creating these microgrids that, according to your
testimony, Dr. Baker, would cost 2 to 5 percent more to hit the
military standard----
Mr. Baker. Yes. And the GMD.
Chairman Johnson [continuing]. For protection?
Mr. Baker. Right.
Chairman Johnson. But unless we have a top-down standard
set by FERC and NERC or the Department of Energy, Department of
Homeland Security, it will not happen, correct? I mean, you
could ask industry about this.
Again, why would we not do that? Is there any reason not to
do that? Is there any reason why Senator Murkowski's staff and
her Energy Committee should not hop on this right away and pass
a law that says this will be the standard? Particularly for
microgrids because that is right now sort of the urgent
problem.
Mr. Baker. This is a watershed moment for microgrids. Yes.
Chairman Johnson. Go ahead, Mr. Horton.
Mr. Horton. I know you are aware that our final report is
not out, so I cannot go into a whole lot of detail, but your
question is basically the initial question that we were
answering as a part of our research is the mil standards--and
to be specific, it would be the unclassified mil standards.
Those exist. Could you go apply them to a utility?
One of the first things we did as a part of our research
was, without knowing anything else, if you took the unclass.
military standards and applied them to a substation, for
example, in an electric grid, what would that look like?
Through that process--and keep in mind that those standards--
and I am speaking to the military standards--were never
designed to hardened utility-type assets.
As we got into the details a little bit, a lot of it, you
could use, but there were some things that if you were to use
them, you could actually create potential issues.
I guess the basic answer to your question is when you take
those standards and begin to apply them to utilities, the devil
is in the details. So working out some of that is a research
need, which we have done as a part of this research project.
Chairman Johnson. We have been doing this for--let us just
go back, instead of the 1960s, to 2001, the first EMP
Commission. So this is 18 years. The question I would ask what
have--we have taken this seriously. What have we actually done
other than literally admire the problem?
Mr. Horton. As a part of our research, we have identified--
I would prefer not to go into that today, but we have
identified actions that utilities can do to harden against E1
EMP, for example, using nonmilitary----
Chairman Johnson. Issuing your report when?
Mr. Horton. April 30th of this year, 2 months from now
basically.
Chairman Johnson. OK. Good. Look forward to seeing it.
Senator Peters. I do not want to get off track here, but I
want to get back to the GMDs and the discussion.
Mr. McClelland, you mentioned that the standards are put in
place for the industry now. My understanding, though, is that
the standards are--assuming it is a Carrington-type event that
we have talked about, it is a thousand-year event. Is that
accurate? You are not really planning for that? That,
basically, that type of event would overwhelm the grid?
Mr. McClelland. I do not know the specific tie-back to
Carrington, but I can say that it does not consider a
Carrington-type event. No, the standards would not do that.
Senator Peters. Right. If we had a Carrington-type event,
we would be in serious trouble because the standards do not do
that.
Dr. Kasper, I think the industry thinks, or at least based
on these standards, that this is like a thousand-year event.
You mentioned in your testimony every decade, it could be up to
a 10 percent chance. We missed one just a few years ago by 9
days. What does the science tell you?
Mr. Kasper. Well, I reviewed the standard, and I see the
argument. It is largely based off of events like an event in
1989, which is well studied. One of the problems with the
Carrington event is we did not have spacecraft back then, so we
do not have enough data.
If you had asked me and my community 10 years ago, we would
say maybe this is a one-in-a-thousand-year event, but since
then, we have had more events.
In 2012, one of our spacecraft called Solar Terrestrial
Relations Observatory (STEREO) intercepted a larger than
Carrington, actually, we think, event heading away from the
Sun, and it actually took a year or two to realize just how
substantial that event was and really process it.
But we were clearly seeing it happening on a repeating
basis. We know that they are happening, and we have spacecraft
observations that tell us how strong the magnetic field is.
It would be wonderful to be able to model what that event
would have done to Earth and use that as a basis for probably a
more common large-scale event.
Chairman Johnson. Is there any scale we can compare? If
that was a 10, what is the FERC specification? Are we hardened
to a 3? Are we hardened to a 9? How far behind are we? Dr.
Baker?
Mr. Baker. There was a FERC Oak Ridge National Lab study
that was based on a 1921--it is called the ``Railroad Storm,''
which in the Earth magnetic field disturbance terms was a
5,000-nanotesla-per-minute storm.
The 1989 event, which is pretty close to what we have in
the GMD standard, was a 500-nanotesla-per-minute storm.
Senator Peters. Wow.
Mr. Baker [continuing]. Nanotesla-per-minute, one-tenth of
a 1921 storm, which was 100 years ago.
Chairman Johnson. The standard is set really low. Anybody
want to dispute that? The GMD standard right now by FERC to
NERC to industry is really low.
Mr. Baker. It is not defense conservative.
Chairman Johnson. It would be nice to try and get it down
to those types of terms so we can kind of describe this to
people, but that is what we are trying to look for.
Senator Peters. Does anybody dispute that, that they are
very low?
Mr. Horton. I would add maybe a technical detail. The March
1989 event--so we are talking nanoteslas. Another way to look
at this is electric field levels. It is on the order of 2 volts
per kilometer, and the benchmark TPL-7, 1-in-100-year event for
the same geomagnetic latitude is 8 volts per kilometer. It is
actually about four times higher than the 1989 event.
Now, that compared to the 1921 event, I do not know the
details of that.
Mr. Baker. The 1921 event, if you believe Faraday's Law,
would be 20 volts per kilometer.
Chairman Johnson. The length of transmission line, it just
keeps growing too, right? It is not necessarily the intensity
of just the burst. It is how long a transmission line you have
that it just accumulates, correct? Or am I misinterpreting
that?
By the way, just hop in. Just start talking.
OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROSEN
Senator Rosen. OK. Well, I know I am new to the Committee,
so I have a couple of questions about the resiliency and the
redundancy of our grid. Of course, we have multiple grids, our
military grid, our commercial grid, what I like to call our
``distributed grid.'' It will have solar, wind farms, geo,
thermal, water power, and of course, cyber communications now,
wireless communications, all part of the interconnectivity of
this grid.
Can you tell me how these bursts are impacting the wireless
communication between these distributed grids? And then the
second part, what is the resiliency and redundancy that is
built in? We know everything is connected. If one cyberattack,
maybe they can just hit us from a satellite down to a grid, and
it goes out. What is the resiliency and redundancy you have
built in for that, please?
Mr. Aaronson. I will start, but I am going to rely heavily
on a couple of the engineers who are sitting to my left.
You raise a really important point about interconnectivity,
not just of the grid itself, but to other critical sectors.
Senator Rosen. Not so much transmission lines as wireless--
--
Mr. Aaronson. It is the actual communication.
Senator Rosen [continuing]. Communication between our
satellites as they circle around the Earth now.
Mr. Aaronson. That is exactly right.
So for us to be able to operate, I think one of the things
that I want to kind of challenge is that the electric sector
would not do anything but for standards.
I think that may be true 15 or 20 years ago. That might be
older history, but I think given the shift in geopolitical
threats to our Nation and our sector of being particularly key
to our national sector, this is why this sector came together
at the Chief Executive Office (CEO) level to start really
focusing on some of the threats that we are facing.
We are proud of the progress that we have made. I would
kind of push back on we would not do anything. There are good
examples of things that we are doing to protect our systems,
but what you have to recognize is we could harden everything to
mil spec.
Senator Rosen. That is right.
Mr. Aaronson. It would probably cost an awful lot of money
to provide electricity to our customers, but if we do not have
water, we cannot generate steam or cool systems. If we do not
have telecommunications, we cannot operate. If we do not have
transportation and pipelines, we cannot move fuel.
So looking at this, to use Dr. Baker's language of a top-
down, holistic, sort of defense minimum, we do have to be
thinking about this in terms of a lot of cross-sector impact.
That said, we also have to be doing this from a risk-based
approach. One of the things that is most important--and again,
I think the military did it similarly, which is you prioritize.
We were not putting mil spec, EMP hardening on the Post
Exchange (PX), but we were on command-and-control assets.
So what are those key assets in the North American electric
grid that we ought to be hardening to a particular level?
Senator Rosen. What is connected to it outside? You can
harden this building, but there are so many connections into
this, not necessarily hard transmission lines.
Mr. Aaronson. The one thing I would respond to you on that
is one of the defenses that we have as a sector is the
biodiversity. If you have seen one control center, you have
seen one control center. If you have seen one sort of company's
structure and we will call them their substation settings--you
have seen one.
From a cyber perspective in particular, that gives us an
awful lot of resilience because an adversary can attack one
company and they have attacked one company. Because of the
resilience, the redundancy, the biodiversity in the grid, we do
have excess capacity, spending reserves, the ability to move
electricity in different ways.
Now, one of the things that I am passionate about is from
an engineering perspective--I have talked to engineers before
who have said, ``Oh, we would just reengineer the system,'' if
blank happened. Do we know what that looks like? Have we done
that before? Can we test it? Can we prove it?
Senator Rosen. Right.
Mr. Aaronson. This goes sound science needs sound--or sound
science results in sound policy.
These studies, while we call it admiring the problem, it is
not admiring the problem. It is making sure we are doing the
right things so that we can have more resilience and do it in a
cost-effective way.
Senator Rosen. Now with quantum computing, with all kinds
of things, what do you feel that you can do with predictive
modeling so you can simulate these things and you can actually
run some disaster recovery plans, all on a computer? Right?
Mr. Aaronson. There is terrific modeling, and I am going to
look over at Karen Evans for that.
Senator Rosen. What can we do to help you improve that
modeling, thus, improving not only the predictability, but also
bringing us back up in case of an event?
Ms. Evans. OK. There was a lot in your question. No, which
is----
Senator Rosen. Sorry. It is an exciting topic.
Ms. Evans. No. Which is awesome because to get to your
point about the discussion and what our agency is doing and how
we are approaching this, this situation from a whole-of-
government approach.
But to the modelings and what we do at the National Labs
and so what we are doing within Department of Energy, which was
required through the Fixing America's Surface Transportation
(FAST) Act of 2015, that other components within DOE, we are
looking at.
We are currently building a model right now. We call it the
North American Resiliency Model (NARM), which Assistant
Secretary Walker has talked about. And that is what he is
building.
It is to model exactly what you are talking about, but the
requirements under the FAST Act that Senator Murkowski and that
Committee's leadership has said was you have to identify what
are the critical assets across in the energy sector and then
what are the interdependencies.
In the defense critical energy infrastructure base as well,
it is what are those energy resources that are critical to the
Department of Energy. Then they can do certain things within
the DOD parameter. Then what is outside that parameter, which
is in the energy sector? How do we rely on private sector with
that? Collect the data. The critical points that Mr. McClelland
is talking about is in this model.
So we anticipate, as DOE, that this first modeling will be
done by the fall.
Then, to your point, there is capabilities in the National
Labs under quantum computing, under the data, what we are doing
in the CESER program, and the work that we are doing with--tri-
sector with DHS is you put the data on top of that so that you
can actually start doing the modeling and what is the impact of
that and integrate that in under these scenarios and test
scenarios.
So that, to your point about should we put this standard in
place, there is a cost associated with all of these, right? And
most of this infrastructure is owned by private industry.
As we go forward, what we are going to have to do is
provide enough information with good science that informs the
investment. Does it make sense on this list from a top-down
approach? How much does the Federal Government do in order to
protect? What is the risk associated with these types of
events? What does industry match us as what is that risk and
what is going to happen so that we can do the modeling?
Chairman Johnson. I remember a hearing a couple of years
ago where we had GAO. They had issued a report on the results
of the EMP Commission, and they had, I think, an A through O
list about quick fixes, things we have to do. The testimony
after years of those recommendations being out there, we had
done none of them. These were tasked to the Department of
Energy and to DHS. And they had done nothing.
Again, I keep coming back to the point, prioritization.
Listen, I would like to operate with perfect information. If
you make a one-dollar investment, that is a solid dollar
investment. It is not wasted at all.
I do not blame industry. You are not going to act until
government forces you to act. I blame government for being very
slow off the mark.
We finally, after a couple of years, got Critical
Infrastructure Protection Act (CIPA) passed, which basically
the argument was is it a strategy or plan? Well, we called for
a report from DHS. We got it a year late. It is 23 pages of
basically a strategy to develop a strategy to develop a plan.
There are no action items.
I go back to the EMP Commission, some quick fixes. We have
talked about, OK, we do not have perfect science, but we do
know if we start blowing large power transformers, we cannot
replace them. The redundancy in terms of sharing with other
utilities, well, if you are all wiped out, that does not work
very well. If we are completely down, how do you black-start
the entire grid?
Again, I am looking for prioritization of action to
actually do something to start mitigating this as opposed to we
are going to wait for the model. We will inform our study,
which we will start maybe developing a plan. Then there will be
a new Administration. Then we will have another law passed, and
we will have to do a study on that. Are you sensing some
frustration from at least the Chair?
Ms. Evans. Sir?
Chairman Johnson. OK. Ms. Evans. Sure.
Ms. Evans. OK. Yes, sir. I sense your frustration, and the
model is not the only activity that is being done jointly
within the community.
When you look at the list and you look at the action items,
again, I believe Secretary Perry and what this Administration
has done is take the frustration of what you are saying and
what is the responsibilities and what is expected of Congress
back to the Department of Energy.
That is exactly why my office was formed. It is not just
cybersecurity, but it is energy security and then the response.
So to some of this stuff that you are talking about as it
relates to response, we hold joint exercises. The exercises are
critical. The exercises are tangible. They are scheduled, and
they are scenario-based. The point of that is to test out. You
have a plan in place. The time that the incident occurs is not
the time for us to be testing the plan. The exercises are set
up for us to actually test do we have the right things in place
and where are the gaps in our research, so that we can then
redirect the research.
I did bring specific activities of the research that we are
doing in the Department, how much we have applied to that, and
how we are moving forward with our National Labs to be able to
do the modeling, to do the predictive pieces.
Chairman Johnson. You are confusing activity with action to
actually mitigate, OK?
Ms. Evans. No. No, no, no, no.
If you have an exercise and you see where you do not have
the strategy--for example, we did it jointly with DOD, the
Liberty Eclipse exercise up in Plum Island. That is a black
start. If you do not have the equipment prepositioned, which is
things that we have learned from the hurricane responses of
doing mutual assistance, then you can start looking at how do
you redo some of those things, how do you reach out, and what
are the interdependencies, and then how do we have to then
either come to Congress and say we have gaps in our authorities
or we have to go out to industry and our industry partners and
say we have to adjust the mutual assistance agreements that we
have out there or this is how some of these things--or
eventually, to your point, we have enough information that we
then go to FERC and NERC and say we need to establish a
standard.
Senator Rosen. But how can we help you here in Congress to
bridge these gaps? I have worked on disaster recovery plans and
computer systems. That is how you learn. That is how you find
out the holes. You go back and you keep practicing. Of course,
it is like practicing for the big game, right?
And so you have private industry. They are not going to do
anything maybe unless we make them. Maybe not. They do have
assets to protect.
But what do you need from us, I think, specifically to try
to help from this maybe triad or multiple partnerships, so we
are working on a goal with action items that is tangible? Not
saying, ``We did our test. We show the hole. Will you? Can you?
Maybe?'' What can we do here, legislatively, to support you and
the mission that you have reaching out to your different
communities?
Chairman Johnson. Can we start with Mr. Roop? We will work
our way down here.
Senator Peters. Get everybody, yes.
Mr. Roop. I wanted to get back to your point: Is the
industry doing anything?
As I indicated in my written testimony, we have replaced
all of our capacitor banks and all of our major power
transformers with ones that are hardened to handle, the GMD and
the E3 event.
We have also gone beyond the NERC planning standards to
understand severe stress levels on our system and put
monitoring equipment on so we know what actions to take to
separate the system and take stuff out of service before it
could fail. Those are actions we have done because we know we
have to protect our grid. That is part of our business.
The issue we have is we have to use mil specs where it
makes sense. We just built a new operating center. It is a full
mil-spec operating center. Everything is protected in it, but
the problem with that, I cannot do it in the substations
because of the consequences it has on the protection equipment
I have that protects our system every day. I do not want to do
something that will cause daily harm to our system.
The next study and hopefully in the next 12 months with the
EPRI work with the Federal partners, we can figure out how to
protect reasonably that kind of equipment so that we can now
implement that solution.
We also need EMP communications, and we are trying to get
that stood up and do that by October of this year through the
Electric Sector Coordinating Council (SCC).
This industry is working very hard at it, but we just
cannot assume something and throw it out there because I do not
want to collapse a grid in the process. That is the issue we
have got.
Chairman Johnson. I understand.
Mr. Roop. That is what we are trying to get through right
now.
Chairman Johnson. I understand that. I realize Dominion is
forward-leaning on this, but to what GMD spec did you harden
your----
Mr. Roop. Well, we have gone beyond the spec, and we have
stressed our system.
I will be honest with you. We are trying to push the
bounds, and we are working with National Aeronautics and Space
Administration (NASA), U.S. Geological Survey, NOAA, and EPRI.
We are trying to understand what are the limits of the network,
and we are not the only ones. We are working with other
utilities across the United States to understand, and they are
also doing the same exercise we are doing because we are trying
to understand really where is the issue.
But we have also got a sparing plan where if everything
goes out, I can get my system back up with the spares I have,
and we have done that proactively because they are out of
service. They are not going to be impacted by a solar storm.
They are not going to be impacted by electromagnetic----
Chairman Johnson. You already have the large power
transformers?
Mr. Roop. Yes, sir. We have already done it, and we have
done it based on the work with DOE on a minimum grid model. We
did that as part of the FAST Act work with them, and that has
really helped us kind of understand where your stress levels
are.
This work they are doing now is extremely important to give
to the rest of the industry.
Senator Peters. If I could just follow up there. That you
have higher standards, you have gone further. You have made
additional investments into your grid. I think it is partly
because of a lot of the sensitive assets here in the D.C. area
that will need that kind of protection from disturbance.
You are assuming--and I think all of you are assuming--that
you are taking on the storm, the GMD event, that your systems
are taking on the storm. You have not changed anything.
What would it be if we had better forecasting, that we
actually know the storm is coming? Would anything change in
terms of your preparedness?
Right now, that detection, my understanding is we can
detect GMD events like we could hurricanes in the 1930s. So
that is not all that great, but if we made those kinds of
investments, how would you react?
Mr. Roop. That would be excellent, and I will be honest
with you. That is why we are working so close with NASA.
We think right now, the way we do the studies, we assume
the field is moving all the time, and at different
orientations, they are going to strike transmission lines. In
reality, that is probably not what is going to happen, but we
do not know how it is going to affect us. So you make the worst
case guess, if you can.
So, forewarning and better computer models that we are
getting and with what NASA and others are working on, it would
very much help us.
Senator Peters. How much time would you need?
Mr. Roop. If we had 24-to-48-hour notice, it would be
wonderful.
Chairman Johnson. We had testimony with that kind of
notice, and we can shut down the grid. The question I asked,
OK, who is going to make that call? There was, of course, no
answer.
Mr. Baker. Secretary of Energy. [Laughter.]
Mr. Aaronson. There is an answer now because of the FAST
Act, and security emergency authority now resides at the
Department of Energy.
Chairman Johnson. So who would make the call?
Senator Peters. Who would make the call?
Ms. Evans. The Secretary would make a recommendation to the
President saying that we are in a grid emergency, and then the
President would then make the call. It would be based on
information that we are jointly working with, with the
industry.
But the FAST Act put that in place, and one of the things
that I am working on right now is what is that level of
gradation that goes up, that constitutes this is a grid
emergency, so therefore the Secretary needs to make that
recommendation.
Senator Peters. How much time do you need?
Ms. Evans. How much time do we need to declare?
Senator Peters. To go through that process.
Ms. Evans. I am accelerating everything we are doing. We
are testing several data collection things now that we should
be with the National Labs, have an operational capability, to
see if we can do it by April, of having the data that then can
get into the hands of everybody looking at it to be able to
then say, OK, at this circumstances, it constitutes this. We
would work jointly with our whole-of-government approach and
with the National Security Council to make that determination.
Senator Peters. But if NOAA gave you a warning that a major
space weather event is heading here now, how much time do you
need to go through that process?
Because I think, Dr. Kasper, you said sometimes it is 10
minutes warning. That is not going to happen, really.
Mr. Kasper. Right now, with our spacecraft at L1 with
NOAA's DSCOVR spacecraft, for a severe storm, it is 19 minutes.
For typical storms, it is more like an hour.
Senator Peters. So 19 minutes to an hour, would you act
that fast?
Ms. Evans. Yes, sir. The intent is to have the information
available for the Secretary to respond that fast for the
Nation. That is what we are building.
Chairman Johnson. But would the order be to shut the entire
grid down?
Ms. Evans. Not necessarily.
Mr. Aaronson. Not necessarily.
One of the things that the Sector Coordinating Council has
been doing in partnership with the Department of Energy is to
develop template orders, so that we are not figuring out what
orders look like the day that they happen, but actually have
some things and have an understanding of if this, then this. So
that is going to be extremely important.
I would say shutting down the grid so that equipment is not
impacted is an option, but one of the things that the existing
operating procedure standard requires would be--or not
requires, but enables is reliability coordinators who have
responsibility for liability within a region would be able to
spin out the additional reserves or have additional capacity in
that particular area in case of some sort of loss of load.
I would rely on the engineers over here, but there are a
lot of different ways to protect against GMD.
Chairman Johnson. The point of shutting down would be to
protect the equipment. You are not talking about throwing more
things on the load.
Dr. Baker, you have been pretty patient. Then Mr.
McClelland. Dr. Baker.
Mr. Baker. In answer to the question about what do we need
to do, one of the most important things is to get EMP up on the
same footing as GMD. We have a GMD standard. There is nothing.
There is no guidance at all on EMP. As a result, industry is
not doing very much of anything.
On the question of modeling, we have done modeling of the
grid. FERC has done it. Wellinghoff pointed to if you could
take out--if the right nine substations, you could shut down
the United States for 18 months, 9 substations. We have a
pretty good idea.
Chairman Johnson. Do not tell us which ones. [Laughter.]
Mr. Baker. What?
Chairman Johnson. Do not mention which ones.
Mr. Baker. OK.
But there have been models, and there are things that we
know that we could take charge, move out now to protect the
substations that are the key to keeping the bulk power grid
running, anyway.
Chairman Johnson. We know that, but we have not done
anything about it----
Mr. Baker. No.
Chairman Johnson [continuing]. Or very little about it.
Mr. Baker. Right.
Chairman Johnson. Do you dispute the fact that we do not
have any EMP standards and we are really not doing anything
about EMP.
Mr. Roop. The industry has done quite a bit, ever since the
FERC comments over the number of substations could be impacted
across the grid. That is one of the reasons why we work with
Oak Ridge Labs and the industry to develop the probability risk
assessment is to really understand where your stress points
were.
That has been shared with the industry. It has really
helped us pinpoint which substations need to be hardened,
physically from cyber, for EMP, and we have almost completed
that hardening, all of ours.
The industry is doing the same. It has been shared through
NERC now in a guide.
So there is a lot that has been done, and we have refined
the early FERC work. I think we have better actions as to where
to go. We have done a lot. That is the type of risk you do not
share because it is telling the adversary what the targets are.
Chairman Johnson. I understand.
OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TOOMEY
Senator Toomey. Can I ask you a quick technical question?
In the scenario in which you had some notice of a significant
GMD event and you were able to shut down some portion or all of
the grid, how much protection does that provide? When it
passes, do you turn the switch back on, and everything is fine,
or has a great deal of damage been done, but not as much as
what would have been done? Doctor.
Mr. Baker. I was involved in a big DOE session to define
their EMP action plan, and we had a very large utility,
electric power grid contingent there. They told me--I was
leading the discussion--that they wanted to resist shutting the
grid down at all costs, that shutting the grid down would cause
more problems because of the startup voltage transients. When
you try to restart the grid, you get these electric voltage
overshoots that will damage equipment, and so a shutdown is not
a panacea.
Chairman Johnson. That is not a solution. Mr. McClelland.
Mr. McClelland. There is so much to comment on.
To begin with, if we look at operator action, manual
action, there is a standard by NERC now, EMP 10, that does
require a space weather forecasting and mitigation plans in the
event of a space weather event.
To answer the question from earlier on, a good forecast
would help an operator better prepare to take action.
However, the Commission found that operator action alone is
not sufficient. There will be times whenever operators make
errors, there should be automatic equipment available that
would override and take action to stop the GMD event.
To the other point concerning the rigor of the NERC
standards, any level, any threshold that one picks for GMD is
certainly going to be exceeded.
The question would be how far in excess, or a better
question would be what to do to automatically protect the
equipment.
The assessments that NERC lists are the beginning of a
process. That process, the expectation I would have for the
process, is that any transformer manufacturer or any
transformer owner is going to look at the exceed level. What is
the level at which that transformer is going to be overwhelmed
and take damage or be destroyed? At that point, that
transformer should be tripped off automatically. That is not an
expensive solution. That is a very targeted solution that can
be put into place. The technology exists, so a relay with a
pickup coil on the neutral bushing of the transformer, and then
you can debate and study what level of space weather event you
might have.
Also, to the question about notice, although better
forecasting would certainly help with the GMD event, if the
operator were prepared to take action and everything goes
right, it is not going to necessarily help with an EMP event.
One of the nice things about mitigating GMD, if the GMD is
done right, it will also mitigate E3 on the EMP event,
regardless of what level one selects.
Randy and I can talk about that level later on, but for a
GMD event, FERC did find--and it is a matter of perspective
also. You asked earlier on why the subject-matter experts
disagree. It really is a matter of assumptions, and it is a
matter of a basis for setting the threat. What is the threat,
and how much rigor do you place on the threat? What level of
space weather, for instance, do you pick to mitigate against?
But if you are doing it on a protection basis--because even
if you harden a transformer, at what point will the transformer
be exceeded?
Chairman Johnson. Let me just say--and I will turn to Mr.
Kasper--if I were king, I would say shutting down the grid is
not an option, it is not going to happen, cannot react in time.
It is just going to be too damaging in and of itself. That goes
to your automatic mitigation. That is what we are trying to do.
What technology can we bring to bear?
Richard Garwin said $100,000 capacity for protection of all
this. I do not think that is necessarily true. You are talking
some kind of breaker system.
For GMD, might be able to do it. EMP is just too rapid-
acting.
What we are trying to accomplish in this roundtable is to
set up a--I do not want to say a ``process.'' I want to come up
with things we can actually do. We will spend the money.
We heard in your testimony. You said about $50 billion. In
comparison to the catastrophe, that is money pretty well spent,
and it can certainly be recovered through fees and everything
else.
We have to come up with some action items, even if we do
not get it right. I do not care if it is not 100 percent
perfect. It is a lot better than the position we are in, and it
is well worth the money spent to mitigate the risk. Mr. Kasper.
Mr. Kasper. One of the items I touched on earlier was the
regional forecasts, and I think one of the issues right now is
not only do we only provide an hour to 20 minutes warning, but
we have like a thumb-up in the solar wind, ``It is OK,'' ``It
is getting intense now.'' Well, you can clearly see there is
more than one parameter that affects the severity of the storm.
I also think if we could deliver a regional forecast, I
think it would be a lot easier to contemplate shutting off New
England for a few hours than shutting off all of North America.
So now only do I think we need spacecraft that are closer
to the Sun to give more time, but we need to be able to provide
people with better data than just one number for how all of
Earth is going to respond to each event.
Chairman Johnson. Mr. Roop, again, please speak to shutting
down the grid.
Mr. Roop. Yes. That is something we do not do lightly. I
will be very honest with you.
Chairman Johnson. Right. And why?
Mr. Roop. But we have a lot of resiliency built into the
grid, and what we have done with the power transformers is--
typically, they have a lot of ``thermal margin,'' we call it.
That is what they get stressed at.
What we have done now is every one we buy, it has 125
percent overload, extra thermal margin to it, and they have
also have components to reduce the stress level from heating.
If you overload a transformer or you overheat it, we may
lose life, but that does not mean it is going to fail right
away.
So you take risk every day. If we have a major event going
on in the United States today and we have to overload a
transformer for a period of time, we will do that and take risk
on the loss of life of that unit. That is what we would do in
those kind of events in lieu of collapsing the grid.
Chairman Johnson. It all depends on the magnitude of the
overload, and the problem with EMP or a significant GMD event,
the overload may be so dramatic that there is just no safety
factor in the transformer, right?
Mr. Roop. Well, if you get to that level, you are going to
have voltage collapse, and our protective systems will drop the
system out automatically at that point.
I call it ``safety valves,'' for a better word, in the
system built in to be able to react to that.
We also have system operators that if they see a severe
contingency, they have the rights and the authority to drop
that area, and we do that.
Chairman Johnson. But, again, EMP occurs in fractions of a
second, right?
Mr. Roop. That is right.
Chairman Johnson. Dr. Baker.
Mr. Baker. This same group of industry representatives at
the DOE plan development, I was surprised. They said, ``We
would like to protect the grid, so we do not have to shut it
off.'' There are protective devices where--they are still under
test, but it may be possible that you could at least protect
portions of the grid, so it would operate through a GMD, a
severe GMD, or an EMP.
Chairman Johnson. Again, that is really the purpose of this
roundtable is to identify those priority items that we can
actually do. If there is equipment now and we can upgrade as
technology improves, but start doing something now.
Senator Peters. Mr. Vespalec, you mentioned something in
your system. What was it? A device?
Mr. Vespalec. A neutral-insertion device.
Senator Peters. Yes. Would you elaborate on that, and would
that be a potential action----
Chairman Johnson. That is strictly for GMD, though,
correct?
Mr. Vespalec. Well, it has some effect too on the E3 for
EMP.
Senator Peters. Yes. Would you elaborate on all that and
let us know what it would protect?
Mr. Vespalec. It is an automatic device that senses when
that DC type of current is flowing, and it will interrupt it to
protect the transformer.
It is a prototype, what we have, and we put it in a
substation with just one transformer, knowing that if it
interrupts that current, we want to know what would happen to
the rest of the system. It is a little bit like Whack-A-Mole.
If you stop the current flowing in that transformer, it has to
go somewhere. It looks for another path.
Chairman Johnson. Right.
Mr. Vespalec. We are trying to monitor to see how is this
going to react with the rest of the system and the effect to
other transformers.
Chairman Johnson. I am certainly mindful of the complexity
of this and that you put something in here and you have to be
really careful about how to fix the rest of the grid.
Mr. Vespalec. Correct.
Chairman Johnson. I do understand that.
Again, if you want to talk, put your name tag up like Dr.
Baker.
Senator Peters. Mr. Aaronson, go ahead.
Mr. Aaronson. Thank you both.
Similar to Mr. McClelland, I have a lot that I want to
react to, but I think what you just heard from both Mr.
Vespalec and Dr. Baker about the complexity, about the testing,
and the potential unintended consequences is a really big deal.
This notion that nothing is happening, except we are admiring
the problem, actually we are admiring the problem in the wild
right now by actually deploying different potential solutions
and mitigation strategies.
Some of the mitigation strategies, as you are noting, are
to prevent impact from happening.
Another way that we look at resilience is you cannot
protect everything from everything all of the time. If we are
talking about an intelligent adversary, we have to be right 100
percent of the time. The adversary has to be right once. We
also have to be focusing on response recovery, preparing for a
potential impact.
In addition to what we are talking about with blocking
devices and some of those things, Mr. Roop referred some of the
spare equipment programs that we have.
Something else that we are developing at the direction of
the Sector Coordinating Council known as ``Supplemental
Operating Strategies (SOS)'', this notion that can we operate
the grid in a degraded sense. So there is impact.
I will push back on that nine substation remark real
quickly too. That was based on static modeling, and the idea is
if those nine substations evaporated and we had no other
contingencies, there would be impact to the system. Even if
they evaporated, we have other ways to pick up that load. We
have other ways to engineer around those problems.
You see it all the time. You saw what happened in Mexico
Beach, for example, down in the Panhandle of Florida after
Hurricane Irma this past year--or Hurricane Michael, rather,
this past year. There was impact there. We were able to rebuild
the system in a short order, and the rest of the surrounding
area was able to get back up and running fairly quickly.
This is one of the ways that we are taking physical natural
hazards and applying our resilience and recovery methods to
potential cyber, physical, or EMP-type events.
So looking at it at all hazards, looking at it not just
before the incident, but what we do to respond and recover,
having Supplemental Operating Strategies, being able to operate
manually, being able to move equipment around, these things--
and I think you noted it Chairman Johnson. These pieces of
equipment are enormous. They are critical to the effective
operation of the grid.
We have a lot of spare equipment that is not operational
today that cannot just be put into service in a place where it
might need to be, but also we have been working with, again,
cross-sector, the transportation sector to be able to move
these things as expeditiously as possible.
The last thing I want to say--and I am sorry that Senator
Rosen is not here anymore, but very direct question of what can
Congress do to help, I think we are all kind of falling on some
things that would help.
Money is always. If you are talking about national security
and you are talking about mil spec, rather than customers
bearing the cost of something that is a national security
issue, there are ways that I think we can find Federal money to
do some of these things.
I think in the spirit of money, also, working with us in
our commissions at the State and Federal level so that these
costs can be recovered, so support for cost recovery, having
your leadership, ``This really matters, State commission. This
is why this company is coming for cost recovery,'' I think is
going to carry a lot of weight.
Earlier warning was already discussed.
Chairman Johnson. Let me just chime in.
Mr. Aaronson. Yes.
Chairman Johnson. As a fiscal conservative, I will carry
the water as long as I know what it is we are supposed to do.
Mr. Aaronson. Amen.
Chairman Johnson. That is what has been so frustrating to
me. It is just what can we do? Let us actually act. Let us
actually spend some money on things that actually mitigate.
Mr. Aaronson. This is why EPRI's work is so important.
I think if we would have done some of the--``Oh, this is
the right thing to do. It is mil spec. It is easy. We have done
it for 20 years. Why are not we doing it on the electric
sector?'' we might have had unintended consequences. We might
not have had sound mitigation. We probably would have lost 3 or
4 years.
By doing sound science not, getting specific mitigation,
and then--and I do not know if Randy is able to say this or
not, but following this report, companies are not just going to
take the report and say, ``Oh, now we know what mitigation
looks like.'' Companies are going to pilot some of these
mitigation strategies so that we can do it out in the wild.
Once we have a better sense of what mitigation looks like,
there might be ways--maybe very specific asks for funding.
The last thing I would say, access to classified
information, I do not think this has been as big a problem this
go-around with EPRI and their work with DOD, but being able to
see what does an EMP from a high-altitude nuclear weapon really
look like on our system at a very highly classified level so
that we can make informed decisions based on the things that
Dr. Baker probably knows.
Chairman Johnson. OK. Mr. Harrell, Dr. Baker, and then Ms.
Evans.
Mr. Harrell. Thank you very much.
Just as a former regulator and kind of somebody who has
been regulated and now kind of seeing this through a government
lens, I do want to suggest that a lot of investments within
industry, within particularly this industry, have been made.
I will point back to some of the action items that have
come up over the last number of years, really since 2006-2007
timeframe, and I will point to the grid security exercise that
NERC did many years ago.
The first one was back in 2011. Every other year, there has
been an exercise since, and they have really taken a hard look
at some of the catastrophic grid reliability issues, and this
certainly would be in that same vein.
I do want to suggest that there is a lot of work and a lot
of thought that has gone behind a reliability issue.
As DHS pushed out their 2018 strategy and soon to be an
implementation plan, I do want to suggest that we have started
to get a lot more granular as to the risks associated with not
necessarily EMP, but all risks.
So right now, we are in the process of moving toward
mapping the national critical functions, and what does that
mean kind of underneath it where we get a little bit of
granular? The things that we need in which to operate critical
infrastructure in this country, what is it? So that we can kind
of pinpoint what actually needs to be mitigated based off of a
risk.
Chairman Johnson. That is fine. I want to solve all the
problems, but I would like to solve this one now. Let us kind
of take a step-by-step approach.
I believe it is Dr. Baker and then Ms. Evans.
Mr. Baker. Yes, a couple of things.
One is the NERC exercises did not include EMP, at least to
my knowledge. The other point is I would venture--this is
something we need to check, but I suspect if you protect
transformers to the EMP E3, as specified in the Mil-Standard
188-125, they will also survive any GMD.
Now, we have not done any testing of the large
transformers, but the first transformer, which Duke Energy has
made available, we are going to test down in South Carolina.
I think we need to look into the possibility that if you
protect the heavy duty grid components, the transformers and
substations and generator step-up transformers to the EMP E3,
they will also survive GMD.
Chairman Johnson. But, again, they are still vulnerable to
E1 and E2, correct?
Mr. Baker. Right. But I am just looking at the GMD.
If you protect to the EMP standard, mil spec, you will also
have protected to GMD.
Chairman Johnson. OK. I think I have always assumed that. I
thought GMD pretty well was EMP, correct?
Mr. Baker. It is very close, but we need to do some
testing, obviously.
Chairman Johnson. Good enough for government work.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Baker. But, again--and I am pushing back on what Randy
said--the Mil-Standard 181-125 tells you how to test
transformers, 1,000 amps per phase, and that is unclassified.
Chairman Johnson. I am going to lose Senator Peters here
pretty quick, but do not worry. I will stick around.
Senator Peters, do you have any other questions before you
have to leave?
OK. Ms. Evans.
Ms. Evans. Oh, thank you.
The one thing that I really want to stress and I think Dr.
Baker has put this in his action items is it is not to reinvent
the wheel but to leverage a lot of the work that has already
been done by DOD.
Our National Labs, because a lot of this stuff that people
are talking about is, oh, we are actually testing on the live
system, we have directed our National Labs to be able to
actually simulate and do assessments under these scenarios.
To your point about you need to have the data in order to
be what can we do today, what is the long-range plan, and what
is that road map, that is specifically why we are a putting
this road map together so that we can have this data.
But the labs are working on this now. We--and whether you
agree or not--and I think it has been said by DHS and also by
Caitlin earlier--is that the risk of some of this is low in how
it is going to happen, but when it does happen, the effects are
catastrophic, right? So we all agree on that.
So the way that we are doing the work is prioritizing it
based on the risk across the board, but taking into effect,
especially what Mr. Aaronson has said, is, OK, we do this in
other areas, so this is another threat that we have to build
into the current scenarios that we have.
To your point, there is testing. There is the assessments.
We are leveraging the National Lab capabilities because they do
the work for DOD as well. So we are not reinventing that. We
are trying to make sure that we have the data that we can share
out so that it informs everyone's decision as we go forward.
Chairman Johnson. The extent we are designing solutions, if
you can have a solution for multiple problems. If you are shut
down and you have to recover, probably similar process, whether
it is cyber, whether it is EMP, whether it is GMD.
Ms. Evans. Absolutely.
Chairman Johnson. So, again----
Ms. Evans. So you have to be able to test that scenario in
a testing lab environment because you really do not want to
affect your customers while you are putting on, OK, this is a
prototype equipment. What is the effect of that going to be?
What are the scenarios? What are the assumptions if we
implement this type of standards?
We have directed the labs. They have been working on this
since--on 2018 and 2019, we are continuing this work, so that
we can say, ``And here is the data. Here is the impact. Do you
want to accelerate that? Because that is a risk that we are not
willing to take as a Nation.'' That is the kind of information
I think Congress needs to have to be able to get to the point
that you want to take an action and I am willing to do this.''
Chairman Johnson. I think that is the purpose of this
roundtable. I realize this is, hopefully, a very low
probability. Certainly, EMP is a very low probability. I think
it is a growing probability, unfortunately. GMD is not if, but
when.
So we are trying to raise this profile. We have sat back
and we just have not done very many things. It has not raised
the type of--let us face it--the awareness like climate change.
Let us throw hundreds of billions of dollars at climate change,
just in case. Well, I think we ought to do something just in
case here.
A little off point, because I am the Chairman of Homeland
Security and on Foreign Relations, I am aware of what Russia
did from a cyber standpoint in Ukraine, and it is my
understanding, being nontechnical, the only reason Ukraine was
able to reestablish and startup their grid is because they had
the old-fashion breakers.
I know there is a bill pending. I think it is Senator King
and Senator Risch.
By the way, I was at Idaho National Lab, great facility,
wonderful people, talking way over my head, but I appreciate
that.
I think $10 million a study, where should we maybe put some
lower-technology breakers? I am hoping all of you take a look
at that as well.
Mr. Roop, are you smiling on that one? We will get back
into EMP GMD as long as I have raised that issue. What are your
thoughts on that?
Mr. Roop. Well, what we have tried to do in the design of
our system is have manual override so we can bring the system
back up. That is extremely important, and you use a human
remote terminal unit (RTU), if you have to, to try to bring
your system back. We have manual overrides built in our system.
The problem is some of the protective relaying with the
dynamics we have on the system now, we have to use power
electronic relays or else the system gets unstable. That is the
reason why this next point, the next phase with the EPRI work
is so important. It is how I protect those relays cost
effectively is to me, where we have to get soon as an industry
so we can fast deploy that.
So there are some very specific research areas that we have
been led to with the EPRI work. The stuff that is low-hanging
fruit--and I will call it--it will not hurt the system, we go
ahead and do. We have already done that in our standards. The
industry is doing it. Other utilities across this industry are
already looking at the preliminary reports with EPRI, and we
have been doing that across the networks.
But there are some specific areas that we really need to
address quickly if we want to get ahead of this problem, and
that is where the labs can help us because if some of the
technology we try do not work, we are going to need to figure
out what will work. So that partnership is extremely important
for us, and that is where the government really can help us in
the next phase here.
Chairman Johnson. But, again, do you not agree that until
the government establishes a standard, you are going to be
incredibly reluctant to invest a whole lot of money? Because
you just might get the standards next year and have to redo the
whole thing. Is that not a real deterrent?
I appreciate what Dominion has already done, what Edison
has done, but I think you probably would have done a lot more
if we would had given you some kind of basic standards to
adhere to.
Mr. Roop. That always makes it easier, but I am not sure
standards is the answer in this case, at this point yet.
Chairman Johnson. OK.
Mr. Roop. We really need to know what to do, and that is
where I am at right today, I think.
Chairman Johnson. I want to respond to the people putting
the name tage up, like this.
Dr. Baker. I got rules.
Mr. Baker. Yes. Good point from Roop there.
Another thing--and it is going along with his observation--
one of the things that we really need are some national test
beds that are dedicated to testing integrated systems, the
relays, the generation stations, the substations in a connected
mode.
We found with EMP that assessments and models that are just
based upon analysis are wrong. They are wrong. They are
inaccurate. You may as well flip a coin as to whether the
system is hard or not. The only way that you get any kind of
confidence that you have a system that is hard is to test it,
and so these test beds are important.
Chairman Johnson. Creating a test bed is not that
expensive, is it? I know you have one in Idaho.
Mr. Baker. Idaho is building one. There is one at Tennessee
Valley Authority (TVA), and there are some in situ tests that
are being set up. But that is an area where I think funding
could be very helpful.
Chairman Johnson. Mr. McClelland and then Mr. Aaronson.
Mr. McClelland. So there are really two aspects to this.
One is the natural threat, and on the natural threat side, I
think you have correctly said that you have to narrow the
mitigation action.
Right now, it is based on operator action, and I would say
that automatic protection measures should also be considered
and strengthened, and that is in the implementation plan.
If I get a level that overwhelms the transformer, I could
still take that transformer off automatically. It is isolated
to the transformer. The whole grid does not come down.
But when it is----
Chairman Johnson. But, again, do you have enough time even
with GMD?
Mr. McClelland. I am sorry?
Chairman Johnson. Do you have enough time to do that even
with GMD?
Let us say it is kind of localized. We have had this in the
past, go back and----
Mr. McClelland. No, no, no, no.
It would have to be--in my opinion, you should not--as an
engineer that has been in the industry, one should never rely--
if it is a critical function, never rely on operator action
alone. There are always automatic controls, automatic relays,
automatic operation of the equipment.
Chairman Johnson. Again, do the automatic relays work in
GMD?
Mr. McClelland. Yes. You can install automatic relays in
GMD, and I will talk with Dave after this. But to sense DC, DC
input on a transformer is not--in my opinion, it is not
difficult to sense that operator relay and take that particular
transformer off because, if you looked at some of the latest
modeling, the GMD vectors can be very specific to very
different transformers under different GMD scenarios.
Chairman Johnson. Was that part of your standard, then,
that FERC gave to NERC, gave to industry?
Mr. McClelland. Absolutely not. It was not part of the
standard, but it was a baseline. As I said, those are baseline
practices that start the discussion and start the industry
moving.
So now everyone has a requirement. They have to evaluate
their system. They have to do an assessment. They have to do a
correction action plan, and they have to mitigate to certain
levels.
Now, if it is 8 volts per kilometer or if it is 75 or 85
amps per phase, one could argue that that is certainly going to
be exceeded or not adequate for a significant GMD event.
But, again, to the point, you will always have GMD events
that exceed that threshold, and so in that case, I would submit
one would never count on a single standard to protect that
transformer. One should put protection on that transformer, and
that is something industry knows how to do, and they have done
it forever.
So that is something that could be done, and I feel it
could be done targeted, and it could be done, I think, quickly
and not very expensive. The Commission can provide cost
recovery, but I am sorry. I did not want to miss the EMP issue
either because EMP, the bad news is you have an intelligent
adversary that studies our systems and vulnerabilities and is
building weapon systems around those vulnerabilities.
The good news is you have an intelligent adversary that
studies our systems and vulnerabilities and is building weapon
systems around that because to DOE's work, they are working on
defense critical electric infrastructure. If those facilities
survive in the event of an EMP attack--and that is a very
narrow subset. If they survive, my personal opinion that is a
strong dissuasion for an adversary to perpetrate an attack.
Chairman Johnson. For a couple nuclear powers, but there
may be a couple that I am not sure that you can do anything to
dissuade them.
Mr. McClelland. That is correct. No doubt. That is where it
is a broader subset to say what are the major societal impacts.
We are losing very specific, very critical facilities, and
that comes into that narrowing, the modeling, the engagement
with industry to identify those facilities and put protection
in place.
Right now, DOD, DTRA, is doing a tremendous job in
hardening the DOD assets. They are moving with all haste, and
they are spending a lot of money.
The same thing can be done with proper engagement with the
industry, not to set a standard, but to engage with them about
what are these critical--brief them, to their point, about
classified information. What are those critical threats? Is it
real? What can we do to protect against it, and what is our
really all levels of protection mitigation?
Just to go to an earlier point, there are still entities
that have analog, old electromechanical relays out there, and
if you read the System Electronic Registration Approval (SERA)
study, they do very well against EMP attack. It may not be
possible to put them everywhere, but in cases where operations
could be dead-banded with electromechanical relays, that is an
excellent solution set. That is one that should be considered,
and that is one that some of the international partners who we
are working with--that is one that they are employing.
So there are targeted mitigations for specific systems that
can be put into place. These can be done quickly. My opinion,
they can be done quickly with industry engagement, proper
incentives, and I really do not see a reason----
Chairman Johnson. Reimbursement.
Mr. McClelland [continuing]. We could not get it.
Chairman Johnson. Mr. Aaronson, first of all, respond to
what you talked about, surge protection on transformers for
GMD. But just in general respond, and then make the point you
wanted to make.
Mr. Aaronson. So, no, I cannot respond on that. These guys
over here can.
I am actually really glad that Mr. McClelland because I
want to associate myself with a number of his comments. I think
he said a lot of important things. He was talking about
prioritization there at the end. Is it the Defense Critical
Electric Infrastructure (DCEI)? Is it that one order, one level
down to some of the societal needs, life, health, safety, first
responders, things like that?
The President's National Infrastructure Advisory Council,
recently did a report--I happen to be on the study group--for
catastrophic power outages, and I will say we have learned a
lot from recent history, not just the storms that have impacted
most of the United States or the wildfires out west or what
happened in Puerto Rico, but now to bring back what you brought
up about Ukraine, those are the supplemental operating
strategies that we are talking about.
What happened in Ukraine, I like to tell people, is my
favorite kind of incident because it happened to somebody else,
but we can learn from it. And we are.
So you are exactly right. One of the reasons that they were
able to get back up and running as quickly as they were--so
225,000 people lost power for a few hours. It was a bad day, to
be sure, but it was not catastrophic to that country. They were
able to go back to the good old pistol-grip handles, and I like
that, the human RTU.
In order to have that human remote terminal unit, you need
to be able to talk to that person in the field. You need a
person in the field who is trained on what it is that they are
going to be doing.
Now, it may not pretty. The other joke we have had, it is
not just Supplemental Operating Strategies. It is the MacGyver
Project. How do we hold the grid together with bubble gum and
duct tape in the event of a truly catastrophic incident?
I will give an example about sort of levels of magnitude
for an incident. In Super Storm Sandy, there was a company that
had storm walls for one of their key substations for a 14-foot
storm surge. The highest that had ever happened in that
location was 10 feet. They were way above whatever a baseline
storm would do. Super Storm Sandy was 16 feet of storm surge.
Since then, they have not ripped out that substation and
started something new. Instead, they have actually built some
pretty creative, pretty low-tech solutions. They have storm
walls that one person can go in and shut.
I think what we have to do is not just rely exclusively on
standards, to the points that have been made. They do provide a
great foundation, but also understand that there are going to
be incidents that strain our imaginations of what could happen.
Again, this goes back to that left of boom versus right of
boom. We should absolutely spend time and resources and effort
to prepare, protect, detect, defend, exercise, but also to
prepare, to respond, and recover, so----
Chairman Johnson. We should be looking for simple
solutions. Take a look at after the September 11, 2001 (9/11).
The simplest solution and most effective, we just hardened the
cockpit doors, kind of like ``duh.''
The nuclear accident in Japan, put cooling towers up on
top, OK? Do not rely on the electrical pumps.
Mr. Aaronson. That is right.
Chairman Johnson. Again, yes, absolutely. Do not look for
some elegant, expensive solution. Look for the simplest
solution as possible.
Real quick before I go to Dr. Baker and Ms. Evans.
Mr. Roop, I would just like to ask your opinion of
basically what Mr. McClelland was talking about on GMD, the
surge protectors, easy, simple, boom, or not?
Mr. Roop. I am not sure exactly the surge protector he has
referred to.
We use metal-oxide varistors (MOVs) on our transmission
system, and we are looking at very high-speed surge protection
on the secondary for our relay protection.
The problem is I have 65,000 relays in my system, and about
60 percent of them are digital. They have about 30 or 40 points
on the back of that relay. If I had to put a surge protector
across all of them, I have to make sure I do not short out
something or open something that could create another
consequence. That is why we are trying to see is there a
simpler solution than putting one on every terminal point, and
that is where we may need the labs to help us figure out what
is the right answer to that.
As far as the comment about electromechanical relays, there
are areas in our network we can use them, and we are still
using them.
The suppliers are trying to get out of that business, so
that will be a problem for us down the road. So that is also
part of our strategy, but they cannot be used everywhere on
some of our extra high voltage (EHV) systems because of
stability concerns. But that is some of the things we have to
do.
Chairman Johnson. So there is one of the problems you have
to solve is you have to maintain a supplier base, and that is
maybe something you have to support if we view that as a
mission-critical or national security issue. Dr. Baker.
Mr. Baker. Because EMP affects such larger areas--you are
talking about footprints that are 1,000-plus miles in
diameter--I think that we do need to have some standards or
guidelines because the grids are so interconnected that if you
do not have some uniform protection on the grid, if the
protection is just sort of random, one part of the grid failing
will pull down other parts of the grid, as we saw in 2003. A
small perturbation in one location caused a large part of the
Northeast grid to change.
I think standards are something that should be on the
table, and we ought to think about that, just as we have the
GMD benchmarks.
The other point I would make is I think right now, there is
entirely too much emphasis on recovery. The way I am reading
the tea leaves is people have this idea, we will just let the
grid fail, and then we will just have elaborate recovery plans
to be able to pick up the pieces afterwards.
We need to protect as much and keep operating as much of
the grid as possible, so that we do not have to get into these
modes where we are operating in the dark. We want to keep as
much of the grid up as possible.
Chairman Johnson. I want to quickly go to Ms. Durkovich
because I know you have a timeline. You have not spoken yet.
Ms. Durkovich. Thank you very much, Chairman, and I want to
pull a string on something that Scott was talking about related
to just lessons learned from other environmental hazards.
Certainly, the industry, year after year, gets better in
both preparing for and responding to hurricanes. That is in
part because there has been a very healthy dialogue around
forecasting, and the sooner that industry can know about a
storm, the sooner they start to take action.
From the moment that storm, that ingest becomes a named
storm, things are done across the electric sector. I think that
is an important part of the conversation certainly that we had
when we did the Space Weather Task Force is really learning
about what are the timeframes that industry needs to begin to
take action. I think that is an important conversation that
needs to continue.
One of the things that I think would be interesting, again,
around preparedness, especially as we come to some conclusions
about what are helpful mitigation measures is each year, FEMA
hosts an annual hurricane briefing, where they bring together
all of the interagency. Industry comes in. There is also a
national hurricane conference. The goal of this is both to talk
about what the hurricane season is going to look like. Do we
expect it is going to be bad? Do we expect it is going to be
good? We know a little bit, something about the cycles of space
weather, right, and where we are and what we can anticipate,
and especially if we are in this--if not, when and the 100-year
storm window.
I also think that it would serve to both continue to raise
awareness. You are sitting with people who think about this,
who have learned forward. There is a large part of industry and
other industries, the mid to small-size power providers that
maybe do not have as much awareness or as much resources, and
we need to continue to make sure that what David is learning at
Dominion can be passed down to them, but that we can also learn
from events where we do have near-misses or mild storms, what
worked, what did not work, and continue to promulgate those
among industry and academia.
I think it is a simple thing, but doing it on an annual
basis continues to raise awareness about the risk. That is
where we have a problem. It brings people together to talk
about what we know is working, what we can do better, and I
think there is an element here that might also contribute to
public awareness about this, which I will tell you is very low.
And you ask the average American. I will ask you when I
stepped into DHS and into my role as Assistant Secretary, I
certainly did not know that space weather would be something
that we would be dealing with.
Chairman Johnson. It is not why I ran for Senate.
Ms. Durkovich. Thank you, if I do not have an opportunity
to provide comments again, for including me today in this
important conversation.
Chairman Johnson. Well, thank you for attending, you raised
a pretty interesting point. It kind of harkens back to some of
the points that Dr. Baker made in his testimony.
Here in the Federal Government, we are talking about the
top down. What do we need to do? Top down. But there is an
awful lot of bottom up. That is why I appreciate the types of
things that Dominion Electric is doing on its own, absent
better direction from the Federal Government.
Again, thank you for coming and safe travels home. Ms.
Evans.
Ms. Evans. I wanted to follow on exactly what Caitlin is
saying is that I think I would offer a way to look at this is
that there are a lot of lessons learned from what we do from a
natural disaster type of prevention, prepositioning resources
in order to be able to do things.
My particular office is focused on energy security as well
as emergency response and cyber. So the whole idea is what do
we have to look at from a sector-specific? How do we respond,
and how do we preposition?
I think some of the things that Dr. Baker is looking at is
that that is after, as we continuously do things. OK. This is
the way the response works. This is how things are happening.
This is the data associated with it, and it leads into we
should have a minimum standard.
I think several of these things are going on concurrently,
and to go out on one versus the other, it all has to inform it.
I think that is really what--to Joe's point, we are doing these
things currently. To leap right out and say yes, you have to
have a standard, it is a long process, but it has to be
informed by the practical exercises and activities that
industry is doing now, so that we know what the impact of that
is going to be, so that we can answer the question to you. So
these are all going on concurrently, and it informs the
standard process.
I know you want an action like, yes, let us do a standard,
but I think you want a standard that is informed that then can
actually be able to say, ``Yes, we are prepared. We are
prepositioning. We work with industry. We are utilizing these
things going forward,'' and this is how the Nation is
responding to the risk.
Chairman Johnson. What I am looking for is--somebody
mentioned the low-hanging fruit. Let us at least start doing
the low-hanging fruit. You are never going to have perfect
information. We have been doing this a long time, and I will
still say there has been minimal mitigation efforts that would
really be effective, that are really protecting us here. We are
still incredibly vulnerable to this.
I am trying to reduce our vulnerability. I am trying to
take actions to start mitigating it, so that there is some
level of survivability. Mr. McClelland.
Mr. McClelland. I am not sure my comment will help in that
perspective, but with your permission, I did want to make one
clarification, and that was to the E1 mitigation that Mr. Roop
comments on.
E1 is not as easy. If there are electromechanical relays in
place, E1 is--and if you can leave those in place, then you
have a simple solution to leave those in place. Coincidentally,
they are impervious to cyberattacks. So you sort of have a
convergence of two threats there.
But I do think that E1 is solvable if the universe is
narrowed. To the industry's point, if this is truly a national
security matter and an important and urgent national security
matter and action needs to be taken, then the industry needs to
be told that this is what needs to occur, and then the
engagement has to begin--and if you want it done quickly, on a
narrow subset. I would suggest that what the work that DOE has
done and to some degree DHS also, but that narrow subset should
pick up, to your earlier point on what are the best practices
we are using with DOD--because we are rushing and with haste.
We are mitigating against EMP at those critical DOD facilities.
It is not going to do any good if they do not have service
to the bases. So the point would be that is an area of focus
that I think could be done quickly. It would be complex, I
think to Dave's point, much--many of the relays, since the time
I was in the industry have become digital relays. They are much
more functional, and the grid is much more complex.
But it can be done, and it can be done, I think, much more
quickly on a narrow focus.
Chairman Johnson. Let us face it. I think the IC will
always assess that EMP is a very low-probability event, and I
would agree with that. God, let us hope so.
To a certain extent, I am looking at not a full solution
here, but are there common solutions? That if you had an EMP
attack and the grid was down, the same type of solutions, same
type of recovery systems would apply to cyber or GMD as well?
That is where I am--what are the common solutions here? What
are the common mitigating factors we can do?
I am not looking for perfection here. I am just looking to
start taking some steps.
Before we disband this, I do want to--because this is--as I
read your testimony, Dr. Baker, one of the action items that
really is very urgent is the whole issue about microgrids. I do
not fully understand them, so I would like to have people
respond a little bit to what Dr. Baker was talking about. There
are more and more microgrids being established. It does
increase the complexity of the grid, and if we do not--and the
mitigation cost to military standards for E1, E2, and E3, and
GMD is only 2 to 5 percent of construction cost. If all that is
true, it would seem to me--and if all that is required is the
Federal Government better create a standard for microgrids to
have them put that into the construction process, we ought to
do that pretty fast.
I would be looking to Senator Murkowski and my Senate
colleagues to raise the awareness, and let us get at least this
done.
I kind of want people's assessment of the whole microgrid
issue.
OK. There you go. I actually saw you wiggle.
Mr. Aaronson. I knew I had to put the sign up.
So a couple things about microgrids. I think people look at
them as the answer to resilience, if only we had all this
redundancy through microgrids.
Well, the existing grid is effectively a grid of grids.
That said, there is deployment of a lot of microgrids now.
Some of the companies that are deploying them, non-
utilities, are doing it on a very low margin to be cost
competitive in a lot of places, so 2 to 5 percent matters a lot
to them.
We see that problem with cybersecurity as well. You are
talking about very competitive technology space right now.
Adding complexity----
Chairman Johnson. What is the cost of a microgrid? What is
the cost range?
Mr. Aaronson. I would have to ask one of these guys.
Chairman Johnson. Are you talking $100 million? Are you
talking about $5 million?
Mr. Aaronson. Well, I mean, it really depends on the
application.
There is a good example of what would be considered a
microgrid that is jointly operated or that is operated by the
Hawaiian Electric Company.
Chairman Johnson. I am an accountant and a business guy. I
understand that 2 to 5 percent could kill us. That is where I
think the Federal Government can step in. If this was such an
important issue----
Mr. Aaronson. Right.
Chairman Johnson [continuing]. If this was so urgent, this
would be a blown opportunity not putting the standard into
those things. Just sort of allocate the money because it is
well worth it.
Mr. Aaronson. The 2 to 5 percent, that is something--so if
you are talking about a microgrid deployment on a military
installation, that is good for the military installation for
them to island themselves, if necessary, or to support the
surrounding community--again, there are examples of that. One
is particularly well known out in Hawaii, Schofield Barracks,
really built out a spectacular system. That is the kind of
place where you would absolutely look at, and especially when
you are talking about greenfield deployment.
There are examples of some of our companies who are
building new control centers, who are hardening some of their
control houses as they build new substations.
When you are talking about greenfield construction, adding
2 to 5 percent, that is worth every penny.
When you are talking about retrofit, the costs go up
tremendously.
Chairman Johnson. It is more expensive.
Mr. Aaronson. That is right.
With respect to the microgrids, though, I think what we
have to do is look at it in two ways. One is if it is a
microgrid deployment in a critical facility supporting critical
load, we need to think about all of the different ways that we
would harden and protect against--EMP, cyber, physical, etc.
If you are talking about a more commercial application that
does not have the same impact to life, health, and safety,
well, they are going to try to be cost competitive in whichever
way they can.
I am sorry I do not know the hard numbers, but I do think
you have to think about it from a cost-effectiveness standpoint
and where the deployment is.
The last thing I would say about microgrids is while they
do add both resilience, because you have some redundancy and
complexity, you still need that backstops, the enabler of the
broader grid. That is where companies like Dominion and ATC and
others come in.
Chairman Johnson. Dr. Baker.
Mr. Baker. The microgrids are normally used on systems that
are so critical that they cannot stand outages. They cannot
stand the .99 or .999 outage probability that you get with the
rest of the grid.
So the services, the infrastructure services you would be
protecting are going to be very, very critical. So that is
another impetus for looking at these.
The other point I would make that Scott--echo his, you need
to do not just EMP, but you need to look at cyber. When they
install microgrids, they are connecting the microgrid controls
to the regular grid controls and the controls on other
microgrids. So they call this ``aggregation,'' and just
remember this. Aggregation means aggravation in terms of
vulnerability.
But these things are proliferating and none of them is
hard. I do not think they are either EMP or cyber-hard, most of
them. So that is a low-hanging fruit for you.
Chairman Johnson. You are talking to an accountant that had
a PC with a 5\1/2\ inch floppy on my accounting system because
I knew that would never get hacked. I think since I have left,
they have improved that. I am reasonably cautious about those
things.
I am kind of out of questions. I think we have gone far
enough here.
I do again apologize for the clip nature of opening
statements. I hope you found this informative. I hope you found
it helpful. I certainly found it informative.
I want to give you a homework assignment, if you choose to
address it, because I did talk to Dr. Baker. I valued all of
your testimony. I truly did. I read all of it, and it was very
helpful.
Dr. Baker, because of what he has done in the military, he
has actually been participating in a system in government that
actually did this, hardened it, but also in his testimony,
throughout it, there were action items. I called him up, ``Can
you lay those out as a priority?''
What I would like all of you to do is make sure you have
his testimony. I would recommend you read it, but then look at
his priorities. You do not have to comment on all of it, but if
you have a comment on his testimony or a particular action
item, if you disagree with it, let me know. Then we can try and
figure out where is the discrepancy there. Otherwise, what I
will do is kind of view this as pretty authoritative and move
forward based on that.
So here is your chance to rip into poor old Dr. Baker and
say, ``We do not agree with this guy.'' [Laughter.]
Mr. Baker. You never explained that to me.
Chairman Johnson. I have been doing this a long time, and
the problem you have with EMP is you have people who have been
involved in this. God bless them because they have been raising
the alarm, they may be viewed as alarmists, maybe discounted. I
am not necessarily saying they should, but I think that has
been part of the problem.
I think on the other hand, you have industry that--I do not
blame you there is not a spec here. We are going to do what we
think is important, and we are going to address--what are the
high-probability threats? We have enough things to worry about
here versus addressing these low probability threats when
government is really not giving us any direction.
I am not laying any blame here. I understand exactly what
the dynamic is here. There is, I believe, a moment in time
here.
I like the fact that Senator Toomey, after I presented this
to our conferences as one of my top priorities, he came up to
me, ``Hey, Ron, I really want to work on this.''
Senator Rounds. I have talked to Senator Inhofe and Senator
Murkowski, Chairmen of both Senate Armed Services and the
Senate Energy Committee. These are the committees, the
committees of jurisdiction. Or where there is a must-pass piece
of legislation, maybe through the National Defense
Authorization Act (NDAA), we can actually do some of the top-
down legislation and enact it into law.
I will use the one example when I was interviewing
Secretary Nielsen for a position at DHS, and she talked about
CISA. That took us too long. We were kind of holding that, and
I thought corroborate so we could actually do the full DHS
reauthorization. The other thing she talked about was the fact
that we have no authority to mitigate against the malign use of
drones. I was shocked. Are you kidding me?
Fortunately, we had a video of an Islamic State of Iraq and
Syria (ISIS) drone going over an Iraqi target, lowering itself,
and then bombs away and pinpoint, destroying an Iraqi target.
Fortunately, I had that because I could show it in a Committee
Business Meeting, and at Senate lunch, and it got people's
attention. Not enough to get it through the NDAA, which I tried
to do, but finally through the Federal Aviation Administration
(FAA) Reauthorization.
So there are ways of doing what I think needs to be done,
but I would love to have everybody at this table in full
agreement of what the action items certainly are, from a top-
down approach, coming from the Federal Government, but then as
a best practice, through industry, the bottom up.
I just met with the local utilities, the electric co-ops.
They obviously do not want overregulation. I do not want to
overregulate them, but I certainly want to recognize this
problem and utilize the Federal Government because we are the
only entity that can really provide this kind of direction to
create action.
I could throw it open and say if anybody just has a burning
desire to say something, I will let youif you want it. If you
want to say a closing comment here, put your little name tage
up, and you are going to get glares from your fellow panelists.
[Laughter.]
Chairman Johnson. But if anybody wants to say something, I
will let you. Otherwise, do your homework assignment, and
please work with this Committee at determining what action
steps we should take, how can we codify it, because these
things, we will have to enact this into law. I think we have
some good partners, talking to Senator Murkowski, talking to
Senator Inhofe, talking to the Ranking Members, and talking to
Senator Peters. We have some people here that recognize this is
an issue, and that has not always been the case. I think we can
actually do some good work here and help you improve your
systems and keep this Nation safe.
So, again, thank you all for your testimony, for putting up
with me. I look forward to working with you. It may not be vice
versa, but let us work together and solve this problem, OK?
This business meeting is closed.
[Whereupon, at 4:31 p.m., the Committee meeting was
adjourned.
