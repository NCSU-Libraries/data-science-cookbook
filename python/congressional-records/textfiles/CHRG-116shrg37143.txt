OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CHUCK GRASSLEY, A U.S. SENATOR FROM
IOWA, CHAIRMAN, COMMITTEE ON FINANCE
The Chairman. I want to welcome and to thank our witnesses
for being here. We know that you put a lot of hard work into
it, and staffs and the Senators have done the same thing.
The information that these witnesses will share will help
inform the committee as it addresses the issues of high
prescription drug prices. America has a problem with the high
cost of prescription medicines.
Whether it is about EpiPen, insulin, or other
prescriptions, in the thousands of letters that I have
received, Iowans have made clear that high drug prices are
hurting. I have heard from people about skipping doses of their
prescription drugs to make them last until the next paycheck.
Of course, I am not a doctor, but rationing one medicine
does not sound like the safe prescription for health and
wellness that Americans want. Others have told me about leaving
their prescription on the pharmacy counter because it costs too
much.
There is no question that researchers and doctors have
developed treatments and cures for diseases where there were
once no such cures or treatments. And such innovations take
time and money. I think all of us at this table--and most
people who are not at this table--if they study at all the
pharmaceutical industry and the FDA process, they know it takes
time and money. But we are all trying to understand the sticker
shock that many drugs generate, especially when some of these
drugs have been around for a long, long time.
There is a balance then between incentivizing innovation
and keeping prices affordable for consumers and taxpayers. And
the taxpayers are involved, because the Federal Government is a
great purchaser of drugs through a lot of health programs.
Like all systems, things can get out of balance. The good
news is that we are here to discuss solutions. And we thank all
of you for cooperating with us in that effort today.
In fact, we are here today thanks to a system of checks and
balances that is within our Constitution. Congress has a
constitutional responsibility to be a meaningful check on the
spending of taxpayers' money. That responsibility includes not
just holding hearings, but also holding the private sector and
the government accountable through oversight, just like a
doctor. That doctor has to properly diagnose a disease before
it can be treated. Congress needs to understand what is going
on in the drug pricing supply chain in order to respond in a
measured and effective way.
As part of that fact-finding, as of the last Friday Ranking
Member Wyden and I launched an inquiry into the high cost of
insulin. This hearing is not about scapegoating any one group
regarding high drug costs. That is why we are holding a series
of bipartisan hearings on this issue.
Without a doubt, drug pricing is a complex issue. But I
think we should also be asking whether or not it is too complex
or whether it should be so complex. We cannot allow anyone to
hide behind the current complexities to shield the true cost of
drugs. And we should not turn a blind eye to industry practices
that thwart laws and regulations designed to promote
competition and generic drug entries into the marketplace.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, FDA
Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, and the Federal Trade Commission
have identified a number of tactics that undermine competition,
like withholding samples, pay-for-delay, product hopping, and
rebate bundling. And that just names a few. While these
agencies are taking enforcement action or looking at regulatory
changes, we here in Congress are exploring legislative options
to deter companies from engaging in these practices that keep
drug prices high for patients.
Today we expect open, honest answers from the
pharmaceutical industry to figure out how we got where we are
today and to see what ideas they have to make things better.
One of the first things that we need to talk about is
pretty simple: list price. Now you folks are probably going to
tell us it is not that simple. Secretary Azar has said that
pharmaceutical companies believe that the list price is
meaningless. In fact, some of your testimony today will echo
that.
However, for a patient taking a drug that has no
competition, the list price then becomes very meaningful. For
seniors on Part D or paying coinsurance as a percentage of list
price, then for that person, list price is very meaningful. For
people who have high-
deductible plans and pay thousands of dollars towards the list
price, then for those people, the list price is very
meaningful.
For pharmacy benefit managers, providing drugs with a high
list price can be more attractive than providing a less
expensive drug. Therefore, for the taxpayers then, the list
price becomes very meaningful.
We have all seen the finger-pointing. Every link in the
supply chain has gotten skilled at that finger-pointing. But
like most Americans, I at least--I think like most members of
Congress--am sick and tired of the blame game.
It is time then for solutions. One way or another, we are
going to get some clarity. The American people deserve straight
answers and real solutions.
On that note, I want to remind each of our witnesses that
it is a crime under title 18, section 101 to provide false
testimony to Congress. I thank you all for coming.
[The prepared statement of Chairman Grassley appears in the
appendix.]
The Chairman. Senator Wyden?
OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. RON WYDEN,
A U.S. SENATOR FROM OREGON
Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
And I just want to note, at the outset, our focus on
bipartisanship. We began that with our effort to go after price
gouging with hepatitis C. Recently we have gone after
manufacturers ripping off Medicaid. You noted our investigation
to look at insulin prices that just soar and soar and soar some
more. So I just very much appreciate the fact that we are
tackling this in a bipartisan way.
Colleagues, prescription drugs did not become outrageously
expensive by accident. It is not the result of a system too
complicated for Americans to understand. Drug prices are
astronomically high because that is where pharmaceutical
companies and their investors want them. The brakes have come
off pharmaceutical pricing, and American families are hurtling
along in the passenger seat terrified about what comes next.
Today the committee is going to hear about uplifting
stories and miracle cures. Yet it is morally repugnant when
patients cannot afford those miracles. It is morally repugnant
when ailing patients are forced to choose between filling the
next prescription or putting food on the table because they
cannot afford both. It is morally repugnant when patients are
forced to skip doses.
Pharma executives, all of you who are here today, are here
because the way you have been doing business is unacceptable.
Ten companies accounted for half of all the profits in the
health-care sector last year. Nine of them were drug
manufacturers. All but one of today's witnesses represent
companies on this list.
Drugmakers behave as if the patients and the taxpayers are
unlocked ATMs full of cash to be extracted, and their
shareholders are the customers whom they value above anybody
else. So I am going to go through a short list of examples
starting with AbbVie, which manufactures the top-selling
prescription drug in America, the arthritis medication Humira.
Over 6 years, the company doubled the price of a 12-month
supply from $19,000 to $38,000. Can the patients opt for a less
expensive alternative? They cannot, because AbbVie protects the
exclusivity of Humira like Gollum with his ring--thick cobwebs
of patents and legal tricks and shadowy deals with other
drugmakers. All of them are in place to keep the cash flowing.
Now I also want to address some very troubling information
we just got from AbbVie's proxy statement. It is a document
every publicly traded company has to file with the SEC. Page 37
shows that in 2017, a portion of CEO Richard Gonzalez's multi-
million-dollar bonus was directly tied to sales of Humira. It
appears the same incentive was in place in 2015 and 2016. In
fact, the committee's review shows that all of AbbVie's top
executives have the same arrangement.
Mr. Gonzalez is welcome to respond, but the implication
ought to be clear. From top down, AbbVie's leadership had
reason to keep pushing prices and sales up.
Now Pfizer, that company gets first prize for the emptiest
pricing gesture in 2018. After stern Trump tweets, Pfizer said
it would temporarily freeze the prices. But once the President
got his flashy headlines, his gaze went elsewhere. Pfizer's
former CEO told investors it was back to normal, another round
of price hikes in 2019, including the pain medication Lyrica.
Lyrica has increased 163 percent in price since 2012. Just one
drug allowed Pfizer to pull in $4.5 billion in 2017.
Merck gets second prize for emptiest pricing gesture of
2018. They made sweet-sounding promises after coming under
criticism, but they cut prices for drugs that essentially
produce no revenue for the company. Left untouched were the
cash cows Keytruda and Januvia, which account for more than a
quarter of the company's revenue. It is like promising car
shoppers a great deal, except the only discounted model on the
lot is an Edsel.
Sanofi--this is a company wringing more and more cash out
of people with an incurable disease. In 2010, a vial of this
insulin cost less than $100. In 2018, it cost nearly $300. The
company raised prices again in 2019. Considering the landmark
breakthrough on insulin came early in the roaring 20s, nothing
could justify this sudden price hike a century later. Diabetics
who cannot afford the cost now self-ration and endanger their
lives. But you know what? Investors are happy.
AstraZeneca--a lesson in saying the quiet part out loud. In
an interview earlier, the CEO complained that his $12-million
salary made him the lowest-paid CEO in the whole industry, and
he said it was annoying to some extent. His company, meanwhile,
continues to raise the price of Symbicort, its $3-billion
asthma drug. For some asthmatics, being able to breathe costs
hundreds of dollars a month.
And Johnson & Johnson gets the record today for flip-
flopping. This January 7th at the JP Morgan Health Conference,
the CEO said the pharmaceutical industry needs self-policing on
prices. That sounded good, but 3 days later the company hiked
the prices of hundreds of its drugs, including drugs that
account for billions in Medicare spending.
And finally, there is Bristol-Myers Squibb. In 2017, the
company spent roughly $11 billion on dividends, stock buybacks,
marketing, sales, and administrative costs that roughly triple
the amount spent on R&D.
Now I am going to close by saying that I want us to compare
these concrete examples of two-faced scheming and profiteering
with the central arguments that we are going to get this
morning. The central argument from pharma is basically, the
fault is always somebody else's. The health plans are at fault,
the pharmaceutical benefit managers are at fault, regulators
are at fault. What we know for certain is the history that
pharma CEOs always say somebody else is at fault.
We are also going to hear that the list price does not
matter, that the true costs are just so complicated. But
companies do not set and raise list prices for fun. Those
prices are directly tied to the amount patients pay out-of-
pocket at pharmacy windows from sea to shining sea. They are
directly tied to what taxpayers spend on health-care programs.
Then drugmakers point the finger at middlemen, the pharmacy
benefit managers. I have said for years these pharmacy managers
are wasteful and secretive, and take their cut without proving
their worth to anybody. They are going to have their day before
the committee too. But those pharmacy managers do not set list
prices. The manufacturers do.
And by the way, the manufacturers do not offer rebates for
nearly 40 percent of Part D brand-name drugs. Those prices are
going up. That is on the drug companies, not on the pharmacy
managers.
We are also going to hear that any changes in business as
usual hurt research and development. A quick look at company
finances shows that that is a fable. Revenue generated from
American patients alone dwarfs what they spend on R&D
worldwide.
Drugmakers spend as much, if not more, on those
exhilarating TV ads and office-to-office salesmen as they spend
on research and development. And if lower prices would diminish
R&D, why don't costly dividends? Why don't stock buybacks? Is
the stock price more important than inventing that next miracle
cure? Even if you buy the specious argument that a drug's list
price at launch is driven by research costs, what could justify
arbitrary price increases year after year, long after the
research and development spending is done?
Finally, we are going to hear about how patients can get
coupons. But if this was so generous, why can't drug companies
just lower prices across the board? I believe it is just more
slick branding, branding that allows companies to keep the
status quo cash cow rolling along.
I will close with this. I was there when seven big tobacco
CEOs testified in a committee room just like this one. They
lied that day. This committee, the chairman and I, expect
better than that this morning.
Your profits are outsized compared to others in the
industry. You get a massive portion of your revenue from
American taxpayers, and you bear none of the consequences of
these skyrocketing prices. It is long past time to drop the
excuses and take concrete action to make medicine in America
more affordable.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[The prepared statement of Senator Wyden appears in the
appendix.]
The Chairman. Now I will introduce our seven witnesses, but
once again, thank you for participating in this very important
hearing on a very important topic. We are grateful for your
participation and cooperation with our committee.
The first witness is Richard Gonzalez, chairman and chief
executive officer of AbbVie, Incorporated. Then we will hear
from Pascal Soriot, DVM, executive director and chief executive
officer of AstraZeneca. Then we will hear from Giovanni
Caforio, M.D., chairman of the board and chief executive
officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb; then Jennifer Taubert, executive
vice president and worldwide chairman of pharmaceuticals for
Johnson & Johnson; Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and chief
executive officer of Merck and Company; Albert Bourla, DVM,
Ph.D., chief executive officer of Pfizer; and Dr. Olivier
Brandicourt, M.D., chief executive officer of Sanofi.
We welcome all of you, and we will start in that direction.
And you have been given 5 minutes. I do not gavel you down at
the end of 5 minutes, but I wish when the red light would come
on, you would start to summarize, if you have not finished.
So we will start with Mr. Gonzalez.
STATEMENT OF RICHARD A. GONZALEZ, CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, ABBVIE INC., NORTH CHICAGO, IL
Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you, Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member
Wyden, and members of the committee.
I am Richard Gonzalez, and I am the chief executive officer
of AbbVie, a company dedicated to developing new innovative
medicines for some of health care's most challenging diseases,
such as cancer, Alzheimer's, viral infections, and autoimmune
diseases.
Since our inception in 2013, AbbVie has invested
approximately $50 billion in pursuit of that goal. However,
because we were tackling some of medicine's most challenging
problems, solutions do not come easily, nor without significant
risks.
Where we have succeeded, we have been able to provide cures
for fatal diseases like hepatitis C and significantly alter the
disease progression for certain cancers, lessening the burden
of illness on patients and on the health-care system. This is
what the 30,000 employees of AbbVie are dedicated to doing.
We agree that access to life-saving medicines is a critical
issue, and we look forward to sharing our perspectives with
you. There is no one solution to this complex issue, but AbbVie
is committed to working with the committee and others on how we
can better partner in your efforts to address pharmaceutical
pricing and access. AbbVie and the rest of our industry must
play a role in solving these issues and be prepared to work
together with the insurance industry, the administration, and
you to find a better path for American patients.
My remarks today will focus on one aspect of this inquiry,
the Medicare Part D benefit design, which, even after
pharmaceutical list prices are lowered, still contributes to
making innovative therapies cost-prohibitive for many Medicare
patients.
In general, the Medicare Part D program has worked well.
Its market-based structure and utilization of formularies
encourages competitive price discounts that have yielded
significant savings to the government since the Part D benefit
went into place back in 2006. However, despite these cost
savings, Part D patient out-of-pocket costs have significantly
increased. Some would blame that solely on high drug prices,
and we agree that price should be part of the discussion. But
it is also important to acknowledge that science has enabled us
to advance the standard of care far beyond what was possible
when the Part D benefit was originally designed.
Many of today's specialty medicines offer significant
advancements in treating or curing serious chronic or life-
threatening conditions and save significant amounts of money
for the health-care system by decreasing overall health-care
costs. Yet these therapies are also costly.
Due to the structure of the Part D benefit design, patients
are charged out-of-pocket costs on a medicine's list price,
which does not reflect the market-based rebates or discounts
that Medicare receives. We are encouraged by the proposed rule
that would reflect manufacturer's discounts in patient's Part D
out-of-pocket payments. This is an important step in the right
direction, but we believe more must still be done to help Part
D patients.
Let me give you a recent real-world example that
demonstrates the challenge with the current Part D benefit
design, and why the focus solely on list price does not fully
address the access challenges. An uninsured hepatitis C
infection leads to downstream medical costs for surgery,
chemotherapy, and radiation for patients who progress to
needing a liver transplant or having liver cancer. Today we can
cure hepatitis C with drugs. This cure is highly cost-effective
for the overall health-care system.
In 2017, AbbVie launched Mavyret, a highly effective cure
for HCV. At the time, the list prices for the competitive
alternatives were as high as $94,500 for the most commonly
prescribed treatment duration. We launched Mavyret at a list
price that was 72 percent lower. But even though we cut the
list price of an HCV cure--for most patients by 72 percent--
Medicare Part D patients' out-of-pocket obligations are still
too high for many patients to access this medicine.
We believe it is important that discussions about access
and affordability include a focus on how to alleviate Medicare
Part D out-of-pocket burdens above and beyond just lowering
list price. We are prepared to step up and discuss how
companies like ours can shoulder more of the burden of the
patient out-of-pocket expense as we do in other areas.
We believe AbbVie, the rest of the pharmaceutical industry,
and the insurance providers should come together with the
administration and you to work towards solutions that make
life-changing medicines more affordable to Part D patients. I
can assure you AbbVie is committed to doing its part, and we
look forward to working with you.
Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Gonzalez appears in the
appendix.]
The Chairman. Mr. Soriot?
STATEMENT OF PASCAL SORIOT, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,
ASTRAZENECA, WILMINGTON, DE
Mr. Soriot. Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden, and
members of the committee, good morning. I appreciate the
invitation to address concerns regarding the pricing of
medicines in the United States.
My name is Pascal Soriot, and I am the CEO of AstraZeneca.
Our company is dedicated to science and innovation. And in
2018, we invested nearly $6 billion in research and
development, 28 percent of our product sales, which is well
above the industry average.
In the past 2 years, our commitment to R&D has resulted in
18 significant FDA approvals and 5 breakthrough designations.
However, I know that these statistics are meaningless unless
patients can actually afford our medicines and those medicines
reduce overall health-care costs.
I am here to discuss how we can work with other
stakeholders to take specific actions that address pricing
concerns. My first proposal is that we move away from the
current rebate system while continuing to work with payers and
PBMs to ensure robust negotiations.
The current system is built on high list prices coupled
with rebates. This is not sustainable, and all of us have a
role to play. For example, the estimates for 2018 show that
across our medicines, our average rebate is nearly 50 percent
of our gross revenues in the U.S. Despite this, in recent years
in our primary care portfolio, we have seen flat to declining
net effective prices for most of our medicines. As a company
dependent upon government action for eliminating rebates in
commercial and in Part D, we are prepared to reduce our list
prices by an equivalent amount of rebates, less the appropriate
market-based fees, to those in the supply chain. This will
actually reduce overall costs not only for patients, but also
for the government.
My second proposal is that if a change of the current
system is not possible, a portion of discounts and rebates
could be used to create out-of-pocket caps for Medicare
patients. This approach is used successfully in some other
countries. Actually, it gives patients greater certainty in
their out-of-pocket cost.
Third, I believe that value-based agreements have the
potential to transform how medicines are priced and reimbursed
in the U.S. In our own value-based agreements, the price of a
medicine is directly linked to the value it provides to
patients, to payers, and to the health-care system.
For example, last month we announced an agreement for
University of Pittsburgh Medical Center Medicare patients who
are prescribed Brilinta. This innovative contract directly
reduces the cost for patients, and it ties price to clinical
value, basing our payments on patient outcome. These types of
agreements can be especially effective for medicines where
there is limited competition. As an example, for one of our
oral oncology medicines we agreed to reimburse a large payer
for discontinued use because patients did not respond to
treatment. And we have reimbursed the payer under those
agreements 20 percent of the time.
To that end, I appreciate the support of Senator Warner and
Senator Cassidy for value-based agreements, as demonstrated by
their request for input on the Patient Affordability, Value,
and Efficiency, the PAVE Act.
My fourth proposal is that we must encourage biosimilars
and eliminate policy and commercial barriers to their greater
use. Biologics are actually making very important contributions
to medicine, and I believe a vigorous biosimilar market would
reduce costs like generics do for small molecules. In fact,
biosimilars have gained up to 85 percent market share in the 5
largest countries in Europe, and the average biosimilar
discount is between 40 and 80 percent.
In closing, I would like to emphasize my strong commitment
to addressing the concerns raised by the committee. I believe
that we can work together to find solutions that continue to
allow manufacturers to innovate, while creating a more
efficient and more affordable system.
There are no easy answers, it is very clear, but we want to
be a constructive partner. Thank you, and I look forward to the
discussion.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Soriot appears in the
appendix.]
The Chairman. Dr. Caforio?
STATEMENT OF GIOVANNI CAFORIO, M.D., CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD AND
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BRISTOL-MEYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, NEW
YORK, NY
Dr. Caforio. Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden, and
members of the committee, good morning, and thank you for the
opportunity to be here today on behalf of the 24,000 employees
of Bristol-Myers Squibb. I look forward to working together to
align incentives to ensure all Americans have access to the
medicines they need.
I am a physician. I joined the pharmaceutical industry 30
years ago because of the impact companies like ours have on
patients.
We should all be proud that American companies lead our
industry. Our researchers have contributed to the development
of medicines that have reduced mortality from cardiovascular
disease, helped transform HIV/AIDS into a chronic disease, and
are now making significant progress with the treatment of
cancer.
Just 10 years ago, the idea of harnessing the immune system
to treat cancer was viewed with great skepticism. But our
researchers saw the promise of that approach and ignited an era
of scientific innovation that has changed survival expectations
in multiple tumors. Prior to the availability of immuno-
oncology treatments, only 25 percent of patients diagnosed with
metastatic melanoma were alive after 1 year. Today, thanks to
immuno-oncology therapies, that number has increased to 74
percent.
The potential of this approach has also been seen in lung
cancer, kidney cancer, and many other difficult-to-treat
tumors. These patients now have a chance for quality and long-
term survival.
But not all patients respond to current immunotherapies.
And so we must do more. We recently opened a new facility
dedicated to investigating what we call immuno-oncology
resistance. And we continuously seek external innovation to
augment our pipeline. In fact, in this context, we recently
announced our plans to acquire Celgene. Our goal is to bring
together the drive and dedication of two science-driven
companies to do even more for patients.
As a physician, I do recognize that medicines are only
helpful if patients and health-care systems can afford them. We
share the committee's concern with escalating health-care costs
and believe that our responsibility extends to ensuring that
patients have access to and can afford our medicines. For this
reason, the average net pricing across our U.S. portfolio of
medicines increased by 5 percent or less year-over-year for the
last 5 years. Importantly, it did not increase at all in 2018.
And we expect that it will not increase in 2019.
Despite this fact, we do recognize that patients' out-of-
pocket costs continue to increase. We believe it is possible to
work together to realign incentives to ensure patients can
afford medicines without stifling scientific innovation. So
what are the solutions? We are supportive of the proposed rule
aimed at reforming the rebate system with a focus on what is
best for patients.
We need to ensure more generics are available whenever
permissible under our system. We support value-based purchasing
arrangements that tie payments to value. These models can
reduce costs, improve access and patient adherence, and
contribute to better outcomes.
We applaud efforts by Health and Human Services and this
committee in all of these areas. We do believe the U.S. should
not adopt policies that stifle innovation in other countries.
Outside of the U.S., reimbursement of new medicines often takes
more than 2 years. For example, nearly 4 years ago our Opdivo
and Yervoy regimen was first approved to treat metastatic
melanoma in the U.S. Today, 6 of the 16 countries included in
the international price index proposal still do not provide
reimbursement for this combination, which is the standard of
care for the treatment of this cancer. This is why we do not
support the proposed international price index model for
Medicare Part B drugs.
I would like to leave you with a few thoughts. First, we
recognize the need for change. We are witnessing a historic era
in biomedical innovation. American research-based companies are
leading the way to help patients whose diseases cannot be
adequately treated with today's medicines. But we must ensure
that patients have affordable access to new innovations. And we
should work on policies that support and reward access and
these investments. I look forward to working together to
implement real change that broadens access to innovative
medicines for patients.
In closing, on behalf of my colleagues at Bristol-Myers
Squibb and the patients we serve, my sincere thanks for your
time and attention today.
The Chairman. Thank you very much.

The Chairman. Now, Ms. Taubert?
STATEMENT OF JENNIFER TAUBERT, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT,
WORLDWIDE CHAIRMAN, JANSSEN PHARMACEUTICALS, JOHNSON & JOHNSON,
NEW BRUNSWICK, NJ
Ms. Taubert. Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden,
members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to be
here today. I am Jennifer Taubert, and I lead the Janssen
Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson. We focus on
discovering and developing transformational medicines for some
of the world's most challenging diseases, including multiple
myeloma, prostate cancer, HIV, schizophrenia, and Crohn's
disease, among others.
Like many of you, I know what it is like when a loved one
faces serious illness. My own mother died of lung cancer while
in her 40s, and at that time there was very little that could
be done for her. I have committed my career to bringing
families hope: hope for years of life, for the chance to be
there for a daughter's wedding or for a grandson's birth.
Janssen invested $8.4 billion in research and development
last year in the search for medical breakthroughs, making us
one of the world's top R&D investors in any industry. In fact,
our investment in R&D last year was 86 percent more than we
spent on sales and marketing. And this substantial investment
is changing lives. It has helped turn HIV from a death sentence
to a manageable disease. Our targeted cancer medicines have
helped patients with some of the most deadly cancers live
longer, in some cases for many years.
Medicines not only help patients and families. They also
help lower overall health-care costs by keeping people well,
preventing the need for expensive procedures and
hospitalizations. But medicines cannot make a difference if the
patients who need them cannot afford them. We understand the
concerns about the cost of health care.
Our approach recognizes our responsibility to patients
today and patients tomorrow. Patients today need access to our
medicines. Patients tomorrow count on us to deliver cures and
treatments for the most challenging diseases. When we price our
medicines, we balance the value to patients, the importance of
affordable access, and the importance of developing future
breakthroughs. The list price is a starting point that is
reduced by required discounts to government programs and
rebates to payers so they will grant patients access to our
medicines.
Last year our discounts and rebates amounted to $21 billion
and our net price decreased 6.8 percent. Unfortunately, while
our overall price decreased for the past 2 years, patients have
seen their out-of-pocket costs go up. One reason is increased
enrollment in health plans that require patients to pay more
for their prescriptions. As one recent analysis shows, patients
are required to pay 13 percent of overall pharmaceutical costs,
versus only 3 percent of hospital costs, even though medicine
can help keep patients out of the hospital.
Above all, we need an American solution to this American
challenge. We must ensure that today's medicines are
affordable, while at the same time preserving the innovation
that has delivered so much and promises even more. We must
maintain the hallmarks that make American health care
remarkable: access to innovative therapies, personal choice,
and doctors and patients making decisions based on what is
right for each individual.
At Janssen, we are committed to being a part of the
solution. We believe open dialogue is essential. That is why in
2016, we began issuing the Janssen Transparency Report, sharing
information about how we invest our resources, price our
medicines, and help people access them. And we recently
announced our plan to include list price and potential patient
out-of-pocket costs in our direct-to-consumer TV advertising.
In the same spirit of open dialogue, we have consistently
brought forward ideas and perspectives to both Congress and the
administration to fix what is not working while preserving what
is.
We have included more details in our submitted testimony,
but I want to touch on a few points today. First, while
Medicare Part D is working for many seniors and has been
effective in containing costs, we believe an out-of-pocket cap
is a needed protection.
Second, in Medicare Part B, we have proposed options that
would allow Medicare to continue to achieve negotiated savings
through market competition while reducing costs.
And third, we support rebate reforms that ensure patients
benefit from the negotiated rebates and discounts--$150 billion
in total in 2017 alone--and as a result, have patients see
lower out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy.
We are on the verge of extraordinary progress that could
change our lives and the lives of our children and
grandchildren. At Janssen, we are committed to bringing that
promise to life.
Thank you very much.
The Chairman. Thank you.

The Chairman. Mr. Frazier?
STATEMENT OF KENNETH C. FRAZIER, CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, MERCK AND COMPANY, INC., KENILWORTH, NJ
Mr. Frazier. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Wyden, and
members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to
appear here today.
Merck's mission is to save and improve lives around the
world by bringing forward breakthrough medicines and vaccines.
Research is at the core of Merck. Last year we invested $10
billion in R&D, 23 percent of product sales. And we have
invested nearly $70 billion over the past decade.
Over the last 5 years, we have also made capital
investments of over $5 billion in the United States, and we
plan to invest more than $9 billion more over the next few
years to increase manufacturing capacity and to open two new
research centers in the United States.
We go where the science leads us, which means we do not
focus only on diseases in wealthier countries. For example, we
are proud to have deployed 70,000 doses of our experimental
Ebola vaccine in the Congo, working in partnership with the
United States government. The goal is to save lives even where
no viable commercial opportunity exists. We do all this to
serve patients.
We fully understand that U.S. patients are having a harder
and harder time affording the medicines they need. While
medicine costs are growing at the slowest rate in years, our
patients are too often being asked to pay more out of pocket. I
am here to suggest some ways that together we can address this
problem. First, we want to be clear that our industry has a
duty to be responsible in our pricing practices and to
contribute to solutions that address patient affordability.
Merck has a history of responsible pricing. We publish
information about our prices, and the rebates and discounts we
provide to payers. Last year we pledged that we will not
increase our average net prices across our portfolio by more
than the rate of inflation annually
Second, we must ensure that patients get the benefit of
these large rebates and discounts. The incentives in the
current system are badly misaligned with the growing gap
between list and net prices, creating incentives to favor
products with higher list prices. This misalignment hurts
patients because their cost sharing is often based on the list
price of a drug. We urge you to support action to ensure that
patients benefit from these discounts.
Third, we can significantly reduce drug spending for
patients in the health-care system by ensuring that we have a
viable biosimilars market in the United States. We urge
Congress to encourage and support greater biosimilar
utilization.
Fourth, we believe that prices can better align with a
drug's value, when manufacturers and payers are able to
negotiate innovative contracts that base payment on a drug's
benefit. We need to move to this type of system, but there
remain major regulatory and operational obstacles to such
value-based arrangements, which we urge Congress to address. We
agree that manufacturers should be rewarded based on the value
that our therapies deliver.
Fifth, we support efforts to encourage generic competition.
A version of Chairman Grassley's CREATES Act and similar
policies could make needed reforms to encourage generic
competition and ensure there is no inappropriate gaming of the
system. We also support eliminating coupons in cases where
brand name generic competition exists.
Finally, we would like to work with the committee to find
ways to end price gouging by some who excessively increase off-
patent drug prices where there is no competition. These high
prices hurt patients, and they do not create incentives for
research. These changes could bring real relief to today's
patients while preserving the incentives to invest in
tomorrow's breakthroughs. Decades of research investment are
now yielding life-changing discoveries. If we damage the
biomedical ecosystem that thrives on these investments, we will
surely limit what can be achieved for patients and society.
The single most important thing we do at Merck is to
persist in making large and risky investments in R&D that allow
our thousands of researchers to sit at their lab benches to try
to create something transformative despite the overwhelming
odds that their efforts will not succeed, since more than 9 out
of 10 compounds fail.
I would like to end on a brief personal note. My mother
died when I was a child, and my siblings and I were raised by
my father. He was a giant in my life, and I was devastated when
Alzheimer's took him away from us.
Last year, after spending many years and over $1 billion,
Merck had to end development of a promising Alzheimer's therapy
because it did not work. Yet we continue on, seeking better
approaches, and I truly believe that Merck or one of the other
companies at this table will find a medicine that will avoid
the pain of seeing a loved one taken away from them in this
way.
This vital work depends on having a U.S. market that is
free, competitive, and predictable. We must work together to
solve the affordability challenges of today's patients without
jeopardizing the hopes of those waiting for tomorrow's cures.
The changes I have discussed today have the potential to vastly
improve the market while lessening the financial hardships many
people face.
I am here to pledge Merck's cooperation with you in
creating such changes. Thank you very much.
The Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Frazier.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Frazier appears in the
appendix.]
The Chairman. Now, Dr. Bourla?
STATEMENT OF ALBERT BOURLA, DVM, Ph.D.,
CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PFIZER, NEW YORK, NY
Dr. Bourla. Good morning. Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member
Wyden, and members of the committee, thank you for the
invitation. My name is Albert Bourla. I have been with Pfizer
26 years and just last month became its chief executive
officer.
I have to say that today I am particularly humbled to take
part in such an important policy discussion within the United
States Senate. When I immigrated into the United States 18
years ago, I could never have imagined such an honor.
In that frightening moment when you hear that you or a
loved one has been diagnosed with a serious disease, one
question comes to mind: is there a treatment available? The
answer to this question will change your life. Happily the
answer, increasingly, is ``yes.''
New breakthroughs are coming quickly to treat many
difficult and devastating diseases. But these breakthroughs
will not do anyone any good if patients cannot afford them. And
unfortunately, the horribly misaligned incentives within our
health-care system often make medicines unaffordable for
American patients. We need to fix this. Today, we would like to
propose four ideas to drive meaningful savings for patients.
The first idea is passing all rebates to patients. Pfizer
supports a system in which transparent up-front discounts
directly benefit patients, rather than the system where rebates
are swallowed up by the supply chain. In the current system,
for example, none of the approximately $12 billion that Pfizer
paid in rebates, in 2018, found its way to American patients.
If the proposed rule to share rebates with consumers at the
point of sale is finalized, we estimate that seniors taking
Pfizer medicines could save hundreds of dollars a year, on
average.
The second idea is less volume, less pay. Imagine a system
where Pfizer gets paid based on the number of heart attacks we
prevent, rather than on the number of pills we sell. In such a
system, if our medicines do not produce good results, we should
be paid less. And if they do, we should be paid more.
Such value-based payment arrangements, if done correctly,
can align the interests of patients, insurance companies, and
biopharmaceutical companies around one shared goal, ensuring
positive health outcomes for patients. I understand that
several members of this committee are working on legislation to
pave the way for these types of arrangements. And we applaud
this effort.
The third idea is around capping seniors' out-of-pocket
medicine costs. Patients are increasingly being required to
take on a disproportionately higher share of their medicines'
costs. Today patients pay on average 14 percent of the cost of
their medicines, but they pay only 3 percent of the cost
associated with hospital stays, for example. This is forcing
patients to forego taking needed medications or to limit their
doses. This is bad, not only for patients, but also for overall
system costs. Patients who do not take their medicines often
end up in the hospital, costing much more to the system. An
important first step is capping out-of-pocket costs seniors
experience in the medical drug program.
And the fourth idea is to knock down barriers to lower-cost
biosimilars. Others have spoken about it. Adverse incentives
that favor higher-cost biologics are keeping biosimilars from
reaching patients. In many cases, insurance companies declined
to include lower-cost biosimilars in their formularies because
they would risk losing the rebates from covering higher-cost
medicines. I cannot think of a more concerning example of a
broken system, and we need to do something about it.
In closing, Pfizer is all about breakthroughs that change
patients' lives. This is why our more than 90,000 colleagues,
many of whom work in laboratories and manufacturing plants in
States represented by members of this committee, come to work
every day. And it is why we are here today, to work with you
and all stakeholders to find ways to ensure that we can
continue to discover medicines that can change patients' lives.
The Chairman. Thank you.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Bourla appears in the
appendix.]
The Chairman. Now to Dr. Brandicourt.
STATEMENT OF OLIVIER BRANDICOURT, M.D., CHIEF EXECUTIVE
OFFICER, SANOFI, BRIDGEWATER, NJ
Dr. Brandicourt. Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden,
and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to
appear before the Senate Committee on Finance to discuss
pharmaceutical pricing, affordability, and patient access. I am
Olivier Brandicourt, the chief executive officer of Sanofi. I
understand the anger about rising out-of-pocket costs for many
medicines, including insulins.
I appreciate the confusion as to why patient costs continue
to rise, even when the amount that PBMs and health plans pay
declines. This situation is unacceptable and unsustainable for
too many patients. My goal today is to have an honest
discussion about how the system works, and how it can be
improved. As you may know, 2 years ago Sanofi announced our
progressive and industry-leading principles.
First, we made a pledge to keep price increases at or below
the U.S. national health expenditure projected growth rates.
Second, we committed to providing a clear rationale for pricing
when we launch new medicines. And third, we have increased
transparency by providing each year information about our list
and net prices across all of our medicines.
In 2018, the average aggregate least-price increase across
all Sanofi medicines in the U.S. was 4.6 percent, while the
average aggregate net price--that is the price actually paid to
Sanofi--declined by 8 percent. So declining average aggregate
net price in 2018 represents a third consecutive year in which
the amount paid by payers across all of our medicines went
down.
I feel a special obligation to address the pressing issues
around access and affordability of our insulins. Insulin is a
clear example of the growing gap between list and net prices.
Since 2012, the net price of Sanofi insulins has declined 25
percent. Yet patient out-of-pocket costs have continued to
rise. If you take Lantus, for instance, our most prescribed
insulin, the net price has fallen by 30 percent since 2012. Yet
over the same period, average out-of-pocket costs have risen
approximately 60 percent for patients with commercial insurance
and Medicare. It is my belief that declining net prices should
result in lower out-of-pocket costs for patients. But clearly,
this is not always the case.
Addressing these prices alone will not be sufficient to
solve the problem of patients' out-of-pocket costs. As we look
for solutions, we must have protections for patients and link
responsible pricing to both access and affordability. Every
actor in the system has a role to play, and Sanofi takes this
call to action seriously. There are different ways to
accomplish these goals, and Sanofi could support options that
align to our core principles. First, changes to the drug
pricing and reimbursement system must be holistic, factoring in
all actors in the system. And the majority of benefits should
accrue to patients.
And second, to maintain a strong environment for innovation
in the United States, the government should not directly
control the price of medicines, either through Federal
Government price controls, or worse, outsourcing price
decisions to other countries.
To ensure that responsible pricing translates to better
access and affordability for patients, Sanofi supports the
policy solutions outlined in my written testimony, including
several policies introduced by members of this committee, such
as the CREATES Act, the C-THRU Act, and the SPIKE Act.
So thank you for the invitation to speak with you today,
and I look forward to answering your questions.
The Chairman. I thank all of you for your testimony.
[The prepared statement of Dr. Brandicourt appears in the
appendix.]
The Chairman. And I think I heard from each of you that you
are willing to work with us and people in the administration to
find solutions to these problems. I welcome that sort of
cooperation and just implore you that that cooperation will
have to go on weeks beyond this hearing, because we would not
expect to get all the information we need just at this hearing.
Now, we will go to questioning. Do not start my clock yet.
I have not asked my questions yet. [Laughter.]
Before I ask questions, if I could have--obviously, we have
a very important meeting here. We have seven witnesses. We have
24 or 25 members of this committee.
I think I am fairly liberal in letting people ask
questions. But I want to repeat something I have said before,
and that is that if you will take your 5 minutes, and if there
are a few seconds left, you ask a question then--hopefully, it
is a short question at that point, and hopefully there is a
short answer at that point.
What irritates me about that process is when somebody
thinks they can have back and forth for 3 or 4 minutes after
you ask your last question. So I am asking you, if you would
please be tolerant towards people who abide by the 5 minutes,
to be respectful of that so that everybody gets a chance to ask
questions.
Now my 5 minutes starts. [Laughter.]
I want to thank those of you who are here who said you
would be supportive of legislation that I have been backing for
a long period of time: CREATES, which is sponsored by Senator
Leahy and this Senator, and Pay-for-Delay by Senator Klobuchar
and this Senator. So those are bipartisan bills.
One other bipartisan bill that you probably do not know
about yet--it was introduced by Senator Wyden and me a couple
weeks ago--is called the Right Rebate Act, which would close a
loophole that was exploited by Mylan in the EpiPen case.
So leading to my questions, starting off, Ranking Member
Wyden and I have been working--before I became chairman of this
committee again, we investigated a lot about Gilead's pricing
decisions for hepatitis C drugs. During that investigation, we
acquired a document that listed some factors that Gilead
considered when it priced those drugs.
Those factors included the risk of ``public outcry'' or
``the likelihood of a letter from Congress'' or the
``likelihood of a congressional hearing.'' So taking off from
that point, here is a very simple question to answer, I think.
So I want a ``yes'' or ``no'' from each of you.
When your company prices its drugs, do you consider the
risk of negative public opinion in the pricing of that drug? We
will start with AbbVie.
Mr. Gonzalez. Senator----
The Chairman. Can you answer ``yes'' or ``no''?
Mr. Gonzalez. Yes, we do.
The Chairman. Yes, you do. Okay.
What about AstraZeneca?
Mr. Soriot. Yes, we do, Senator. Amongst other factors, of
course, but we do.
The Chairman. Okay.
What about Bristol-Myers?
Dr. Caforio. Yes, we do, Senator, among many factors.
The Chairman. Okay.
Johnson & Johnson?
Ms. Taubert. Yes, we do, Senator, as well as affordable
access to the medicines for the patients.
The Chairman. Okay.
What about Merck?
Mr. Frazier. Yes, we do, among other factors.
The Chairman. Okay.
And what about Pfizer?
Dr. Bourla. Yes, we do, among other factors.
The Chairman. And what about Sanofi?
Dr. Brandicourt. Yes, we do, among other factors.
The Chairman. Okay. Thank you.
Another ``yes'' or ``no'' question: when determining list
price, do you consider the likelihood of a congressional
inquiry? Let's start with AbbVie.
Mr. Gonzalez. No, we do not.
The Chairman. What about AstraZeneca?
Mr. Soriot. No, we do not, Senator.
The Chairman. What about Bristol-Myers?
Dr. Caforio. No, Senator, we do not.
The Chairman. And what about Johnson & Johnson?
Ms. Taubert. No, Senator, we do not.
The Chairman. Okay; and Merck?
Mr. Frazier. Not explicitly.
I would say we do care what the public thinks.
The Chairman. Okay.
And what about Pfizer?
Dr. Bourla. No, we do not think----
The Chairman. Okay. What about Sanofi?
Dr. Brandicourt. Same, Senator; we do not.
The Chairman. Okay.
Then I would have another ``yes'' or ``no'' question. When
your company prices its drugs, do you take into account the
fact that a key player is the Federal Government?
Let us start with AbbVie.
Mr. Gonzalez. We evaluate all the channels when we make
determinations on price and affordability.
The Chairman. Okay.
So that obviously would include the Federal Government.
Mr. Gonzalez. Correct.
The Chairman. AstraZeneca?
Mr. Soriot. Yes, we use the same approach, and of course
the Federal Government is a very key aspect of our
deliberations.
The Chairman. Okay.
Bristol-Myers?
Dr. Caforio. Yes, Senator, because the Federal Government
is a large part of our----
The Chairman. Okay.
Johnson & Johnson?
Ms. Taubert. Yes, we take into account the value to
patients, the health-care system, and society, and the
government is a key part of that.
The Chairman. Okay.
And Merck?
Mr. Frazier. Yes.
The Chairman. Okay.
And Pfizer?
Dr. Bourla. Absolutely.
The Chairman. And then Sanofi?
Dr. Brandicourt. Yes.
The Chairman. Okay.
My last question. ``Yes'' or ``no'': some of you have
voiced support for the recent rebate rule proposed by the
administration. Should the administration finalize this rule,
will you commit to lowering your drug prices?
Mr. Gonzalez. Mr. Chairman, we are supportive of the rule.
We would like to see it in its final form, obviously, to make a
final decision. But we are supportive of taking the discount to
the patient at the point of sale.
The Chairman. Okay.
AstraZeneca?
Mr. Soriot. The same for us, Senator. I would go one step
further: if the rebates were removed from the commercial sector
as well, we would definitely reduce our list prices.
The Chairman. Okay.
And Bristol-Myers?
Dr. Caforio. We have the same position, sir.
The Chairman. Okay.
And Johnson & Johnson?
Ms. Taubert. Yes, we are supportive, and that definitely
would be my goal. We would just need to see the final
legislation, provided that there are not additional fees that
are added into the system to compensate for the rebates.
The Chairman. Okay.
Merck?
Mr. Frazier. I would expect that our prices would go down
if we change the system, again, on the commercial side as well
as the Medicare side.
The Chairman. Okay.
Pfizer?
Dr. Bourla. It is our very clear intention that we will not
keep a single dollar from these rebates. We will try to move
every single penny to the patients. And we think if this goes
also to the commercial plans, that would be even better for
more patients.
The Chairman. Okay.
Sanofi?
Dr. Brandicourt. Lowering list price has to be linked to
better access and affordability at the counter for the
patients.
The Chairman. Okay.
I want fellow colleagues to know that I stopped at 5
minutes and 26 seconds.
Senator Wyden?
Senator Wyden. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Let me start, if I could, with you, Mr. Bourla, on this
list price question. And I want to see if we can do a couple of
``yes'' or ``no'' questions.
Is it correct that your company, and nobody else, sets the
starting price for all drugs sold by Pfizer? That is a ``yes''
or ``no.''
Dr. Bourla. It is a negotiation with PBMs, and they are
very powerful.
Senator Wyden. But you still get to set the list price?
Dr. Bourla. Yes, but we set----
Senator Wyden. Okay.
Dr. Bourla [continuing]. The list price and the rebates
based on----
Senator Wyden. Is it correct when a hypothetical patient--
let us call her Mrs. Jones--goes to pay for her drug at the
pharmacy counter, her coinsurance is based on the price of the
drug you set?
Dr. Bourla. It is correct in many cases.
Senator Wyden. Okay.
I just want you all to know that the number one reason
consumers are getting hammered is because these list prices--
and you have the last word with respect to where they are--are
unaffordable. And the high prices are tied to what the consumer
pays at the pharmacy counter. And all this other stuff you talk
about--the rebates and the discounts and the coupons--all this
other stuff is window dressing, all of it. And the fact is on
Part D, 40 percent of the drugs do not even have a rebate.
So I want it understood--particularly, because I have asked
you, Dr. Bourla--I think you and others in the industry are
stonewalling on the key issue, which is actually lowering list
prices. And reducing those list prices is the easiest way for
American consumers to pay less at the pharmacy counter.
Now, Mr. Gonzalez, I want to ask you some questions
relating to the international pricing situation. Drug prices
are much higher in the United States than in other developed
countries, on average 40 percent higher. In 2017, AbbVie made
$9.9 billion in revenue outside the United States.
So my first question to you is, do you make a profit on the
drugs that you sell in Germany or in France?
Mr. Gonzalez. Yes, we do.
Senator Wyden. So if you do, and you have said that that is
the case, if you can turn a profit in a country with
dramatically lower prices, you can do the same thing in the
United States. How is that not gouging the American consumer
with high prices, even though you are giving other people in
Western industrialized countries a better deal?
Mr. Gonzalez. Senator, it is a great question. And the
reality is--and I do not think it is just unique to AbbVie--
that prices vary dramatically around the world. There is no
question, at least in AbbVie's business for the most part, the
U.S. has some of the highest prices in the world.
That is not universally true. The government has some
relatively low prices in comparison. But I think the
fundamental issue is this: our system is built around a variety
of pricing around the world, but that overall system supports
our R&D model.
If a market the size of the United States were to collapse
to the lower end of that pricing model, then I can just tell
you AbbVie would not be able to invest the level of R&D that it
invests today. So that is the reality.
Senator Wyden. Well, I think time is short.
As I noted in my opening statement, global R&D spending is
far less than the revenue you make in America. American
patients bring in more than enough revenue to cover your R&D
costs.
I mean, I am going to have town meetings in a few days at
home, and people will say, ``Ron, this is ridiculous that we
are getting gouged when people around the world are getting a
better deal.'' And what you have told me today is: (a) they are
getting a better deal and you can make a profit; and (b) it is
somehow tied to research and development. And the fact is that
research and development is less than the revenue that you are
making in this country, and that is why people are so angry.
And I would also like to note that a Humira biosimilar was
launched in Europe last year, and due to AbbVie's anti-
competitive behavior in the United States, that same biosimilar
will not be available here until 2023. You have a double
standard. You are willing to sit by and hose the American
consumer and give the breaks to people overseas.
So I am going to wrap up and stick to the chairman's time
limit by asking you for a response in writing. So that we can
better understand the situation for the drugs you sell in other
countries, I would like to know, for the drugs you sell in
other Western industrialized countries--just the Western
industrialized countries--does your company make or lose money?
Can you get that to me in writing within 10 days?
Mr. Gonzalez. I can give it to you right now.
Senator Wyden. Okay.
Mr. Gonzalez. We make money in any country that we sell in
unless we choose to donate the product into those countries.
And we do that in certain countries that cannot afford it, but
not the Western----
Senator Wyden. I would like it in writing.
Mr. Gonzalez. Okay.
One thing I would like to point out that I do not think is
totally accurate that you described, at least for AbbVie, is we
spend $5.2 billion dollars in R&D. We make $5.6 billion dollars
in earnings.
So our R&D is almost equivalent to what our earnings are.
Senator Wyden. Well----
The Chairman. I am going to----
Senator Wyden. We will continue that.
The Chairman. I am going to list four names at a time.
Roberts will be next, and then Stabenow, and then Enzi, and
then Cantwell. So if you are irritated about how you might be
on this list, take it out with one of your colleagues on the
committee, because I am reading it just the way the staff gave
it to me.
So, Senator Roberts?
Senator Roberts. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will try to be
timely.
This whole situation reminds me of when Mark Twain, i.e.,
Samuel Clemens, went to Missouri--that was his first mistake--
and made some remarks to a small town. The mayor afterwards
said, ``Well now, we have the tar and the feathers and a rail.
We would like to ride you out of town on a rail.'' He said,
``If it was not for the honor of it, I'd just as soon not do
that.''
And I think in some ways that is where you are sitting
right now. I worry about the cost. I worry about the access. I
worry about the value. I worry about the fact that when I go--I
did just last night, and all of a sudden I found out that the
prescription I had cost twice as much. I still have not quite
figured that out. I do not know which one of you to blame.
But at any rate, I worry about HHS. I worry about CMS. I
worry about the Federal Government taking over with regards to
the decisions that you make. I also worry about what the
distinguished Senator from Oregon described as a terrified
public, and certainly we do not want any liars.
I want to ask you one simple question. Staff has arranged
about seven good questions. I will submit them for the record.
Under the banner of certainty and predictability, what
keeps you up at night? In other words, if in fact we invited
you back and you could come back--well, let me put it another
way. What would happen if you ran into some things that were
unprecedented and you would not be here? We would not have the
Magnificent Seven, if in fact that's why we won a ``W.''
What I want to know is, what is the thing that keeps you up
at night, so you could be a viable company now and down the
road to achieve what we all want in terms of access and cost?
And I am going to start with Dr. Brandicourt, because I want to
go from right to left for a change.
Dr. Brandicourt. Thank you, Senator. What keeps me up at
night is ensuring that I have a pipeline of new products which
is innovative enough to alleviate, you know, some of the
disease burdens in the countries where we are. So it is making
our company meaningful and delivering what we are supposed to
do best.
Senator Roberts. Thank you.
Dr. Bourla. Mr. Senator, the reason we exist is to bring
breakthroughs that change patients' lives. And this is what
keeps me up, and this is the reason why our employees come to
work. This is the reason why our investors invest in us.
If our pipeline will not deliver on the promise--and this
is very challenging, because you are dealing with very
difficult diseases to crack--then we will not be able to
fulfill our promise to society and will not be able to fulfill
our promise to investors.
Senator Roberts. Mr. Frazier, thank you for your five-point
plan. What say you?
Mr. Frazier. I would say, Senator, the thing that keeps me
most up at night is the concern that we will not have a viable,
predictable market that will allow people to continue to put
the very large amounts of money at risk for a long period of
time in an attempt to find solutions to some of the hardest
problems, like Alzheimer's, that have evaded solutions.
And what really concerns me is when we do not treat these
issues as systemic issues and the public thinks that they have
to have outrageous solutions to the problem where, in the
future, we will not get these drugs.
So I would hope that we could talk about these things
systemically and try to come up with the kinds of solutions
that will, in fact, make patients have access to medicines
today while allowing tomorrow's breakthroughs to happen. Thank
you.
Senator Roberts. Thank you.
Ms. Taubert?
Ms. Taubert. Senator, the easy diseases have largely been
solved. It gets harder and harder as we go after new treatments
and new cures for ever more challenging diseases.
So from our perspective, what keeps me up at night is that
investment in innovation and the ability to continue to invest
to be able to go after the cures and the diseases that we
really want to solve.
Senator Roberts. Thank you.
Dr. Caforio?
Dr. Caforio. Mr. Senator, I am a physician, as I said
earlier. What keeps me up at night is our patients who still do
not have an opportunity for their cancer to be treated. And as
a result of that, I am really focused on, first, continuing to
invest in R&D together with the 7,000 scientists at Bristol-
Myers Squibb, and also making sure that every patient who needs
one of our medicines has access to it.
Senator Roberts. Mr. Soriot?
Mr. Soriot. Senator, two things, actually. One is making
sure we have the best science, the best scientists, and an
environment that stimulates their innovation. The second is
really to come up with ways to demonstrate the value of our
products. I believe that medicines are actually part of the
solution, not part of the problem. And it is sad that we are
talking about those difficulties patients are facing.
In the last 15 years, the mortality for cardiovascular
disease has declined by 35 percent. Most of this is due to good
treatments for hypertension, cholesterol. And in fact, it is
cost-effective. We keep patients out of the hospital.
So the one thing that really keeps me up at night is, how
do we demonstrate the value we bring, and how do we reduce
overall health-care costs?
Senator Roberts. Mr. Gonzalez, I am out of time.
The Chairman. No, he can answer. You asked your question.
Go ahead.
Senator Roberts. Thank you for being so liberal.
[Laughter.]
Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you, Senator.
There are two things that keep me up at night. The first is
we, like many around this table, are working on some of the
toughest diseases that are out there, which takes on tremendous
amount of risk--I am sure you heard that many, many times.
But the reality is, when we work on these diseases, like
Alzheimer's as an example, when someone comes up with a
beneficial treatment for Alzheimer's, it is going to change the
lives of patients, families, and it is going to reduce
dramatically health-care costs. But not necessarily the cost of
medicine.
The cost of medicine is going to go up. The cost of nursing
homes is going to go down. And systems have a very difficult
time trying to measure that benefit, but the reality is, when
you are working in these areas with these kind of intractable
diseases, that is the ultimate payback that the system has to
be able to evaluate.
Senator Roberts. Thank you.
The Chairman. Senator Stabenow?
Senator Stabenow. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and
Ranking Member.
Thank you for being here. I will tell you what keeps people
in Michigan up late at night. It is the cost of life-saving
medicine for themselves, their children, their parents. And so
that is why it is important that we are here, and I am glad we
are talking about research, because I would like to step back a
moment and talk about who basically is funding research, and I
hope you will say ``thank you'' to the American taxpayer,
because American families fund the National Institutes of
Health.
A recent report found that NIH-funded research contributed
to every single one of the 210 new drugs approved by the FDA
from 2010 to 2016, and that American taxpayers contributed more
than $200 billion in grants--$200 billion in grants to your
companies and others. Grants, not loans; grants to develop
these drugs.
That is about 200,000 years of accumulated research. And I
support that, because the basic research is something that I
believe we all need to share in. At the same time, when you
then go from there and are doing R&D, you can write that off
your taxes, so American taxpayers subsidize you again.
Now, according to the most recent SEC filings, the seven
companies--all of you here today--have spent about $80 billion
on selling, marketing, and administrative expenses last year,
which was $22 billion more than you spent on R&D.
So let us just be clear on this: American taxpayers, we are
happy to help you be able to develop these drugs, but I can
tell you, people in Michigan just feel that the bargain ought
to be that they ought to be able to afford the medicine after
they have helped to develop it.
Between 2006 and 2015, the largest 25 drug companies
enjoyed an average annual profit of between 15 and 20 percent.
Most other large Fortune 500 companies saw between 4 and 9
percent.
I know the auto industry would love to get the kind of
profits that you have. But the reality is that, if people do
not buy a car, they do not buy furniture, their life is not
threatened. If they cannot buy your product, it may be. So that
is why this is so important today.
And, Mr. Gonzales, I want to specifically start with you,
because Humira is the world's best-selling drug. It treats
arthritis, Crohn's disease as we know, also ulcerative colitis.
And you introduced the drug in 2003, and in 2017 it generated
$18.4 billion in revenue. And if Humira was its own company, it
would be among the Fortune 500 companies all by itself.
So let us talk about this, because the average person on
Medicare is earning $26,000 a year. The price of your drug
started high and has gone higher, to a point now where it is as
much as $50,000 a year.
So, Mr. Gonzales, your primary patent expired in the U.S.
in 2016. Is that correct?
Mr. Gonzalez. That is correct.
Senator Stabenow. And you have more than a hundred other
kinds of patents for processes and techniques and so on. In
fact, according to a report, ``Broad U.S. Humira Patent
Estate,'' some of the patents go up to 2034, which gives you
about 31 years of patent protection. That is a pretty good deal
on this successful drug.
When we look at what is happening around--well, let me
first ask this. Has the drug itself gotten any better with all
the new patents?
Mr. Gonzalez. I think as you look at the evolution of the
patent portfolio that is around Humira, it is important to keep
in perspective that that patent portfolio evolved as we
discovered and learned new things about Humira, in particular,
as we discovered that this particular molecule could be
utilized across a large number of different disease states.
Senator Stabenow. And I am going to, unfortunately, in the
interest of time--I appreciate that and would want to follow up
in writing, but as I understand it, the chemical formula is the
same. And so it is a question of how we use the patent system.
But to look at, in Europe, when your patents expired in the
fall of 2018 and biosimilars came out on the market, your
prices there were already lower than in the U.S., but now you
are offering, I understand, up to 80 percent discounts to be
able to continue to compete in Europe. Why do you not--with all
of the support from American taxpayers on this drug, why do you
not offer the same low price to American families?
Mr. Gonzalez. Because Humira plays a very important role in
AbbVie's overall funding of R&D. And I think it is
fundamentally underpinned by the fact that if you look at these
inventions that we have created, that were patented, as I said,
they included a number of different diseases for which Humira
was effective, and they evolved over time.
We think we have struck a reasonable balance. We have now
licensed seven biosimilar players to the entire portfolio. So
they can use that portfolio to go out and copy Humira. We have
given licenses to them, and they will all enter the market in
2023.
The earliest patent to expire in that portfolio is June of
2022. So, literally seven biosimilars will come within a year.
Senator Stabenow. Mr. Gonzales, I know my time is up. Let
me just say, I think that you charge more here because you can.
And American taxpayers are subsidizing all of you to be able to
have incredibly high profits, the fastest-growing part of the
health-care system. And I think the people in Michigan and
across the country deserve better. They need to be able to
afford the medicine and not have to go to another country to
get it.
The Chairman. Senator Cantwell?
Senator Cantwell. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I wanted to get feedback on the market-type mechanisms and
whether they would drive down costs to purchasers and to
consumers. So concepts like allowing States to negotiate on
behalf of a population for health-care plans, like the basic
health plan in New York--do they drive down cost?
[No response.]
Senator Cantwell. No one wants to take that on?
Mr. Frazier. Thank you, Senator. I did not know who the
question was addressed to.
I think first of all, it is important to recognize that
there is no single market for drugs in this country. So for
example----
Senator Cantwell. We are on limited time, and I appreciate
the chairman's great efforts. No, I am just trying to get
``yes'' and ``no'' answers whether these concepts drive down
costs--whether you believe they do. If it is a hard question to
answer, it just tells me something about how willing you are
going to be to help us with this problem.
So my point is this. States negotiating on drug prices on
behalf of a group of citizens, does it drive down prices for
consumers in your opinion, ``yes'' or ``no''?
Mr. Frazier. I would have to say, depending on the system,
it could very well do that. But I think it will do that at the
expense of a system, for example, our Medicare system that has
come in at 50 percent of what it was projected to be.
I want to come back to an issue that was raised at the
beginning about the affordability, if you will just allow me. A
significant issue in our system is that patients pay 13 percent
against the list price for drugs when they pay 3 percent
against a lower negotiated price for other medical services.
I think the primary issue in our country now is out-of-
pocket costs--13 percent is much higher than 3 percent. And if
we were designing a system, we would never design a system that
actually taxes the sicker people to pay for the healthy people.
Senator Cantwell. Okay.
I am asking a really basic question. Like the VA's ability
to negotiate on drug prices, do you think that States having
that same ability drives down price?
Mr. Frazier. I would say that the VA would get a lower
price and the States would get a lower price if you are willing
to go into an environment where that could be imposed by
States.
Senator Cantwell. Well, or the Federal Government. But in
one example--which I think you are familiar with, because I do
think you are involved with hepatitis C drugs--Washington's
Medicaid program is continuing to think about a Netflix model
where you buy the best, the lowest per-unit costs, and cover
more people. Do you think that model works in driving down
costs to consumers?
Mr. Frazier. I think that could work to drive down cost to
consumers, no question, as long as you have the State
``negotiating.'' I would object to the word. Very frequently,
when we deal with governments outside the United States, people
use the word ``negotiations.'' Those prices are imposed.
Senator Cantwell. Well, someone who is negotiating on
behalf of the patients they are trying to cover negotiates with
you or other drug companies on whether they are going to meet
that discount. They are using market forces of bundling up and
leverage. I call it a Costco model. If you buy in bulk, you get
a discount. We are clearly doing it with the VA.
The question debated here is whether we should spread that
out to cover more Federal programs, which is what is being done
in Canada, and whether we should use those same market forces
in allowing States to negotiate, at least for the working poor
in this country, a better deal than they can get because they
work for employers that do not cover them.
So I think if you guys cannot even agree that these basic
market functions that allow people to buy in bulk and get a
discount are good ideas for consumers, then I do not think you
are going to come up with anything we are going to agree on
here, because these are market functions, basic market
functions.
Does anybody else want to add whether they believe in these
market functions?
Mr. Gonzalez. Yes, Senator. I would just illustrate one
point.
I think your point is a valid one for the overall system
costs, but I think what Mr. Frazier was describing is a
critical issue.
There are two affordability issues here. There is the
affordability to the system, and there is the affordability to
the patient. Both have challenges, but the affordability to
patients now has really gotten out of hand.
I will give you an example, my HCV example. We cut the
price by 72 percent, the list price by 72 percent. The out-of-
pocket cost in Medicare is $3,250. The same patient who could
not afford the out-of-pocket cost at $7,000, unfortunately
cannot afford $3,250.
Senator Cantwell. Well, I will tell you what is absurd is
the fact that you got a $6.3-billion tax break in the last tax
bill and you cannot even say that you are for basic market
functions like giving people discounts when they are bundled
and you get volume.
So I guess we will have a tough time coming to something--
but I know people here are going to want basic market functions
to drive down costs for consumers.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Senator Cornyn?
Senator Cornyn. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Gonzalez, I want to focus on Humira. Obviously it
generates about $18 billion of revenue for your company each
year. Is that right?
Mr. Gonzalez. That is correct.
Senator Cornyn. Please understand that I get it. We want to
make sure that we maintain the most innovative pharmaceutical
drug companies in the world, because we want to provide
lifesaving cures for our people. And I get the idea that that
is the purpose of the patent system, which is to protect the
exclusivity of that drug that you have sunk a lot of money into
the research and development for. And I support our patent
system. I think it is very important.
But what I do not understand is, according to my
information here, Humira has 247 patents. And some of those
patents do not expire until 2034. As Senator Stabenow pointed
out, Humira first was sold to patients in 2003.
So is it your company's position that it should have an
exclusive monopoly on that medication for 31 years?
Mr. Gonzalez. Senator, no, it is not. It is essentially
that the patents cover innovations that we created. And I think
one of the things that has been lost here is, it does not
matter how many patents you have--and those are applications
that you described, not actual patents. But there is a large
portfolio of patents. It has 136 patents, and together----
Senator Cornyn. So you have 247 patent applications, but
you have 61 patents? How many patents do you----
Mr. Gonzalez. No. I am sorry. A hundred and thirty-six
patents.
Senator Cornyn. A hundred and thirty six patents on one
drug?
Mr. Gonzalez. But well, remember, Humira is like 9
different drugs or 10 different drugs. So----
Senator Cornyn. I thought you said to Senator Stabenow it
was the same molecule.
Mr. Gonzalez. It is the same molecule, but it treats
different conditions. And if you look at that patent
portfolio----
Senator Cornyn. So you use the same molecule to treat
different conditions, and you can get a patent on that
treatment?
Mr. Gonzalez. Certainly. Now, an example of one of the
areas that got a significant number of patents is inflammatory
bowel disease. After we developed it for RA, we realized that
Humira might work in that area. That was an area that was
under-treated. Most drugs had failed.
We did 20 clinical trials to determine how to make Humira
work in those patients. And we were issued a large number of
patents for the discovery work that we did in that area.
But in the end, the number of patents is not something that
protects a product. If a competitor wants to make a generic
version of a product--there are patents everywhere. The
question is, does the invention stop the biosimilar player from
making the product? If the invention does not, the patent is
meaningless. If the invention and----
Senator Cornyn. The patent gives you an exclusive right to
produce a drug.
Mr. Gonzalez. No, we do not block any biosimilars.
Biosimilars can make the product----
Senator Cornyn. No, no. Maybe you misunderstood. A patent,
during its term, gives you exclusive rights to produce a drug.
Correct?
Mr. Gonzalez. No.
Senator Cornyn. No?
Mr. Gonzalez. No. The composition-of-matter patent would
give you exclusive rights to produce the drug. But the patents
that are covered in this portfolio are for individual
innovations that were created. And in many cases, when we go
into an area, there are always patents. The first thing you do
is, you look to see, can I design around those patents?
If ultimately you determine you cannot design around those
patents, then you go to the player who has the patent and you
negotiate a license. And we have now given license to virtually
every single biosimilar player--with the exception of one--and
we have done it literally 10 years before the last patent
expires in that portfolio.
So we have tried to strike what we think is a reasonable
balance. I realize it may not be popular, but I think it is a
reasonable balance. Those----
Senator Cornyn. But what I am concerned about is--as I told
you at the outset, I support drug companies covering a profit,
based on their R&D and their development of innovative drugs.
But at some point, that patent has to end, that exclusivity has
to end so that the patients get access to those drugs at a much
cheaper cost.
It is true that you, your company, blocked Amgen for a
number of years from seeking to produce a Humira biosimilar or
equivalent; correct?
Mr. Gonzalez. Amgen has a license in the United States
right now to be able to produce----
Senator Cornyn. But you blocked them for 5 years, right?
Mr. Gonzalez. No, we did not block them.
Senator Cornyn. You sued them.
Mr. Gonzalez. They came to us, and they wanted access to
the portfolio that we had. And we licensed them.
Senator Cornyn. Did you sue them?
Mr. Gonzalez. We did, yes.
Senator Cornyn. And you entered into an agreement with them
that accommodated both your needs and their needs, I assume.
Mr. Gonzalez. We licensed them a patent portfolio. They pay
us a royalty on the patent portfolio when they come to market,
and that is essentially just like any other license.
Senator Wyden. Mr. Chairman, I do not want to interrupt.
Senator Cornyn is dead right, and that is exactly the same
point I was going to make.
Senator Cornyn. Mr. Chairman, could I just make a
suggestion that----
The Chairman. Go ahead.
Senator Cornyn. I know this topic is within the
jurisdiction of the Finance Committee, but those of us like you
and me who are also on the Judiciary Committee, which has
jurisdiction over the patent system, I think this is an area
that we need to look into through our Judiciary Committee
authorities as well.
The Chairman. Why don't you take that up with Senator
Graham, and I will make sure that I back you up on it.
Senator Cornyn. I will look forward to your back-up.
The Chairman. And let me know what your conversation
produces.
Senator Cornyn. Thank you.
The Chairman. The next four would be Menendez, Thune,
Carper, and Isakson.
Senator Menendez?
Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Let me say a few words before asking some questions. To the
New Jersey companies here today, thank you for coming. I am
proud our State is at the forefront of innovation.
But even in New Jersey, where the pharmaceutical industry
and related fields like medical research employ hundreds of
thousands of people, the overwhelming majority of the more than
9 million New Jerseyans believe drug prices are too high. And
so I think we all have to be responsive to that challenge
collectively.
Americans everywhere reject the notion that reducing
prescription drug costs means reducing innovation. They are
uniting around this issue. And it is not a Democratic or
Republican priority. It is bipartisan. Maybe it is for
political reasons, but President Trump is talking more and more
about executive action.
A Republican chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator
Grassley, has convened this hearing today, the second of two on
prescription drugs. And reducing prescription drug prices has
become a focal point of virtually every Democratic presidential
campaign.
So consider it a friendly warning from someone who believes
in the hope that you provide patients in need of new cures and
treatments: it is time to be proactive, because if you do not
make the meaningful action to reduce prescription drug prices,
policymakers are inevitably going to do it for you. So I just
hope you will take that to heart.
Let me ask you, many corporations--not just pharmaceutical
ones--received a huge windfall from the Trump tax bill. Your
companies spent well over $40 billion buying back your own
stock in the past year. Going down the row, can you just give
me the ballpark number? Did any of you use your tax breaks to
lower the costs of any of your prescription drugs?
Mr. Gonzalez. We did not use our tax break to lower the
cost of prescription drugs. We used it for other aspects of
trying to stimulate the economy and invest further in the
United States.
Senator Menendez. No, you did not use it to lower the cost.
Mr. Soriot. Senator, the tax break for us, being based in
the UK, had a very marginal impact on our profitability. So I
think the question is----
Senator Menendez. The question is--it is a simple ``yes''
or ``no.'' Whatever the tax break was, did you use any part of
it to lower the cost of prescription drugs?
Mr. Soriot. Well, the cost of our prescription drugs on the
net basis has been declining for many years now. Senator Wyden
took----
Senator Menendez. I am sorry to interrupt you, Mr. Soriot.
It is a simple question. Did you use any part of the tax break
that you got to lower the cost of your prescription drugs?
Mr. Soriot. In a roundabout way, yes, we did, because the
minimal tax benefit we got helped us sustain our profitability
at the same time as our prices were declining.
Senator Menendez. Dr. Caforio?
Dr. Caforio. We did not.
Ms. Taubert. Hello, Senator. It provided us the opportunity
to invest an incremental $30 billion in R&D and capital
investments in the U.S. over the next 4 years. We think that
that is the best way for us to be able to deliver for patients.
Senator Menendez. Mr. Frazier?
Mr. Frazier. Senator, our effective tax rate went up from
19.1 to 19.8 percent.
Dr. Bourla. We did use this tax break to do many things,
among them reduce our prices. Prices in 2018, for the first
time since I remember, went down at Pfizer.
Dr. Brandicourt. As a French company headquartered in
Paris, we did not get much from the tax break. On the GAAP
basis, we lowered our global tax rate by 1.5 percent.
Senator Menendez. All right.
Now, in November 2017, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb
called on pharmaceutical companies to ``end the shenanigans
when it comes to the ability of potential competitors to
purchase branded doses at full market price.'' He stated, ``I
see this clearly, for example, in steps branded companies
sometimes take to make it hard, or altogether impossible, for
generic firms to get access to the doses of the branded
companies needed in order to complete bioequivalence studies
that the FDA requires for a generic approval.''
I have co-sponsored legislation called CREATES that ends
the gamesmanship by certain companies, where they prevent
generic manufacturers from accessing the necessary samples they
need to develop generics. Last year the FDA published its first
list of medicines that generic companies have had trouble
accessing. That list includes more than 170 complaints covering
50 medicines.
So can you go down the line and tell me, ``yes'' or ``no,''
does your company in any way restrict access to, or block the
purchase of samples at full market price?
Mr. Gonzalez. No, we do not.
Mr. Soriot. No, we do not.
Dr. Caforio. We do not. We support the current version of
the CREATES Act.
Ms. Taubert. No, we do not.
Mr. Frazier. No, we do not.
Dr. Bourla. No, we do not, and we support CREATES.
Dr. Brandicourt. No, we do not, and we support CREATES too.
Senator Menendez. I have other questions. I am going to
submit them for the record. Thank you.
The Chairman. Thank you.
Senator Carper?
Senator Carper. Thanks to each of you for joining us today.
My wife lost her mother when she was 11 years old. My wife said
it put a hole in her heart. She has never gotten over it. My
own mother, her mother, and her grandmother, by the time they
were 80, they did not know who they were, or where they were,
or who we were.
For all of us this is personal, and it is political, and it
is economic. When we have a hearing of this nature, one of the
things I like to do with disparate witnesses like these--you
are all from the same industry, but you have different views,
come from different parts of the world. But I am going to, in a
minute, give you--what I am looking for is consensus. What I
think we are looking for is consensus agreement on what is the
right thing to do to make sure that what we are producing is
effective and affordable for us, for the government, for our
constituents.
I am going to give you three items and ask you to tell us
what you think. If we do nothing else, those three items, we
can all agree on those. Okay, and I will give them to you right
now.
The first is eliminating rebates to PBMs. That is the first
one: eliminating rebates to PBMs. The second is value-based
arrangements. And the third is increasing transparency
industry-wide on how you set your prices--increasing
transparency industry-wide on how you set your prices.
If you would like to take a moment--and we would just start
with you, Mr. Gonzalez. We will just start with this question
first and see if we have time to get it done. I hope we do,
those three.
Mr. Gonzalez. I would say that we clearly support providing
the discount at the patient level, so eliminating rebates,
essentially.
We absolutely support value-based pricing, because that is
the business we are in and the kinds of diseases we are trying
to treat and cure.
And we absolutely support transparency. And I would say
transparency even more broadly across the entire system,
including everyone that is in the supply chain. And that would
also include where government rebates are, such as the 340B
program. We would support total transparency across that.
Senator Carper. Thank you. I would ask each of our other
witnesses to also keep your responses short.
Mr. Soriot?
Mr. Soriot. Senator, I would give the same responses. We
support all three items.
I would go one step beyond, which is if the rebates--as I
said earlier--were to be removed from Part D and the commercial
sector, we would actually reduce our list prices by the
rebates' amount, less the fees that are probably single-digit
type fees to be paid to wholesalers and other stakeholders in
the system.
Since you talked about a disease that is very common and
becoming more common and a tragedy for people who suffer from
it, Senator, I would just like to say that, as Mr. Frazier said
a bit earlier, his company spent a billion dollars on
developing a drug for Alzheimer's. Our company together with
Lilly, we spent $900 million to try to develop an Alzheimer's
drug that failed.
And that is a really good reminder of the risks that we
take as an industry. We spent $900 million, many years of work,
and at the end of the day, nothing.
Senator Carper. Thank you.
Dr. Caforio?
Dr. Caforio. Yes, Senator. First of all, I am very sorry--
--
Senator Carper. Please be very brief.
Dr. Caforio. I would say that not only do we support all
three elements that you mentioned, but I do believe those three
elements together with the continued effort to develop a
generic and biosimilar market would mean significant change,
and would clearly alleviate the concerns that patients have
today.
Senator Carper. Great. Thank you, sir.
Ms. Taubert?
Ms. Taubert. Senator, first of all, I am very sorry for
your wife's family and also for your family. It underscores----
Senator Carper. While I said that, everybody in this room
could probably point to similar experiences. All of us have had
them.
Ms. Taubert. Absolutely.
Senator Carper. Thank you.
Ms. Taubert. We are very supportive of all three elements
that you outlined. So the elimination of----
Senator Carper. That is all I need.
Ms. Taubert. Perfect.
Senator Carper. Thank you.
Mr. Frazier?
Mr. Frazier. We too support all three.
Senator Carper. Thank you.
Dr. Bourla. Senator, all three elements are
transformational for our industry, will disrupt it. However, we
do agree that these are the three things that need to be done,
and also I believe that they will have significant, meaningful
results if we do them.
Senator Carper. Thank you, sir.
Dr. Brandicourt. We strongly support the three, Senator,
but we want to keep in mind at the end of the chain, the
patient has to benefit. So if rebates are removed, it has to be
to the benefit of patients.
Senator Carper. Good. Thanks.
Mr. Chairman, I am going to do a follow-up question in
writing, asking your responses, your reaction to what is going
on in Germany on this front--what do you like about it, what
concerns you might have about it. But that is a different
question, but it relates to this discussion.
Thank you.
The Chairman. Before Senator Thune goes, can I ask Dr.
Caforio, did you say you support the CREATES Act as well?
Dr. Caforio. I did, Chairman Grassley.
The Chairman. Thank you. As sponsor of that, I appreciate
that very much.
Dr. Caforio. Thanks for your work in that area.
The Chairman. Senator Thune?
Senator Thune. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I would like to ask unanimous consent to insert for the
record a one-page document from 340B Health that shows that
manufacturer discounts account for less than 2 percent of the
total drug market.
The Chairman. Without objection, so ordered.
[The document appears in the appendix on p. 1,053.]
Senator Thune. Thank you.
Each of you has referenced the recently proposed rebate
rule, which outlined several different scenarios of how drug
companies and others would react, as well as the impact on Part
D premiums.
Mr. Frazier and Dr. Bourla, if the rule were finalized,
could you please discuss how you would set list price and how
your negotiations would work with others in the supply chain?
Mr. Frazier. Okay, assuming that--as I said when I answered
the question before, assuming that we do change the systems on
the commercial side and the Medicare side so that no one
company faces a disadvantage, we would be lowering list prices.
We have been asked to lower list prices. We have lowered
list prices in the past and found that it creates a financial
disadvantage for the company, and it does not get us more
volume because of the incentives in the system. So if we change
all the incentives at one time, then list prices can come down.
Senator Thune. Dr. Bourla?
Dr. Bourla. Fifty percent of the American people are in
commercial plans, and these rebate rules apply to Medicare. If
the rules apply to all, definitely the list price will go down.
But also, during the Medicare-only application, we pledge
and we commit that every single dollar will go to the patients.
As the chairman said, the list price is not irrelevant. It
is very relevant for a lot of people, because they have to pay
list price during the deductible period. However, if the rebate
rule is applied, then it becomes irrelevant because the
patients will not be paying the list price at the purchase
point. And this is a significant win.
What I want to say is that, even if we do not move it to
commercial, which I overwhelmingly support, I think it is a
significant win for the American people if we do it even in
Medicare only.
Senator Thune. So Medicare-only would be an improvement,
but you pointed out in your testimony the challenges associated
with the bifurcated market with respect to rebate reform. So
how would manufacturers respond if the rebate rule were
finalized for government programs? I mean, what does that mean
for the commercial market?
Dr. Bourla. Senator, as I said before, all these proposals
we are discussing, including eliminating the rebate rule, are
transformational and will disrupt the way we do business. I do
not know exactly how the system will evolve, and I really do
not favor a bifurcated system. I would like to have a
transparent, single system across both parts. So we need to see
how the whole thing will evolve.
Senator Thune. Okay.
You have each expressed support, and this was alluded to
earlier by Senator Carper, for paying for value as well as the
value your medicines bring to the health-care system. I am a
believer in value-based insurance design as a way to lower the
overall health-care costs, and I have worked on legislation to
advance this principle.
As we drive toward paying for value, how do we make sure
that you as drug manufacturers still have the incentives to
keep your prices low and that we are not just shifting money
around in the system?
Dr. Bourla. I think by definition that a value-based
arrangement will align the incentives, not only of us, but
those of the insurance companies, around one common goal: the
good for the patient, clinical outcomes, measurable clinical
outcomes for the patient and the health-care system.
In this case, if we fail to produce drugs through our
research efforts that will have meaningful clinical benefits
for the patients, yes, we will not be paid. And this system
also will ensure the medicines that do not add value will be
paid much much less. So to create space for medicines that do
create value is the best way of aligning the incentives of
everyone around the interest of the patients.
Senator Thune. Does anybody else want to react to that?
Mr. Soriot. Yes, Senator, if you allow me.
We have an example that I quoted before. We have a product
that is used for the treatment of patients who have experienced
a heart attack.
If you experience a heart attack, when you are discharged
from the hospital, your chance of getting a second heart attack
is pretty high. So we contracted with an organization and
committed to reducing the percentage of patients who have a
second heart attack.
In return, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, for
these Medicare patients, committed to ask these patients to pay
a very low co-pay to make sure they were complying with their
treatment. And that actually delivers value to the system,
because patients are kept healthy. Of course, good for them,
but also they do not go back to the hospital. This is how we
deliver value.
Senator Thune. Okay. Thanks.
Mr. Gonzalez. Senator, I would just add one point. I think
your point is a valid one. Look, an innovative pharmaceutical
cannot capture 100 percent of the value that it saves. It has
to capture less than that.
And I think the way that will evolve the best is if there
is strong market competition. I remember back in HCV, if you
look at the health economic data around that drug, it would
have suggested that you could justify a price well north of
$100,000 per patient. And the prices were relatively close to
that when there was one player in the market. Today prices have
gravitated down to about $25,000-$26,000 per patient.
It is the market force that created that, the market
competition of more than one player being in that market and
competing on an active basis. We were obviously part of that
competition that drove those prices in that direction.
So I do not think it is realistic to assume that a
pharmaceutical, just because it can save $150,000, as an
example, that it can charge $150,000. It has to charge less
than that so that the overall system can benefit from the value
of that medicine. But it has to be able to charge a price that
is reasonable enough to be able to achieve and continue to fund
the programs going forward.
The Chairman. Senator Isakson, and then Senator Cardin.
Senator Isakson. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I thank all of you for being here. This is a terrific
hearing, and we are going to have a lot of hearings on this
subject. I told my staff a couple of weeks ago, I said, ``You
know, I have been a solid supporter of the pharmaceutical
industry all my career,'' and I have, and I appreciate all that
you do.
I go to work every day because of levodopa. I would not be
able to be here today if it was not for the pharmaceutical
industry, and I have Parkinson's disease. But I can function
every day and do my job because of that, and I appreciate it
every day.
My first chief of staff called me Sunday night from
Children's Hospital in Atlanta to say his youngest son had just
been diagnosed with juvenile diabetes. His first child, a
daughter, had juvenile diabetes 12 years ago. But the thing he
said was, ``At least I know that you can live a normal, happy
life because of insulin and because of pharmaceutical care.''
So I am not softening you up, but I am softening you up,
because those are good stories that we cannot forget. And that
is the value of innovation and research development, and we
appreciate it.
However, when you cannot explain it and you are elected to
the U.S. Senate--and I appreciate your comment about how
honored you are to be in the U.S. Senate, Dr. Bourla--but the
fact of the matter is, when I cannot explain it, it is tough.
And I cannot explain the cost increases I have seen a lot of
recently.
One medicine I take--I take eight a day--one of the ones I
take every day went up. When I went to get my new prescription
in January, it was $90 more than it was at the end of last
year.
I just said, ``How can that be?'' And the guy said this and
that and the other. But he said, ``Let me call you back.'' He
said, ``I will call you in the next hour and see if I cannot
find a better price.''
In an hour's time he had four prices for the same
pharmaceutical. If I did not use insurance, it was one price.
If I used cash, it was another price. If I took discounts, it
was another price. If you had coupons, it was another price.
I do not remember the name of all of them, but I know it
was very complicated, and it reminded me of my business. When I
sold real estate, the price of a mortgage was not just the
interest rate that you paid and the sticker price, but you take
the effect of discount points and rebates and other things that
go into the annual percentage rate return of the product, and
that is what you are doing with discounts and with rebates, I
assume. And it is going into the cost and ultimately into your
product, which caused me to ask this question: who sets the
discount and who sets the rebate?
Pardon my finger. We will start with you, Mr. Gonzalez.
Mr. Gonzalez. Thank you, Senator.
I think the best way to illustrate what you are describing
is to give you an example.
Senator Isakson. A short example, please.
Mr. Gonzalez. Okay.
Humira--we raised the price in 2019 6.2 percent. The actual
fall-through to the company, the realized increase in 2019,
will be .9 percent. So the part in between there is rebates
that have gone up and channel mix, primarily. But it does give
you some idea of the massive change that can occur between list
and realized price.
We raised the price to try to offset inflation, merit
increases that we give our employees, and increases in R&D----
Senator Isakson. So you set the discount or the rebate?
Mr. Gonzalez. Well, we negotiate with payers. So managed
care----
Senator Isakson. You are a supplier, though. So you
negotiate with the PBMs and those people? Is that right?
Mr. Gonzalez. Correct, and they negotiate aggressively.
Senator Isakson. Is that pretty much true, everybody, that
they are the major component between the end retail consumer
price and the origin of the product?
Mr. Gonzalez. Yes, Senator.
Senator Isakson. Well, that seems like some place we ought
to focus, because that is where the distorted numbers come in.
Johnson & Johnson--and I'm sorry. Janssen, is that right?
Is that the subsidiary?
Ms. Taubert. Yes, Janssen; correct.
Senator Isakson. In your testimony you talk about your
average list price of 8.1 percent up, but an average net price
change of only 4.6 percent. So, while your gross went up 8.6,
your net went down 4.6 in the same pricing period.
How does that happen? How does it not go up on the bottom?
Ms. Taubert. Yes, and in fact in 2018, our net price
actually declined 8.6 percent, so even more than that. So the
intermediaries in the system are very very effective
negotiators.
Senator Isakson. Tell me who the intermediaries are.
Ms. Taubert. Those would be the PBMs and the insurers.
Senator Isakson. And the insurance companies?
Ms. Taubert. Right, and they set the formularies for
patients.
Senator Isakson. And they are not the same, because they
are two different people?
Ms. Taubert. Yes, correct.
And so what they do----
Senator Isakson. Excuse me for interrupting Ms. Taubert. I
want to make sure I get all of this in. And I apologize. You
are a nice lady, and I am being ugly to do that. But I am
sorry.
Ms. Taubert. I am fine.
Senator Isakson. All right. We have the PBMs and we have
the insurance companies.
Ms. Taubert. Yes.
Senator Isakson. Is there anybody else between the
wholesale price by the manufacturer at the beginning and the
retail price it is sold for at the end, at the drugstore? Is
there anybody else that contributes to the cost, other than the
discount and the rebate?
Dr. Brandicourt. Several actors, Senator, in the supply
chain are rewarded on the listing price: wholesalers
themselves, and----
Senator Isakson. Is that a consumption bonus? Is that a
sales bonus? They are rewarded for doing what?
Dr. Brandicourt. Well, to be a wholesaler and distribute
our products. What we need to do in order to realign the
incentive is to get rid of the reward being based on a listing
price.
Senator Isakson. I have to stop, because the chairman is
mean and he will cut me off the next time.
So I will end by saying this. You answered my question, but
it does point out that the one person who is not benefiting
from the rebates, not benefiting from the cost negotiation, is
the customer. And we are here for the customer today. We
represent them. So we have to get to the bottom of this so we
can have something we can explain, and they can experience.
I apologize, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. I let the Senator go because he was echoing
my beliefs.
Go ahead, Senator Cardin.
Senator Cardin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And let me thank
all of our witnesses. I also want to say how proud I am of the
results of the pharmaceutical industry and the discoveries that
you have made, innovations that you have brought to market, the
impact you have had on quality of life and on cost, overall
cost of health care, by the discoveries that you have been able
to advance.
The challenge that we all have is, why should Americans be
shouldering the lion's share of the cost and burden of research
and development and bringing new drugs to market? You talk
about burden-sharing, you talk about the fact that there should
be a fair allocation on the global market--and by the way, also
within our domestic market, we know that a lot of people are
being denied access to these innovative drugs because of the
pricing mechanisms within the United States.
So let me try to drill down on those points. Really, am I
defending an administration policy? So let me break with my
normal tradition and talk about the international pricing
mechanism that the Trump administration is proposing that would
set target prices or international pricing indexes over a 5-
year period for Part B drugs pinned to the price in comparable
industrial nations, phasing it in over a period of time and
allowing a cushion for even higher prices in the United States.
So if, in fact, these drugs are already priced
competitively, that should not be a problem. But as I
understand it, there are so many drugs that we pay, American
consumers pay, a lot more for than consumers in other
industrial nations. So why not move towards a process in which
American consumers share a similar price as consumers in other
industrial nations in the world, particularly on the Part B
program? I think it could also be extended to Part D.
The only explanation I have heard is that in some
countries, it takes a little bit longer to get new drugs
admitted. We are not talking about new drugs. We are talking
here about drugs that already have an existing price mechanism.
Or do you support it?
Dr. Caforio. Senator, thanks for your question.
I did mention this in my opening remarks. So I am happy to
elaborate further. I think it is a very important point.
So we take the perspective that we should always start from
patient access to medicines.
Senator Cardin. I am going to try to drill down, because I
only have 2 minutes.
Dr. Caforio. Thank you.
Senator Cardin. So what is wrong with a model of comparing
U.S. prices to prices in other industrial nations?
Dr. Caforio. So 55 percent of new cancer medicines that are
available to American patients are not reimbursed in at least--
--
Senator Cardin. We are talking about where there is a
market price in another country, because if there is no target
price, there is no price to compare it to. So there has to be a
price in another country. So we are talking about drugs that
are commonly available.
Dr. Caforio. I believe, Senator, many of the most recently
introduced drugs are not available in----
Senator Cardin. Then that would not apply. If I understand,
it only deals with prices where there is a target price that
already exists. If the drug is not on the market, it is not
going to have a target price. But if the drug is on the market,
you have a target price, and as I understand it, that would
bring down the cost here in the United States.
Dr. Caforio. I believe, Senator, it would be very important
for us to be thinking about policies that continue to reward
innovation.
We do need your support to make sure that----
Senator Cardin. So you are basically saying we overpay on
available drugs so that you can make more profit from the
American consumer to underwrite R&D which benefits the global
community. That is basically, as I understand that point--to me
that is a disconnect in the pricing mechanism.
I want to ask, Ms. Taubert, you are the one who mentioned
the advantages of the free market in negotiations under Part D.
So let me just change the equation. Suppose you were on the
other side of the table. Why not allow the Health Secretary to
combine the entire Medicare market in order to negotiate a
larger market share to bring down costs for Medicare?
Ms. Taubert. Yes, so we really believe that open
competition and a free market are the right way to go for
patients.
Senator Cardin. But isn't market share that you can offer,
as a person seeking the cost, a driver for bringing down costs?
Ms. Taubert. So the PBMs and the insurers are
extraordinarily effective negotiators. And they do negotiate
now on behalf of Part D members quite aggressively.
In fact, I mentioned our $21 billion----
Senator Cardin. And my question is, is it not true that the
larger the market share, the better the price you are going to
get?
Ms. Taubert. The larger the market share, the better the
price? It depends on a number of factors, including the number
of competitors and the companies that are bidding to try to
get----
Senator Cardin. If you control more of the market, isn't
that going to bring down your price? I learned that in
Economics 101.
The Chairman. Answer the question, and then we will go to
Senator Hassan.
Ms. Taubert. Yes; I am not sure I understand the last piece
of that question.
Senator Cardin. With a larger consumer base on a drug,
because you represent all the Medicare market, are you not in a
stronger negotiating position? Yes, you are.
Ms. Taubert. I think conceptually you could be. I would say
that the PBMs and insurers are pretty darn effective right now.
The Chairman. Senator Hassan?
Senator Hassan. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I want
to thank you and Ranking Member Wyden for this hearing today.
I want to thank all of the witnesses for being here today
as well. A couple of observations; one is that breakthroughs
are not breakthroughs if people cannot afford the medicine that
produces the breakthrough.
Secondly, as you have all mentioned the importance of a
viable and predictable system, it has to be a viable and
predictable system for patients. And right now it is so
convoluted and so non-transparent that my constituents cannot
figure out what the price of their medication is going to be
day to day. And despite a wonderful staff, I feel like I need a
Ph.D. in prescription drug pricing to understand how the heck
this industry works. And that should not be the way we proceed
in this country to get these breakthroughs to people.
But I want to talk about a slightly different aspect of
your industry right now. We have been talking about drug
pricing, which is one part of how drug companies make money.
The other part is how you maximize sales.
So, Ms. Taubert, I would like to focus on how your company
maximizes sales for a particular class of drugs--opioids. Can
you define for me please, Ms. Taubert, what pseudo-addiction
is?
Ms. Taubert. I am sorry. I am not sure. I am not familiar
with that term.
Senator Hassan. Let me fill you in, then. Pseudo-addiction
is an unproven and dubious concept that asserts that certain
patients present signs of addiction because they were
prescribed insufficient doses of opioids. Those peddling this
pseudo-addiction concept say that instead of providing
addiction treatment when somebody shows the signs of addiction,
the doctor should increase their opioid doses. Even one of the
original doctors who pushed this theory now admits it was ``an
excuse to give patients more drugs.''
He has told us that Janssen promoted this made-up concept
of pseudo-addiction on a website that it approved and funded
that was called ``Let's Talk Pain.'' Since then, your company
has repeatedly said that your action ``in the marketing and
promotion of our opioid pain medicines was appropriate and
responsible.'' So, Ms. Taubert, how can you possibly claim that
promoting the theory of pseudo-addiction--the doctor should
prescribe more opioids to patients showing signs of addiction--
was appropriate and responsible?
Ms. Taubert. Senator, thank you so much for that question.
Abuse and addiction, particularly opioid abuse and addiction,
are very serious public health concerns, and we recognize the
impact on the American public.
Senator Hassan. So then the question is--and again like
everybody else, I have only a few minutes here. The question
is, looking back at what your company did promoting pseudo-
addiction--an unproven theory that was just used to maximize
sales of a deadly drug--why is that something that you are
calling appropriate and responsible?
Ms. Taubert. So, I am sorry. I am not familiar with the
term.
What I can say is, on behalf of our company, opioids
represent less than 1 percent of our product.
Senator Hassan. All right, let me stop you right there,
because my constituents do not care about the percentage. They
care about the behavior to maximize sales in an industry.
Do you know how many Americans died from drug overdoses in
2017?
Ms. Taubert. Far too many.
Senator Hassan. It was 70,237. In 1 year, more Americans
died from drug overdoses than died fighting the entire war in
Vietnam. And the vast majority of those overdose deaths, about
50,000, were from opioids.
My constituents are dying. Nearly 500 people in New
Hampshire died from overdoses last year. And nearly 500 the
year before that. And companies like Janssen and Purdue Pharma
fueled this epidemic, employing deceptive and truly
unconscionable marketing tactics despite the known risks so you
could sell more drugs to maximize your profits.
And now you are refusing to take responsibility for your
company's role in this crisis. So one more time, do you truly
think that Janssen's opioid marketing practices were
appropriate and responsible, or will you finally take
responsibility for your company's role in helping create this
crisis that is killing more than 100 Americans every day?
Ms. Taubert. Everything that I have seen leads me to
conclusively believe that everything that we have done with our
products, when we promoted opioid products, which we stopped
marketing a long time ago, was very appropriate and
responsible.
However, that being said, we do believe that we have a
leadership position to take in helping with this. And so we are
doing a number of things in terms of mothers and babies, and
physician and patient education to help----
Senator Hassan. So let me--again----
[Simultaneous speech.]
Ms. Taubert. We recognize we all play a part in trying to
help this, because we realize that----
Senator Hassan. Our time is done, but right now it is hard
for me to take the industry's goal here as promoting good
health seriously when its behavior to maximize sales of opioids
created an epidemic.
The Chairman. Senator Lankford?
Senator Lankford. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you all for being here. And there are people alive in
the United States, around the world right now, because of your
companies and the work they have done with R&D along with the
National Institutes of Health. And I fully acknowledge that,
and I am grateful to the people who are researching and working
right now, who are not watching this hearing because their face
is in a microscope actually going through things to be able to
research today and what they are doing.
With that said--it is all of us who acknowledge that. We
are trying to figure out the issue on drug pricing, because
people in my State, whether they are on insulin or whether on
Parkinson's drugs, or whether my own family or other people in
my neighborhood, it is a very significant issue for them to try
to figure out how to be able to manage this. So we have to get
to the bottom of how we manage this.
All of you have mentioned that the rebate issue has been a
problem and that insurance companies and PBMs are very
effective negotiators. Part of the challenge of this is, health
insurance companies pay their PBM based on the quality of their
negotiation skills, cutting a price off the list price. And so,
if a list price is higher and a rebate is higher, that also
gives preference to them. So the difficulty is, as you raise
list price and the rebate gets larger, the insurance company
gives that preference, making it harder for biosimilars. Am I
tracking this correctly?
So the challenge that we have with this is, how do we
figure out how to break this down? Because we have insurance
companies, PBMs, your companies that are creating the list
prices, and then the biosimilars trying to be able to get into
this.
So, Mr. Frazier, you mentioned this, in particular about
biosimilars and the difficulty of trying to be able to break
into the market. Would you identify why it is hard for
biosimilars to get into the market, which are inherently less
expensive?
Mr. Frazier. I would make two suggestions very quickly,
because I know you only have a little bit of time here. One is,
I think we have to educate physicians and other health-care
providers about the value of biosimilars. I think, secondly, it
would be very helpful if we could relieve patients of their
obligation to pay copays for the cheaper biosimilars.
Those would be two specific recommendations that I would
make.
Senator Lankford. Thank you. I appreciate that. For the
Part B drugs, those physicians are paid a percentage of the
drug costs. So a biosimilar, when it comes into the market in
the Part B world, is, on its own, less attractive to a
physician because a physician gets a higher percentage amount
prescribing the more expensive drug, which then feeds down to
the patient and the taxpayers, right?
Mr. Frazier. That is correct.
Senator Lankford. How do we break that chain?
Mr. Frazier. I think that we--there are many ways that we
would have to look at it. I do not have a specific suggestion
here.
I do think educating physicians is important here, and I
think relieving patients, but we also have to look at the
incentives.
Dr. Bourla. Maybe I can----
Senator Lankford. Dr. Bourla, please jump in, because you
had mentioned this in your testimony as well.
Dr. Bourla. I did, Senator, and thank you for giving me the
opportunity.
Let me give you a statistic that I think will present the
magnitude of the problem. Here in the U.S., the penetration of
biosimilars is much lower than in other places, but it is
disproportional to different parts of the U.S. health-care
system.
For example, in open systems, systems where the decision-
maker is a PBM, one biosimilar or two has a market of 5 percent
in the U.S. In closed systems, in systems like Kaiser, for
example, with their integrated health-care systems--where the
one who decides has the whole cost of the health-care system in
its interest--we have 73 percent. Five percent versus 73
percent for the same product.
I agree with what Mr. Frazier said, that we need to create
incentives, but I would add also that we need to break this
rebate trap that creates significant disincentives for
providers, and the health-care system, and insurance companies.
Senator Lankford. Does anybody else want to jump in on
that?
Dr. Brandicourt. I can give you an example, Senator.
The insulin market has a reputation of not being very
competitive. In fact, it is, and we have biosimilars which have
reached the market and have grabbed a very significant market
share.
We believe that when insulin will not be treated as a drug,
but will be considered a biologic and can be submitted to
biosimilar regulation in 2020, the biosimilar market share and
penetration will be even higher.
Senator Lankford. Thank you.
My State, in particular, is working very hard on our
Medicaid side, working on value-based pricing. I know that is
something that several of you have mentioned before. It is the
grand challenge of not pricing a drug based on the fact that it
would be more expensive to do surgery and so we want to be
slightly under the cost of surgery.
We do have to be able to break through that model. Of
course surgery would be more expensive than most of our
treatments, but I think there is a benefit that we continue to
experiment with if the drug is effective and we have a reducing
price on it. And we can get a chance to be able to work through
that, as we have done in our State.
Mr. Frazier. We would support that.
Senator Lankford. Well, we will continue to be able to work
through other creative mechanisms. At the end, we cannot just
have the taxpayer pay more and the consumer pay less, because
that is really the consumer still paying. It just moves it to
another spot.
Mr. Chairman, thank you.
The Chairman. Senator Cassidy?
Senator Cassidy. First, think of innovation. As a doctor, I
have seen cures for hepatitis C and therapies to control HIV,
other inflammatory conditions, cancers that 30 years ago, when
I graduated from medical school, were either death sentences or
were a ticket to a lifetime of morbidity and complications. So
I thank you for that. But I also say that some of my patients
could not afford the medicine. And for them, it is as if the
innovation never took place. And that is one concern.
Secondly, another concern is, I think in some cases we do
not have value. Now, Ms. Taubert, you suggested that PBMs are
very effective negotiators. One drug that I want to bring up is
Duexis, which is a combination of over-the-counter generic
ibuprofen and Pepcid. Now, if I were to take this--and this is
not the cheapest I could find it--in the doses that are used
for Duexis, it would cost me 200 bucks a month. But it lists at
over $2,400 to $2,600 a month.
Now, that does not seem like very good negotiations on
behalf of the PBM. And if the taxpayer is paying that money for
something which over the counter is 200 bucks a month, and we
are paying $2,600 a month, it is almost as if the taxpayer has
``stupid'' written on their face, which they should not. That
is unfair.
This is not your medicine, but I use it to make the point
that, right now, Medicare has a very limited ability to
negotiate based on marginal value. And I think that is one of
the fundamental problems in this.
So that said, all things considered, since Medicare does
have this very low ability, Ms. Taubert, do you think that
Medicare should have the ability--if the PBM's negotiation does
not work--should Medicare have the ability to negotiate based
on value?
Ms. Taubert. So we are very supportive of the notion of
value-based contracting and results and----
Senator Cassidy. This is a little bit different though,
because we have been describing, on value-based contracting, is
the cancer cured or not, is the hepatitis C cured or not? This
is, my gosh, you are taking two generic medicines and charging
ten times what they would cost over the counter.
Ms. Taubert. Yes, and I agree that that example does not
make any sense.
Senator Cassidy. So is it reasonable then to ask that
Medicare would have the ability to make some sort of judgment
based upon relative value of a therapy?
Ms. Taubert. I think, as we have talked about, if the PBMs
are very effective in negotiating, we do not know that the
government would be as effective in negotiating as the
professional negotiators.
Senator Cassidy. We do not know. I agree with that, but on
the other hand it does--I have limited time. I do not mean to
be rude. I do apologize. But there is this kind of shining
example of where the PBM is not an effective negotiator. Yes,
sir, Mr. Frazier?
Mr. Frazier. I think this is where Chairman Grassley's
opening statements about transparency come in. I think one of
the keys of transparency is, it empowers patients and it
empowers other payers to actually make informed choices about
which of those two medicines makes sense.
Senator Cassidy. Now, let me ask, because someone brought
up the fact that Humira is now sold at an 80-percent discount
in Denmark. And there is a Bernstein analysis which states that
AbbVie still makes a profit because marginal cost in
manufacturing is only about 5 percent of the manufacturing.
So would this same entity have the ability to look not just
at value, but at comparable drugs and at that which would bring
value, because clearly biosimilars have had a much greater
penetration in Europe, and the United States continues to pay
top dollar for the same class of drugs. Something is
fundamentally broken in our system when the Danes get an 80-
percent discount and we do not.
Yes, sir?
Mr. Frazier. I think we have to look at the way in which
generic penetration happens outside the biosimilars market.
When a drug goes off-patent----
Senator Cassidy. Well, hang on, Mr. Frazier. I am sorry. I
just get limited time, and I am going to hold you on that.
Okay, I do not mean to--one of the things I have heard is that,
if there is some limit on that profit, it may have a negative
impact upon R&D. I think that has been a message here.
But, Dr. Brandicourt, France has a committee on
transparency which evaluates the relative added clinical
benefit of a new drug. Price is then negotiated based upon that
added benefit as well as other drugs in the market.
Is it safe to say that your company has found that it still
pays to innovate and to do R&D in France and to offer them
access to the best cutting-edge drugs?
Dr. Brandicourt. As a global company, we do have R&D in
France. However, I would not use the French system as the
benchmark of a good system.
Senator Cassidy. But they do have access to these--I have
limited time. I am sorry. They do have access to these drugs?
Dr. Brandicourt. Well, that is a very good point. Some
drugs are not put on the market because you do not get to the
right pricing and therefore the right----
Senator Cassidy. But if I am--I will finish with this. I do
not mean to be rude. I apologize.
In the international pricing index, we may quibble about
the details, but if the U.S. would be paying 1.3 times a market
basket of developed countries--a Germany, a France, a Canada,
not smaller countries--we would still be paying more than they,
but it would still have some relationship to reasonableness.
And right now, it seems as if Medicare--in the absence of the
ability to judge value--is almost a price taker when it should
not be, as the largest purchaser.
Dr. Brandicourt. You would ask countries where there is no
negotiation, where prices are imposed, to set up your U.S.
pricing. And I do not think that would be good policy.
Senator Cassidy. It is imposed now, but it is imposed from
the other side.
The Chairman. Of the people who are still here, Bennet
would be next, and then Whitehouse, and then Cortez Masto.
Go ahead, Senator Bennet.
Senator Bennet. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you so much
for holding this hearing.
There is not a town hall in Colorado where I do not hear
how expensive drugs are forcing people to choose between life-
saving treatments or food and utilities. In our last hearing
here, we heard from a mother whose son ate once a day in order
to ration his insulin, because the full cost of the monthly
treatment was $1,700. I do not think anybody here understands
how that could be the case, but it is the case.
And there has been a lot said here today about the
important research and development that is going on in this
country. And I, for one--and I know others share this view--
want to keep that in the United States. Having said that, I am
trying to understand how Federal spending goes into
prescription drug development, distribution, treatment, and
pricing and yet Americans cannot afford their medications.
The estimates of annual spending on prescription drugs
range from $320 to $480 billion a year. The fact that we cannot
even get a more precise number than that tells you something
right off the bat, but those numbers include almost $100
billion in Medicare Part D spending never paid for. Of that,
$25 billion is in Medicare Part B. Medicaid spends almost $60
billion on prescription drugs. This is what the taxpayer spends
every year on prescription drugs.
DoD and VA spending is about $11 billion. That number alone
dwarfs the R&D budgets of some of your companies. Over 6
years--slightly different point--but over 6 years between 2010
and 2016, more than $100 billion was spent in NIH funding
toward research that contributed to drug patents. Between $1
and $2 billion is claimed annually through the orphan tax
credit for drugs that treat rare diseases. Another $1 billion
is annually claimed through the research and development tax
credit. About $12 billion dollars is claimed annually through
the direct-to-consumer advertising tax credit.
I would ask you guys if I missed anything, but I think that
is a pretty complete list of what we have. Yet notwithstanding
that almost $500 billion, half a trillion dollars--by the way
Medicare, you know, to spend all that money in Medicare, we are
spending $2 for every dollar we are collecting. That delta is
largely because of drug prices in the unfunded part of Medicare
Part D.
And here is what Coloradans have recently reported. In a
recent survey on high drug prices, 22 percent did not fill a
prescription, and 20 percent reported cutting pills in half or
skipping doses.
Seventy-four percent believe drug companies are charging too
much money, and 91 percent believe the government should
authorize the Attorney General to take legal action to prevent
price gouging or unfair prescription drug price hikes--over 90
percent.
And that does not necessarily give you their legal
judgment, but that is how keenly they are feeling the problem.
And 90 percent believe the government should require drug
companies to provide advance notice of price increases and
information to justify those increases.
So, I would ask all of you, or anybody who would care to
answer, this question: how do we explain to our constituents on
the one hand that we have this massive outlay of Federal funds,
it is their taxpayer funds, and the on the other hand, the
drugs they are buying are not affordable?
And I realize there are all kinds of layers to this. I
accept that. You know, there are the higher co-pays that you
guys mentioned earlier from the insurance companies. That is a
huge issue too.
But I think that in a world where opacity or opaqueness has
been, from the public's point of view, a business model for
everybody in health care, whether it is the Federal Government
or drug companies or insurance companies or doctors, nobody
knows what anything actually costs. Nobody knows what anything
will pay.
My question, I guess, is, how do we better align the
incentives here so that that huge outlay of money every year
comes with affordable drugs at the end of the process?
Mr. Gonzalez, thank you.
Mr. Gonzalez. Senator, I can just tell you there is
probably not anybody at this table who does not agree not a
single American should go without drugs that they need. And I
can tell you, that is the case at AbbVie.
We do a lot of things to try to provide drugs for patients
who cannot afford them. But there are certain patients whom we
are unable to do that for based on the laws and the
regulations, and in particular, most of Medicare Part D falls
into that situation.
And so I believe fundamentally we have to do two things.
There are substantial discounts or rebates that are going into
this system. Take Humira as an example. In the United States,
there are rebates or discounts on that product that range from
87 percent down to 26 percent. Okay, and it is the Federal
Government that gets the highest form of discount or rebate on
Humira, even though it represents a relatively small percentage
of the volume, less than 20 percent of the overall volume.
Now that does not mean that we could not do more. But what
we are asking is, we do believe that there is a situation now
where the co-pays for patients are such that it is extremely
difficult for them to afford it. And what we are asking for
is--``we,'' meaning AbbVie and I am sure others here, would
like to do more. There is more we can do to help patients
afford their medicines, but we have to eliminate some barriers
that are blocking that.
Today we give away to 81,000 patients free drugs; half of
those are Humira. Of those Humira patients, half of them are
Medicare Part D. They are patients who make less than 500
percent of poverty, so they make less than $128,000 per year
for a family of four.
Those patients we can provide free drug for. Anybody above
that, we cannot. It is considered an inducement.
And when you look at the copay for a drug like Humira,
commercial patients, Medicaid patients, the low-income subsidy
patients in Medicare, pay less than $100 per year of copay for
Humira. A standard Part D patient pays $5,500. They make
$26,000, so they cannot afford it.
Senator Bennet. I apologize. I know I am out of time. Thank
you.
The Chairman. Senator Whitehouse?
Senator Bennet. Could I, Sheldon, just make one point,
which is, I think what we ought to be doing is figuring out how
people do not have to cut their prescription drugs in half, and
that would be a worthy goal for this committee and the people
on this panel.
The Chairman. Senator Whitehouse?
Senator Whitehouse. I would like to ask about a particular
segment of the pharmaceutical market. Chairman Grassley opened
his remarks by talking about patients taking a drug that has no
competition as being a cause for concern.
Mr. Frazier, your testimony included the statement that
price gouging by those who jack up the prices of off-patent
drugs that have no competition is a problem. Let me ask if
there is anyone on this panel who disagrees, who disagrees that
there are de facto off-patent monopolies now in the
pharmaceutical market? Does anybody disagree with that as a
fact?
Mr. Frazier. I do not disagree.
Senator Whitehouse. In fact it is true.
Mr. Frazier. There are.
Senator Whitehouse. There are.
Mr. Frazier. That is what I was saying.
Senator Whitehouse. And indeed, is it also not true that
sometimes these off-patent monopolies are used to impose
monopoly pricing?
Mr. Frazier. It is true, and I think the most egregious
examples that we have seen recently have been exactly in that
situation.
Senator Whitehouse. Does anybody disagree with that?
Everybody agrees.
Now are there, among those entities that are in that
category with off-patent monopolies that are extracting
monopoly pricing by virtue of that, entrants who are not even
really in the pharmaceutical industry?
Mr. Frazier. Absolutely there are.
Senator Whitehouse. They invest nothing in R&D.
Mr. Frazier. Exactly.
Senator Whitehouse. They do not even come from the
pharmaceutical industry.
Mr. Frazier. Yes.
Senator Whitehouse. They are more or less corporate raiders
who have bought something in order to jack up prices and take
advantage of monopoly rents. Correct?
Mr. Frazier. There are many people like that.
Senator Whitehouse. There are many people like that. Does
anybody disagree that that is a feature right now within the
pharmaceutical market? Everybody agrees?
Dr. Bourla. And I would add also, Senator, that they are
not allowed to be part of the Pharma Association.
Senator Whitehouse. So here is the problem: it is not
difficult, in my view as a lawyer of many years and a
prosecutor of many years, to prove the existence of a monopoly.
We have been proving the existence of de facto monopolies in
courtrooms and in regulatory proceedings for decades.
So we can identify where these monopolies exist, even if
you let all the ties go to the runner so that, wherever there
is a real question, you throw that one out. There still would
remain a significant population of entities where it is beyond
dispute that they are pricing based on monopoly power. And as I
look around, there is no place to address that. There is no
organization in the Federal Government that is taking an
interest in that, and it is the scandal, I view, of the
pharmaceutical industry. And you guys take a hit for it.
Here is the problem: when we try to do anything about that,
the people you pay to lobby us here in Congress come out and
say, ``Nope, we cannot do anything like that. That might look
like price control.'' We are not interested in taking any look
at this monopoly problem in your industry. I should not even
say it is in your industry, because I think a lot of these
people are raiders into your industry who are not really part
of your industry. They do not really develop drugs.
I see a lot of head-nodding here. So help us solve at least
that problem. You know, there are lots of other problems that
we are going to have to look through with your pricing. Help us
solve at least that problem. Turn off your lawyers and your
lobbyists as antagonists when we try to solve that problem.
Mr. Frazier. We will. Senator----
Senator Whitehouse. In fact, switch them on and say, let us
figure out how we deal with these modern monopolists who are
not even really in the pharmaceutical industry.
Mr. Frazier. I could not agree more. These people are at
best tone-deaf, at worse abusive.
I would also point out that there are companies here--I
know, for example, my company. There is a very important cancer
drug called TICE BCG. It was an invention of Merck. It has been
off-patent for many many years. It is an incredibly essential
drug for bladder cancer patients.
A number of companies that were making it went out of the
business. And so now we have had to double supply. Over the
last nearly 12 years the cost of that drug has increased by
$16. That is not how we make money at Merck. We make money at
Merck by inventing new drugs that did not exist before.
It is those people, I think, that contributed to the
villainizing of an industry. The public cannot distinguish
those people from the research-based companies.
Senator Whitehouse. You all say that here. There is a lot
of head-nodding here. There is a lot of agreement here.
When your lobbyists come, everybody is in and they are not
going to let anybody lose in all of this. We have to at least
cut off these people.
Mr. Frazier. Thank you for telling me that, because I never
knew that our lobbyists were opposed to that.
Senator Whitehouse. We have no support for working against
these monopoly raiders.
Dr. Brandicourt. Well, Senators, the message is very clear.
And we are going to take that very seriously as a task.
The Chairman. Senator Brown came back. So you will go ahead
of the Senator from Nevada.
Go ahead.
Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for doing
this hearing.
Thank you all for joining us. I want to thank Senator
Hassan for her questions on opioids. Eleven people a day die in
my State from opioid addiction, and there is a responsibility
shared more widely than we sometimes say.
I so appreciated Chairman Grassley's ``yes'' or ``no''
questions, and I appreciated the seven of you going along with
his ``yes'' or ``no.'' And I would like to ask a series of
``yes'' or ``no'' questions, and please keep it to ``yes'' or
``no.'' They really are ``yes'' or ``no'' questions.
Mr. Gonzales, let's start with you. Is it true that the
pharmaceutical industry benefits from U.S. taxpayer-funded
research? ``Yes'' or ``no''?
Mr. Gonzalez. It is, yes.
Senator Brown. Across, each of you.
Mr. Soriot. Yes.
Dr. Caforio. Yes.
Ms. Taubert. Yes.
Mr. Frazier. Yes.
Dr. Bourla. Yes.
Dr. Brandicourt. Yes.
Senator Brown. Okay. Thank you.
Is it true that no other nation invests more taxpayer
dollars in basic research that directly and indirectly benefits
the industry?
Mr. Gonzalez. Yes.
Mr. Soriot. Yes.
Dr. Caforio. Yes.
Ms. Taubert. Yes.
Mr. Frazier. Yes.
Dr. Bourla. I am not sure I understood the question.
Senator Brown. Is it true that no other nation on earth
invests more taxpayer dollars in basic research?
Dr. Bourla. Yes.
Dr. Brandicourt. Is it proportional to GDP, Senator?
Senator Brown. I am not asking that, but that is close
enough. Thank you.
Is it true that the U.S. Government allows drug companies
the longest period of exclusivity on biologics?
Mr. Gonzalez?
Mr. Gonzalez. I believe that is true.
Mr. Soriot. I believe that is true.
Dr. Caforio. I believe that is true.
Ms. Taubert. Yes.
Mr. Frazier. Yes.
Dr. Bourla. Yes.
Dr. Brandicourt. Yes.
Senator Brown. We know Medicare limits prices with doctors
and hospitals. Is it true that Medicare cannot negotiate to
lower prices with drug companies?
Mr. Gonzalez. That is true directly.
Mr. Soriot. Yes.
Dr. Caforio. Yes.
Ms. Taubert. Yes; other agents work on their behalf to
negotiate, but they do not negotiate directly.
Mr. Frazier. Yes, they cannot negotiate directly.
Dr. Bourla. Yes.
Dr. Brandicourt. Yes.
Senator Brown. Thank you.
Is it true U.S. taxpayers subsidize pharmaceutical
advertising and marketing activities through the tax code's
business expense deduction?
Mr. Gonzalez?
Mr. Gonzalez. Yes.
Mr. Soriot. Yes.
Dr. Caforio. Yes.
Ms. Taubert. Yes.
Mr. Frazier. Yes, no different from any other advertising,
but yes.
Dr. Bourla. Yes.
Dr. Brandicourt. Yes.
Senator Brown. Thank you.
We note the United States is the world's largest market for
pharmaceuticals. Is it true that we pay the highest--in the
overwhelming number of cases, is it true that we pay the
highest drug prices in the world?
Mr. Gonzalez?
Mr. Gonzalez. The average government price would--that
would not be the case.
Senator Brown. No, that we as Americans individually pay
the highest drug prices in the world?
Mr. Gonzalez. As an average, that would be true.
Mr. Soriot. I am not sure that it would be true, Senator,
because the generic prices are some of the lowest in the world,
and government prices, for many of our drugs even before patent
expiry, are sometimes as low as Europe or lower.
So on average, probably it is true, but there are many many
different kinds of----
Senator Brown. I know there are exceptions. I am looking
for an average.
Dr. Caforio?
Dr. Caforio. Yes, on average I would say.
Senator Brown. Ms. Taubert?
Ms. Taubert. I would say that the list prices are higher,
but the net price in the United States is more comparable to
much of the pricing outside the U.S.
Senator Brown. Mr. Frazier?
Mr. Frazier. Yes, outside Medicaid and other things, yes.
Senator Brown. Okay.
Dr. Bourla. Nine out of 10 products in the U.S. are
generics. So the pricing of the generic products is much lower
in the U.S. than other countries.
Senator Brown. Yes, but generics----
Dr. Bourla. But you are right about branded----
Senator Brown. Do not confuse generic numbers of drugs sold
with cost in the aggregate? Your answer?
Dr. Bourla. But nine out of 10, I am telling you--you are
right that in the innovation, the prices outside the U.S. in
many cases are much higher.
Dr. Brandicourt. So I would agree with that: patented
drugs, yes, generics, no.
Senator Brown. Okay. Thank you. Last question.
Is it true that drug manufacturers set the--what Ms.
Taubert talked about--list prices? Is it true that you, the
drug manufacturers, set those list prices?
Mr. Gonzalez. That is correct.
Mr. Soriot. That is correct, but of course, there is a
negotiation that takes place with PBMs and insurers about the
price and the rebate level.
Senator Brown. Dr. Caforio?
Dr. Caforio. It is true for list price, but the delta
between list and net price is the highest in the U.S.
Senator Brown. Ms. Taubert?
Ms. Taubert. Correct. Yes, we set the list price.
Senator Brown. Mr. Frazier?
Mr. Frazier. Yes, we set list price.
Senator Brown. Dr. Bourla?
Dr. Bourla. Actually, I would not agree that we set the
list price. It is the result of a major negotiation. And I have
to say that the problem in the U.S. health-care system it is
that everything is geared around list price, a lot of
incentives, which creates a hydraulic effect for the list
prices to go down.
I would be very happy to have much less list prices and the
same net.
Senator Brown. Dr. Brandicourt?
Dr. Brandicourt. Ultimately, we set the listing price.
Senator Brown. Okay. Thank you.
So taxpayers subsidize your research, subsidize your
marketing, and you continue to raise drug list prices on them.
The median income of a person on Medicare is $26,000 a year,
while the average annual cost for a single specialty medication
was more than $52,000 in 2015. Americans cannot afford to pay
for prescription drugs that cost more money than they make in a
year. We cannot continue to give big pharma the blank check
that you have had to pay for high-priced prescription drugs.
But I guess it is not surprising that big drug companies
take all the taxpayer money they can. What is so troubling is
that this Congress continues, because of the lobbyists that
Senator Whitehouse talked about and other pressures, that this
Congress continues to allow you to do so.
Thank you for answers.
The Chairman. The Senator from Nevada.
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you for being here. Thank you,
Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member, for this important hearing,
one of four.
Let me follow up on Senator Brown's line of questioning. Do
any of you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
administration? If we could start ``yes'' or ``no'' to the
right here.
Dr. Brandicourt. No.
Dr. Bourla. No.
Mr. Frazier. Spend more on R&D versus marketing?
Senator Cortez Masto. More in R&D than you spend on
marketing and administration. Do you invest more in R&D than
you do on marketing?
Mr. Frazier. On marketing, but not if you include general
administration, facilities, and all of that stuff. But yes,
more than marketing.
Senator Cortez Masto. Okay.
Dr. Bourla. I would correct my answer also if it is only
marketing. Yes, we spend more on R&D.
Senator Cortez Masto. Let us just do marketing.
Dr. Brandicourt [indicating agreement with Dr. Bourla].
Ms. Taubert. Yes, we spend 86 percent more on R&D than we
do on sales and marketing.
Senator Cortez Masto. Okay.
Dr. Caforio. Yes, we do more on R&D.
Mr. Soriot. Same, more than marketing, but excluding
administrative costs.
Mr. Gonzalez. Significantly more in R&D than sales and
marketing.
Senator Cortez Masto. But if you included administration
with the marketing, that would be the reverse. Is that correct?
Mr. Gonzalez. That is correct.
Senator Cortez Masto. Yes from the rest of you?
Mr. Frazier. It is about tied at Merck.
Senator Cortez Masto. Okay.
So let me just ask this question. Apart from New Zealand,
nowhere else in the world will you see drug ads on television--
and I have asked this question for some of you. My
understanding is--the answer that I have been given is that you
maintain that television ads are a critical public health tool
that helps patients identify their symptoms and seek treatment.
Would you all agree with that? Is that a ``yes''? ``No''?
Why do we have television ads when it----
Dr. Brandicourt. Yes, you are right.
Senator Cortez Masto. Is that why? Is that a ``yes''?
Dr. Brandicourt. Yes.
Dr. Bourla. Yes.
Mr. Frazier. Yes.
Ms. Taubert. Yes.
Dr. Caforio. Yes.
Mr. Soriot. Yes.
Mr. Gonzalez. Yes.
Senator Cortez Masto. Okay. So if you maintain that
television ads are a critical public health tool, then how can
that be if our health outcomes are not significantly better
than in those countries where it is outlawed?
Dr. Bourla. Thank you, and you are raising a very good
point.
I think that the health-care outcomes and life expectancy--
there are a lot of factors that influence them. For example,
exercise, diet, lifestyle, and I feel that our Nation needs to
improve a lot in many of these cases. But I can assure you,
Senator, that if you get cancer or another serious disease, you
want to be treated in this country.
Senator Cortez Masto. Okay.
Dr. Bourla. There is no comparison.
Senator Cortez Masto. All right. So let me jump back then
to this discussion on authorized generics. And I am trying to
understand this, I think, along with all of my colleagues, to
address how we reduce the cost and get the drugs in the hands
of the people who need them--where the R&D came in, where they
were created--for individuals who actually need the drugs.
I want to ask about the concept of authorized generics.
Those, as you know, are the drugs that are identical to the
brand, manufactured by the brand, but marketed without the
brand on its label.
Yet the companies, my understanding is, keep selling the
higher-cost brand drug to consumers who, according to press
reports, do not realize that the same product from the same
company is available at a better price.
All of you manufacture authorized generics to maintain your
market share once your patent expires. Is that true?
Dr. Brandicourt. No.
Senator Cortez Masto. That is not true?
Dr. Bourla. We do have authorized generics.
Dr. Brandicourt. We do have authorized generics, but do not
do it with the goal that you just highlighted.
Senator Cortez Masto. So you do have authorized generics?
Do all of you have authorized generics?
Mr. Frazier. For some brands.
Senator Cortez Masto. Okay.
Ms. Taubert. Very selectively.
Dr. Caforio. Very selectively.
Mr. Soriot. We do not.
Senator Cortez Masto. You do not?
Mr. Gonzalez. I do not believe we do.
Senator Cortez Masto. You do not have authorized generics?
So for those of you who have authorized generics, explain to
me, if you do have those, why do you continue selling the
brand?
Mr. Frazier. Okay, so in our case when we have had
authorized generics, we have allowed a third-party to bring a
generic product to market. The issue that you are really
getting to, again, is the issue that Senator Cassidy talked
about, which is transparency.
At the end of the day, if patients really understood what
their options were, they would not make these choices. But we
have an opaque system, which is something that I think we have
to change. We have to empower patients to be able to choose the
cheapest medication. And Merck strongly supports generics.
What I said in my introduction is, we will never use
coupons when there is a generic.
Senator Cortez Masto. What are you doing to empower the
patients? What are you doing to empower the patients to
understand that the generics are out there?
Mr. Frazier. It is very hard. We do not connect with the
patients in all those situations. That is why there is
legislation saying, for example, that pharmacists must tell
patients at the counter what the cheapest alternative is for
them at the counter. We do not----
Senator Cortez Masto. So you rely on others to tell----
Mr. Frazier. Yes. We do not meet them at the counter,
Senator.
Senator Cortez Masto. Okay. Let me ask one final question,
because I am running out of time here. I want to get a sense
from all of you what types of policies you could support. I
have heard some of those, but let me ask you this. Democrats
have proposed to require manufacturers to submit advanced
justification for price hikes that outpace inflation and make
that information public.
Given that many of you have already committed to tapering
price hikes, is this something you could support, ``yes'' or
``no''?
Dr. Brandicourt. We can support such legislation, yes.
Dr. Bourla. Yes.
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you.
Dr. Caforio. Yes.
Ms. Taubert. We are very supportive of increased pricing
transparency. Advance notification can cause problems in the
supply chain and could cause outages for certain States. So we
are very supportive of the notion of transparency. Advance
notification can be problematic.
Senator Cortez Masto. Okay.
Dr. Caforio. We disclose our price increases.
Senator Cortez Masto. Okay.
Mr. Soriot. We support it.
Mr. Gonzalez. We support it, but we would like to see
consistency. As you probably know, California has that right
now, but if we had a consistent standard that we operated with,
that would certainly be helpful.
Senator Cortez Masto. Thank you. Thank you very much.
The Chairman. Senator Daines?
Senator Daines. It is very clear from what is going on
today that there are ultimately not any silver bullets to cure
the high cost of prescription drugs. I am pleased that we can
have this discussion. My hope is that we can truly find some
ways to incentivize the system here to deliver a lower price,
ultimately, for the consumer as well as incentivizing
innovation.
As manufacturers, you are responsible for setting this list
price, this ethereal list price. But the more I hear what is
going on here today, I am convinced we probably should call
this the asking price. I am sure ``list price'' is a bit of a
misnomer, because after hearing all about coupons, rebates,
discounts, the pricing volatility--yes, I spent 13 years at
Procter and Gamble, and once upon a time we drove a business
with a lot of coupons, with rebates, pricing incentives. It was
a very elastic pricing model. Oftentimes, we had a high-margin
business. There is elasticity in the pricing, and you are an
example of that.
I spent 12 years in the cloud computing business after
that. The margins were even higher. We saw great volatility in
pricing and elasticity in pricing. We eventually, years ago of
course, went to the everyday low price, EDLP, model. It, again,
may or may not apply to Pharma. But it was just trying to take
out all of that in between the manufacturer and the consumer
nonsense that was going on, that was lacking transparency.
And ultimately, I think the consumer was not winning in
that equation, because the prices--they were not seeing really
the true everyday low price. There are a lot of perverse
incentives in the system today, as best I can tell. So my
question is, who pays list price?
Dr. Brandicourt. Unfortunately, the patient at the end, at
the pharmacy counter, is probably one of the few paying the
list price.
Mr. Frazier. There is a small percentage of people who have
no insurance who could actually be charged the list price.
Senator Daines. So the people who can afford it the least,
arguably, are paying list price.
Mr. Frazier. Senator, that to me is what I meant by saying,
in some ways the reimbursement system here is regressive. The
people who can least afford it are paying the most.
Senator Daines. Do you think that that is a good system?
Mr. Frazier. I do not. I can tell you that is, to me, the
biggest problem that we have as a country, that we now have a
system where the poorest and the sickest are subsidizing
others.
Senator Daines. Okay. So with insurance companies that now
own the PBMs and the supply chain from the time you list the
price until the consumer eventually gets it, is it fair to say
the list price is really a starting point for, then, a
negotiation?
Mr. Frazier. Yes.
Senator Daines. Does anybody disagree with that premise?
Ms. Taubert. No.
Senator Daines. So what are some of the incentives? And
maybe we will start with Mr. Frazier. What are the incentives
that contribute to high list prices that are being paid by
those who can afford them least?
Mr. Frazier. The real answer, Senator, is, if you went back
a few years ago when we negotiated to get our drugs on
formulary, our goal was to have the lowest copay for patients.
Today the goal is to pay into the supply chain the biggest
rebate. And so that actually puts the patient at a
disadvantage, since they are the only ones who are paying a
portion of the list price. The list price is actually working
against the patient.
Senator Daines. So why do we have a system today where you
all are setting--I will just say very very high list prices,
which is our starting point for negotiation? Why?
Dr. Brandicourt. Senator, we are trying to get formulary
position with those high list prices, high rebates. It is a
preferred position. Unfortunately, the preferred position does
not automatically ensure affordability at the end of the day.
Mr. Frazier. And, Senator, if you bring a product to the
market with a low list price in this system, you get punished
financially and you get no uptake, because everyone in the
supply chain makes money as a result of a higher list price.
Senator Daines. Chairman Grassley, if I could just ask a
follow-up question here. And that is, the GAO report said that
generics might fall 20 percent for each new generic entrant
into the market.
I appreciate the chairman's efforts here with the CREATES
Act. It is going to crack down on some of these bad actors who
block or delay competing generic drugs from entering the
market. I have co-sponsored the bill, and I think that will
help us provide better access to low-cost generics.
Here is my question: has your company ever withheld samples
from generic manufacturers?
Dr. Brandicourt. No.
Dr. Bourla. No.
Mr. Frazier. No.
Ms. Taubert. No.
Dr. Caforio. No.
Mr. Soriot. No.
Mr. Gonzalez. No.
Senator Daines. Right. Do you believe the CREATES Act would
be a positive step forward, ensuring generics enter the market
in a timely fashion? I would love to poll the team here.
Mr. Frazier. I said in my testimony, legislation like the
CREATES Act would be positive in that regard.
Dr. Bourla. Yes.
Dr. Brandicourt. Yes.
Dr. Caforio. Yes.
Mr. Soriot. Yes.
Mr. Gonzalez. We are supportive.
Ms. Taubert. We are supportive of efforts to make sure that
there are no abuses of that sample system.
Senator Daines. All right; I am out a time now. Thank you.
The Chairman. Senator Young?
Senator Young. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I want to move to the issue of Medicaid best price. In the
Trump administration's blueprint, they suggest that because
drug manufacturers have to give Medicaid the best price drugs,
there is no incentive to offer deeper discounts to other
payers, both government and commercial, than what is already
offered under the Medicaid drug rebate program.
So first of all, I would ask each of you, is the Trump
administration's assessment accurate?
Mr. Gonzalez. In concept, I would say I understand the
concept. In other words, if you have best price, you obviously
have to be conscious of where that price is going, because it
is going to be compared against that.
I would tell you in practice, because of the negotiation
that occurs in the formula around Medicaid, I do not believe
that that is actually, today, resulting in higher prices in the
Medicare program.
Senator Young. You have anticipated my follow-up question.
So I appreciate that.
So the best price requirement does not encourage
manufacturers to increase initial prices? You have thoughts on
that?
Mr. Gonzalez. I would say it does not necessarily encourage
you to set a higher list price. I think what happens with list
price is this negotiation you have heard of, going forward,
where you are looking for a certain amount of impact to fall
through, but the rebates and the other aspects of the value
chain in between absorb a large chunk of that, which drives
list prices, increases up higher.
Senator Young. Okay. Others?
Mr. Frazier. I think where best price really is an issue
is, again, it is a barrier to the kind of value-based pricing
that we want to have within the marketplace, where if, for
example, a drug did not work, you might reimburse that payer
for that unit, where that becomes a problem for value-based
pricing.
Dr. Brandicourt. Another example, Senator, is when you want
to put on the market a second NDC, like we did recently where
it had a much lower list price, then the best price potentially
becomes a problem because it is calculated with the other
version, the higher list price version, which has stayed on the
market. So that is something to pay attention to.
Senator Young. What changes, if any--if I could pivot a
bit--would you suggest making to the program?
Dr. Caforio. Senator, I believe that flexibility with
value-based arrangements is really important, because I think
we have all expressed a strong support for a system where we
are paid based on the clinical results that our medicines
produce in patients and having greater flexibility to do that.
It would be very, very important. It would be very valuable
for patients. It would reduce health-care costs overall.
Senator Young. General agreement?
Ms. Taubert. Yes, we agree.
Mr. Frazier. Yes.
Senator Young. Okay.
So would you be willing to work with the administration on
a different model, one you regard as more optimal?
Ms. Taubert. Absolutely.
Senator Young. Very good. Thank you.
With respect to reducing drug prices and the subsidies that
U.S. payers provide with respect to research and development to
much of the rest of the wealthy world, the President and the
administration have gone so far as to issue proposals, like the
international pricing index, which we all are familiar with, to
bring down prescription drug prices.
So with the increased scrutiny of the industry and of the
drug supply chain as a whole in the U.S., have any of your
companies re-evaluated your business strategy in foreign
countries?
Mr. Frazier. That is a common question that we get asked.
And the answer to that question is, we do everything in our
power to ensure that there is less freeloading by governments
outside the United States. But the reality of the world is, the
greatest opportunity we have is to walk away.
And that is really challenging when you have the kinds of
essential medicines that make a big difference to people's
lives. And frankly, they know that. They know that they can
establish a price, and that ultimately what we have is an
option to walk away, leaving patients behind.
I would also make the point that has been made several
times here, that in the course of negotiating for
reimbursement, often those countries take a very deliberate
approach, such that these medicines are available many years
later than they are here.
So they not only negotiate on a low price, but they
actually provide very few of these medicines early on to their
populations. If you look at, for example, lung cancer, where in
this country now, there is data showing that certain medicines
can reduce the risk of death by 50 percent in newly diagnosed
lung cancer patients, compare that to the UK, where people die
regularly of lung cancer because they do not have these
medicines.
Mr. Soriot. Senator, I think it is important to keep in
mind that all these investments, number one, create a lot of
very good jobs in the U.S. and economic value that really
benefits the country. And second, they allow patients to get
access to important new medicines much, much, much earlier than
in Europe, for instance, sometimes 3, 4 years before.
And I share Mr. Frazier's comment here. I have many
examples that I could share where medicines that save lives are
available here. We are still waiting in Europe.
The Chairman. Just three more questions. One from--if some
of you want to answer yet, I did not mean to interrupt you. Go
ahead.
Mr. Gonzalez. The only thing I would add is, if we could
develop a model where, as in the early days of HIV when
countries ultimately shared the burden, knowing that you would
have to provide HIV treatments at a very low cost in certain
countries, there was a tiered pricing system that came through
where, yes, the U.S. paid the highest price, but the Europeans
paid a fairly significant price for very important specialty
medicines. If we could negotiate through trade or other
mechanisms, we would be able to get a more balanced sharing of
the investment that is made, not keeping all of that burden on
the U.S., because the U.S. does bear the bulk of the burden of
innovation in our business. That is absolutely true.
Senator Young. So that is a really interesting idea. If you
or your team are aware of any academic paper you might bring to
my attention----
The Chairman. Okay. That is the end.
Senator Young. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Yes.
Now we have three questions, one from Senator Wyden, then
Senator Cassidy, then me. And then that will be it.
Senator Wyden. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
This is going to be one question and then a very brief
closer. And the question is for you, Mr. Gonzalez.
I have the company's proxy statement here. And financial
disclosures show that you were paid $22.6 million in 2017, and
that included a $4.3-million bonus. That is what I want to look
at.
On page 37 in this proxy statement, it says your bonus was
tied to the financial performance of Humira. And it seems that
was the case in 2015 and 2016. That strikes me as problematic,
since AbbVie reported that the higher prices in the U.S. were
responsible for increasing sales of Humira.
Would you make a smaller bonus if you dropped the price of
Humira?
Mr. Gonzalez. Humira was one element of a set of financial
factors that were evaluated as part of my compensation. It is
obviously a very significant product for us. So it is clear
that it would be a part of that evaluation.
Senator Wyden. I would like that in writing. It looks to me
like you would be making a smaller bonus if you dropped the
price of Humira. I would like that in writing within 10 days.
My last point--Mr. Chairman, I appreciate being able to do
this for a closer--is that I have heard a lot of happy talk
this morning, things like, well, if you get rid of rebates,
drug prices are going to go down. But what people are taking
away from this hearing is--I have seen it said and reported--
well, no firm commitments have been made to lower list prices.
So I am just going to tell you what I would like in writing
is, I would like an answer in writing to the question, if
rebates go away, will you support a black letter law that
requires that you reduce list prices by the amount of the
rebate?
I am going to get that to you right away. I would like an
answer within 10 days, because that is right at the heart of
this issue, and after the ``happy talk'' is over, that is what
is really going to help people at pharmacy counters from sea to
shining sea.
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
The Chairman. Senator Cassidy?
Senator Cassidy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank you, again. This has been incredibly provocative. And
if there is a tension here, the tension is, how do we support
innovation, but at the same time make it that the patient can
afford that innovation?
Mr. Frazier, you may have guessed that--it seems like we
have a mirror image, in my mind. Either the plans impose a
price or the government imposes a price. But either way, the
side having it imposed upon them is not very wild about that.
And you just mentioned to Todd Young that you can walk
away. If France offers you too low a price, you just walk away
from France. The UK does not have a deal right now. But in some
areas, Medicare cannot walk away. So it is back to that mirror
image. And you started to say something and I was out of time.
But my question is, in the six protected classes--and if there
is a new drug, like Sovaldi was at the beginning, right now the
commercials can walk away, the commercials can delay, but
Medicare cannot.
So help me resolve this. How do we give the patient, the
taxpayer, the same sort of tools that--and by the way, CBO says
unless you can walk away, negotiations will not lower prices.
Mr. Frazier. So my point was, for all practical purposes,
we cannot walk away from our European colleagues, even though
they give us low prices, because we think it would be immoral
to leave those patients----
Senator Cassidy. Now some of your colleagues have, because
there are drugs not yet available in the UK.
Mr. Frazier. Well, the problem with the UK is that they
delay. Just like they can set the price, they delay when they
put the drug on the market. It is the UK's delay, it is not our
delay. So I want to clarify that point.
But coming back to your six protected classes, those
protected classes are there because many, many sick vulnerable
people need medicines in those classes. And we believe that
there are ways of lowering the prices, stimulating innovation,
without violating the compact that was around those six
protected classes, because patients are particularly needing
those medicines.
Senator Cassidy. Well, we will have to leave it there, but
I am not sure that is--you know, that seems almost status quo.
And status quo is kind of not working.
But again, thank you all very much, and I thank you again
for your innovation.
Dr. Bourla. I would add, Senator, I believe the
administration should try, through trade agreements, to protect
the American innovation, because by and large the
pharmaceutical innovation is happening in this country. And
right now, I think rightly, these price control mechanisms are
for multiple well-developed countries. It is in reality free-
riding on American innovation.
Senator Cassidy. Okay.
Well, thank you.
The Chairman. My last question is very general, but I would
like to know if there are any policies affecting Medicaid or
Medicare that are in your control to change? In other words,
from the company level, is there anything in your control that
you could change on Medicare or Medicaid?
I will start with you on my right here.
Dr. Brandicourt. I do not think we can change directly any
policy, Senator, on Medicare or Medicaid. We can talk about
different solutions, but I do not think we can change. We have
no power to change.
The Chairman. But if you lowered your list price, it would
help. That is one thing you could do.
Dr. Brandicourt. If we were able to lower our list price,
that would certainly help, again, the patient at the end, at
the pharmacy, to have a copay which they could afford.
However, we could not do that independently of a major
reform because we would lose formulary placement if we were
doing that in isolation, and especially in very competitive
areas where you do have, you know, brands and generics. And
again, I am referring to the insulin market, which has become
extremely, extremely competitive. That would not work.
The Chairman. Do you have anything?
Dr. Bourla. Mr. Chairman, I think the most impactful thing
I can do right now it is to make the pledge that, as leader of
this company, Pfizer, I would be taking very seriously the
responsible pricing of our products. This is something that we
have already started.
Pricing at Pfizer in the past was growing in the mid-single
digits, even more in some cases. This is not something that we
continued doing. Pricing at Pfizer went down last year, went
down this year.
And when I spoke to our investors, not to the Senate, to
our investors, I made it very clear that pricing will not be a
growth driver for this company now or in the years to come. Why
do I think this is the most important? Because I think the tone
is set from the top.
The Chairman. Mr. Frazier?
Mr. Frazier. Senator, I understand the dissatisfaction with
our industry. I understand why patients are frustrated, because
they need these medicines and they cannot afford them.
I would pledge to do everything that we could, but I would
urge you to recognize that the system itself is complex, and it
is interdependent. And no one company can unilaterally lower
list prices without running into financial and operating
disadvantages that make it impossible to do that. But if we
bring all the parties together around the table with the goal
of doing what is best for the patient, I think we can come up
with a system that works for all Americans.
Thank you for giving us the time today.
The Chairman. I did not mean to--for the rest of you,
before you answer, I did not mean to say list price. I just
said, well, that is kind of obvious. Yes, I did not want to
concentrate just on that.
Ms. Taubert?
Ms. Taubert. We really want to be a part of the solution,
and we want patients to be able to access and pay for the
medicines that they so desperately need. So we do strongly
advocate for rebate reforms that would allow us to lower our
list prices that would then end up helping patients get access.
The Chairman. Dr. Caforio?
Dr. Caforio. Mr. Chairman, I would echo. Our perspective is
that it starts with a very responsible and thoughtful approach
to pricing and price increases. That is what Bristol-Myers
Squibb does.
The second point that I would like to make is that, today
we have discussed a number of very concrete policies, from
addressing the issue of rebates to value-based pricing to
supporting the development of a generic and biosimilar market.
And you have my commitment that our company is looking forward
to working with this committee and the administration to make
sure that many of those policies can be enacted, because they
would make a very big difference for our patients.
The Chairman. Mr. Soriot?
Mr. Soriot. Senator, we actually cannot influence policy.
What we can do is, indeed, apply reasonable pricing and also
continue pushing for value-based pricing. But I would like to
make a general comment, which is that hopefully--you know,
hopefully my colleagues will share this. This view is that I
really do not think we are blaming anybody in the system. In
his introduction, Senator Wyden thought that we were placing
the blame on PBMs and others. I really do not think we are
doing this.
I think what it is is that we are in a system that used to
be fit for purpose and really drove enormous savings over the
last few years but is no longer fit for purpose. And it is one
of those situations where nobody in the system can do anything,
can fix it by themselves. The government has to step up and
change the rules, and those rebates have to go.
The Chairman. Mr. Gonzalez?
Mr. Gonzalez. I think I would agree with many of the points
that were already raised. We as an industry have to continue to
do everything we can to be responsible about pricing in both
how we set pricing and price increases over time. I think we
have seen a positive trend in that area. But ultimately, the
final fixes here to realign the system appropriately would
require legislative-type changes.
The only other thing I would say is, as I mentioned a
moment ago, we are absolutely committed that no patient goes
without medicine of ours that they need. And we have an
extensive patient assistance program, but we are talking about
how we more broadly ensure all patients understand they can get
that support from us if they cannot afford their medicines.
The Chairman. I want to inform all members of the committee
that I will set a deadline of March 12th if you have questions
you want to submit to the panel for answers in writing. And
then for you folks, after you get those questions, I hope you
can get back to us very quickly.
And so, all of the people besides the witnesses who have
attended either here or off-site for this hearing, I thank you
for your interest in this issue. And I want to once again thank
our witnesses for being here today and sharing your knowledge
and expertise. And I indicated that this is the start of a
dialogue I hope to have with you so that we can correct some of
these things that have been pointed out at this committee
meeting that we think need to be corrected.
Thank you all very much.
Meeting adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 1:25 p.m., the hearing was concluded.]
A P P E N D I X
Additional Material Submitted for the Record
----------
Prepared Statement of Albert Bourla, DVM, Ph.D.,
Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer
Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the
committee, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today. My
name is Albert Bourla. I have been with Pfizer for 26 years, and just
last month had the honor of becoming its chief executive officer.
Today, I am pleased to take part in such an important policy
discussion within the United States Senate. Pfizer shares an important
goal with this committee: to ensure that America remains the leader
when it comes to innovative medicines, and that our citizens have
affordable access to these modern miracles when they need them.
In that frightening moment when you hear that you or a loved one
has been diagnosed with a serious disease, one question comes to mind:
``Is there a cure or treatment available?'' The answer can change your
life. And happily, the answer to that question increasingly is ``yes.''
Breakthrough medicines are coming quickly across a wide range of
conditions. Most of them are discovered here, by the American
Biopharmaceutical Industry, which is the crown jewel of innovation. Let
me share a few examples. In 2015, Pfizer launched a life-changing new
treatment for metastatic breast cancer that can delay the progression
of the disease two times longer than previous treatments. Thanks to our
meningitis B vaccine, parents can send their teens to college confident
in the knowledge that being vaccinated helps protect them in the event
of an outbreak on campus. In 2018, we brought 4 new cancer treatments
to the market to treat varying forms of breast cancer, lung cancer and
leukemia. And we are currently working on a non-opioid alternative with
the potential to address the serious unmet needs of the more than 27
million Americans living with osteoarthritis and the more than 33
million suffering chronic low back pain.
But all of these breakthroughs won't do anyone any good if patients
can't afford them.
That's why at Pfizer we are so committed to our purpose:
breakthroughs that change patients' lives. Pfizer's more than 90,000
colleagues around the world come to work every day focused not only on
creating breakthrough medicines, but also on making sure those
medicines get into the hands of the patients who need them.
To create solutions that make medicines affordable for patients and
our entire health-care system, I believe that all players in the
industry must come together and play a part. Whether it's hospitals or
providers, pharmacy benefit managers or insurance companies, or
biopharmaceutical companies, we all have a role to play. The series of
hearings being held by Congress can be a catalyst for this much-
needed collaboration.
There are two indisputable truths that make this the exact right
moment for change:
1.
Medicines alleviate human suffering and reduce overall
system costs.
2.
The horribly misaligned incentives within our health-care
system often prevent medicines from getting into the hands of
patients.
Our health-care system is broken, and we need to fix it. The system
needs to be simpler and more transparent. It needs to incentivize
innovation while simultaneously ensuring access. Simply put, it needs
to put patients--and their health--first.
How will we know when the health-care system is fixed? When
patients feel real relief at the pharmacy counter--the kind of relief
that means cost will no longer be a determining factor in whether
someone picks up, and adheres to, their prescription. Too often,
Americans are forced to choose between buying a medication that will
improve, extend or save their lives or paying their bills. Too often,
they fill their prescriptions, but take less than the prescribed dose
in an effort to save money. Too often, lower-cost, FDA-approved generic
and biosimilar alternatives are not made available to patients who
desperately need them.
We must take bold actions to ensure these scenarios do not play out
time and time again across America.
Pfizer intends to be a productive participant in this policy making
and has come to the table with solutions. As such, we would like to
propose four ideas to drive meaningful reductions in costs for
patients.
passing all rebates to patients
Today's current drug rebate system is good for two things: driving
up both drug list prices and consumer out-of-pocket costs. In fact, in
2018, the average net price of Pfizer's medicines in the United States
declined 1 percent. However, I am certain that patients using our
medicines had a very different experience at the pharmacy counter since
their costs in the current system are more closely related to the list
price than the net price. This is impactful when patients pay a
coinsurance or are in the deductible phase of their benefits coverage.
In these instances, patients are being asked to pay an average of 10
percent to 20 percent or more out of their own pockets for many Pfizer
products.
There are two reasons for this disconnect: changes in benefit
designs are pushing more and more of the medicines' cost to the pockets
of the patients, and none of the close to $12 billion of rebates that
Pfizer paid in 2018 found their way to American patients. As long as
rebates serve as profit drivers, we will continue to see a major
disconnect between list prices and prices people pay at the counter.
Pfizer supports reforms that would create a system in which
transparent, up-front discounts benefit patients at the pharmacy
counter, rather than a system driven by rebates that are swallowed up
by companies in the supply chain.
The way to alleviate sticker shock at the pharmacy counter is by
changing the incentives in the supply chain so that more of the $150
billion in negotiated rebates and discounts actually reach patients.
This can be accomplished by applying the discounts paid by the
pharmaceutical manufacturer to the price actually paid by patients at
the pharmacy. In 2019, Pfizer expects to pay billions in rebates to
ensure patients with pharmacy benefits coverage in Medicare Part D and
patients in commercial plans have access to our medicines. If the
proposed rule to share rebates with consumers at the point of sale is
finalized, we estimate that seniors taking Pfizer medicines could save
$270 on average per year, and up to $574 per year for certain Pfizer
medicines, through lower cost sharing--and that would outweigh any
premium increases.
Research also shows that sharing discounts at the pharmacy counter
could reduce total health-care spending, and that reductions in overall
out-of-pocket costs would outweigh any premium increases.
We realize that the transition away from rebates toward a point-of-
sale discount model will result in a lowering of our net prices.
Despite this potential negative financial impact, we support efforts to
eliminate rebates because we believe the new model will be good for
patients.
Importantly, we believe any reform should apply to all market
segments as this will also lead to further reduction in list prices. A
bifurcated market in which we eliminate rebates in government programs
but maintain rebates for commercial plans will make it difficult for
manufacturers to reduce list prices because it applies to all markets.
We will work with other leaders in the healthcare sector to advance
these reforms, and we're committed to lowering list prices if the
rebate rule applies to the commercial market.
less value, less pay
Pfizer supports the move to value-based health care and is prepared
to stand behind the benefits that our medicines deliver to patients and
to the United States health-care system.
Medical science is advancing so rapidly that payment models simply
haven't been able to keep up. That's why Pfizer is focusing not only on
scientific innovation, but also on commercial innovations that will
allow us to get breakthrough medicines into the hands of patients,
while simultaneously holding all participants in the system--including
Pfizer--accountable for the health outcomes they help produce.
This will require a fundamental shift in the way we think about the
value that medicines deliver and how all participants in the system are
reimbursed with regard to that value. It will also require the
evolution of insurance designs to advance value-based insurance plans
that removebarriers to high-value treatments.
Imagine a system in which hospitals are rewarded for keeping
patients from being readmitted; where physicians get paid more to
prevent disease than they do to simply treat it; and where companies
like Pfizer get paid based on the number of strokes we prevent or the
number of cancer patients who go into full remission, rather than the
number of pills we sell.
In such a system, if our medicines do not produce results, we would
be paid less. And if they do produce results, we would be paid more. If
done correctly, these arrangements--focused on the appropriate
therapeutic areas--can align the interests of patients, health plans
and biopharmaceutical companies around one shared goal: ensuring
positive health outcomes for the patient.
To make this a reality, we need Congress's help to remove the
roadblocks in the current system for the good of patients. I understand
several members of this committee are drafting a legislative effort to
pave the way for broader adoption of outcomes-based arrangements, and
we applaud these efforts.
capping seniors' out-of-pocket medicine costs
Patients are increasingly being required to take on a bigger share
of their medicines' costs, and that is particularly true when it comes
to innovative and expensive treatments. Today, patients are made to pay
on average 14 percent of the cost of their medicines, but only 3
percent of the costs associated with hospital stays.
This is forcing patients to forgo taking needed medications, to cut
their pills in half, or to limit their doses in ways that are not
medically prescribed. In fact, there is evidence that at least a
quarter of new Medicare Part D prescriptions are abandoned at the
pharmacy counter if beneficiaries are asked to pay $50 or more, which
unfortunately is often the case. This number can exceed 50 percent for
new prescriptions.
This is bad not only for patients, but also for overall health-care
system cost. Patients who do not take their medications often end up in
the hospital, costing the health-care system much more. This needs to
be fixed.
Excessive cost-sharing is one of the greatest barriers to patient
adherence and leads to more frequent discontinuation of therapy. While
spending on medicines has been growing at a slower rate than in prior
years, the number of patients with high deductible plans and high co-
insurance are growing rapidly. Since 2009, enrollment in high
deductible plans has grown 250 percent, and since 2010 the number of
patients exposed to high specialty tiers has grown 60 percent. In fact,
I've heard from several members of this committee that their
constituents--or they themselves--have recently gone to the pharmacy
counter only to be shocked by an excessively high co-pay. That's why
the time is now to review cost-sharing burdens in the Medicare
prescription drug program and to take steps to ensure seniors don't
have to make the difficult decision of forgoing their needed
prescription.
We commit to working with the committee on meaningful policy
solutions that remove the burdens seniors face in paying for their
medicines, and we believe an important first step is capping the out-
of-pocket costs seniors experience in the Medicare drug program.
knocking down barriers to lower-cost biosimilars
Medicines are the only segment of the health-care system with a
built-in cost containment mechanism. When a medicine's patent expires,
lower-cost generics are made available, often at just 5 percent of the
cost of the original branded product.
This system is working well for generic drugs. In fact, nine out of
10 drugs sold in the U.S. today are lower-cost generics. However, the
system is not yet working in the biologics space where the adoption of
biosimilars is facing resistance.
Establishing a robust biosimilars market can help to lower the
overall health-care costs in the United States, and Pfizer is committed
to bringing these more affordable treatment options to patients. That's
why we must incentivize the use of biosimilars, which can be as much as
40 percent less expensive than the branded biologic for Medicare
patients.
Unfortunately, adverse incentives that favor higher-cost originator
biologics are keeping biosimilars from reaching patients. In many
cases, payers decline to include lower-cost biosimilars or generics in
their formularies because they would risk losing the rebates they can
get by covering higher-cost medicines. I can't think of a more
concerning example of a broken U.S. healthcare system that is directly
impacting the pocketbooks of Americans.
We have also witnessed exclusionary contracting or misleading
marketing practices that mischaracterize important elements of
biosimilar criteria. This creates doubt and confusion among patients,
and it must end. Interestingly, the rebate reform I referenced earlier
would go a long way toward removing the perverse incentives that lead
to such exclusionary contracts.
At Pfizer, we believe there are several solutions that could help
patients and providers share savings associated with biosimilars and
reduce costs to the Medicare program. Let me touch on two:

A Shared Savings Biosimilars Model: Congress could direct
the CMS Innovation Center (CMMI) to test a biosimilar ``shared
savings'' approach in which Medicare savings associated with
prescribing a biosimilar, as compared to a reference
biological, would be shared with providers.

Reduced Patient Cost Sharing for Biosimilars: CMS could
provide reduced or zero-dollar cost sharing for biosimilars for
patients for a certain period.
closing
In 2018, we estimate \1\ that Pfizer vaccines protected more than
65 million babies and elderly patients; our medicines helped reduce the
risk of heart attack or stroke for more than 48 million cardiovascular
patients; and oncologists used our therapies to treat more than 1.2
million people battling cancer.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Patient counts are estimates derived from multiple data
sources.
Overall more than 784 million people around the world used a Pfizer
medicine or vaccine to improve their health and, in many cases, save
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
their lives.
These are staggering and humbling numbers. More important, they
represent real people; real people who rely on our innovations. They
also serve as a reminder that we--like our industry peers--are among
the biggest contributors of good to humanity.
This is why we come to work every day. It's why the researchers in
our labs in California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York work
day-in and day-out to perfect a formula. It's why our manufacturing
colleagues in Georgia, Kansas, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina,
Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin--many of whom are represented by
members of this committee--work to ensure the reliable supply and
highest standards of quality of our products.
And it's why we are here today to work with our peers, other
participants in the healthcare system, and Congress to find ways to
ensure the patients who need our medicines can access them so our
industry's breakthroughs can continue to change patients' lives.
______
Questions Submitted for the Record to Albert Bourla, DVM, Ph.D.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
Question. At the hearing, you testified that Pfizer does not
withhold samples from generic manufacturers in order to block generic
versions of your drug from entering the market. You also expressed your
support for the ``Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent
Samples Act,'' also known as the CREATES Act.
However, the FDA has a list on its website which identifies
reference listed drug (RLD) access inquiries where brand manufacturers
may have prevented generic companies from obtaining samples of products
necessary to support FDA approval. Pfizer is on this FDA list. This
would appear to contradict your testimony at the hearing that Pfizer
has not withheld samples of their products to delay generic
competition.

Could you please explain in detail why Pfizer is on the FDA
list?

Could you please explain in detail the discrepancy between
your testimony and the FDA list?

Has Pfizer ever blocked access to samples?
Answer. As a patient-focused company and leading manufacturer of
innovative, generic, and biosimilar medicines, Pfizer supports
innovation and a strong, competitive marketplace. Consistent with these
values, Pfizer does not block generic manufacturers from purchasing our
products, and it has never been our policy to do so. Generic
manufacturers are treated the same as any other customer seeking to
purchase our products. Pfizer is not aware of any current, unfulfilled
requests from a generic manufacturer to purchase a Pfizer product.
Generic manufacturers seeking to purchase Pfizer products should
request the product from Pfizer's authorized distributors or, if the
product is not available at a distributor, from Pfizer directly, the
same as any other Pfizer customers. Pfizer's website includes a list of
our authorized distributors, from which customers (including generic
companies) may purchase most Pfizer products (see https://www.
pfizer.com/products/medicine-distributors). For products that are not
available via our authorized distributors and that are not in extreme
drug shortage or unavailable due to a recall, customers can contact
Pfizer's Customer Service center at 1-800-TRY-FIRST (1-800-879-3477) to
purchase product directly from Pfizer. The telephone number for
Pfizer's Customer Service center is also included on our website at
https://www.pfizer.com/contact. Pfizer makes its products available for
sale to appropriately licensed entities at Pfizer's listed price and on
Pfizer's standard terms of sale. We do not have any agreements with
authorized distributors that block the sale of Pfizer's products to
generic manufacturers.
Regarding the FDA List (the List), while Pfizer supports FDA's (the
agency) goal of providing transparency, Pfizer is concerned that the
List lacks certain key information and context and, as currently
presented, may create the misleading impression that all products on
the List are the result of bad faith attempts to block generic
manufacturer access to samples. The appearance of a product on the FDA
List means only that a generic manufacturer informed the agency at some
point in time that it was having difficulty purchasing the listed
product. FDA's own disclaimer states that the agency has not
independently investigated or confirmed whether a generic manufacturer
actually made a request to purchase product, and to whom.\1\ The FDA
List also lacks several important pieces of information that would
enable a New Drug Application (NDA) holder to investigate its
appearance on the List. The List does not include: (1) which generic
manufacturer made the request; (2) when and to whom the generic
manufacturer made the request (e.g., to a wholesaler or directly to the
NDA holder); (3) whether the generic manufacturer that made the inquiry
was thereafter able to obtain product; and (4) any reason(s) why a
generic manufacturer may not have been able to obtain product (e.g., a
recall). Finally, Pfizer notes that FDA does not currently inform an
NDA holder in real time when a generic manufacturer notifies the agency
that it is having difficulty obtaining product. Had the agency informed
Pfizer at the time it received the inquiries noted on the FDA List,
Pfizer could have then undertaken its own efforts to resolve the issue.
Pfizer communicated its concerns about the FDA List to the agency in
May 2018. For your information we have included Pfizer's letter to FDA
on this topic and the agency's response (see Exhibits 1 and 2 in the
Appendix).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/
HowDrugsareDevelopedandAp
proved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/
ucm607738.htm).
There are three new drug applications owned by Pfizer on the FDA
List: Embeda (NDA 022321), Tikosyn (NDA 020931) and Hemabate (NDA
017989). Embeda offers a good example of the List's shortcomings.
Pfizer acquired King Pharmaceuticals (the previous NDA holder of
Embeda) in March 2011, and two weeks later determined that Embeda
needed to be recalled from the U.S. market due to stability issues.
After diligently addressing the issues that led to the recall, Pfizer
relaunched Embeda to the U.S. market in January 2015, and it is
available for purchase via Pfizer's authorized distributors. However,
one consequence of the recall was that Embeda was not available in the
U.S. market for almost 4 years which may explain why a generic
manufacturer had a problem obtaining it during those years. The FDA
List does not specify when the generic manufacturer's inquiry regarding
Embeda was made nor does the FDA List indicate that several generic
applications for Embeda had been submitted to FDA in 2010 (which means
that before the recall, several generic manufacturers were successfully
able to purchase Embeda, conduct the necessary testing, and file
Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)). Pfizer has not identified
any recent inquiries from generic manufacturers seeking to purchase
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Embeda that have not been fulfilled.
The circumstances around Tikosyn also illustrate the List's
shortcomings. Pfizer was able to identify a single inquiry made by a
generic manufacturer directly to Pfizer to purchase Tikosyn in 2014. At
that time, Tikosyn was subject to an FDA imposed Risk Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategies (REMS) with Elements to Assure Safe Use
(``ETASU'') that restricted distribution, so Pfizer responded by asking
the manufacturer to obtain written confirmation from the FDA that
Pfizer's provision of the product to the generic manufacturer would not
be considered a violation of its REMS. The generic manufacturer did not
contact Pfizer further, and Pfizer never received any written
correspondence from the agency. FDA subsequently removed the REMS for
Tikosyn in 2016, and multiple generic versions of Tikosyn are now
approved, the first generic approval occurring in June 2016. This
context is not reflected in FDA's List.
Finally, with respect to Hemabate, this product was previously
subject to certain restrictions on distribution (i.e., it was sold only
to customers with medical and surgical intensive care centers) to
ensure its safe and appropriate use. This distribution approach was
established by the previous NDA holder (Pharmacia) and it continued
following Pfizer's acquisition of Pharmacia in 2003. Pfizer
discontinued this approach in early 2018 after determining that it was
no longer necessary, and this product is now available through our
authorized distributors. During the time when Hemabate was under
restricted distribution, it was not available at Pfizer's authorized
distributors, but had a generic manufacturer approached Pfizer's
Customer Service center directly, we would have been able to address
the inquiry. Pfizer's Customer Service was not able to identify any
specific requests from a generic manufacturer to purchase Hemabate that
have not been fulfilled.
We hope that this information explains the apparent discrepancy
between Mr. Bourla's testimony and the appearance of these Pfizer
products on the FDA List, and demonstrates Pfizer's diligence on these
issues and commitment to a competitive marketplace.
Question. The Department of Health and Human Services' proposed
rule, ``Fraud and Abuse; Removal of Safe Harbor Protection for Rebates
Involving Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Creation of New Safe Harbor
Protection for Certain Point-of-Sale Reductions in Price on
Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Certain Pharmacy Benefit Manager
Service Fees,'' envisions that drug manufacturers will offer up-front
discounts rather than the back-end rebates that are now commonly
provided. Some observers argue that a 1996 court case called into
question whether manufacturers could offer up-front discounts,
resulting in today's rebate-based system. I've heard differing opinions
as to whether the issues related to the initial court case are still
relevant. If the HHS proposed rule is finalized, can you assure the
committee that your company will offer up-front discounts? If not, why?
Answer. Yes, if finalized, price concessions negotiated with
intermediaries, including Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and plan
sponsors, will be provided as discounts that will be applied at the
point of sale. These discounts will lower patient out-of-pocket costs
since the net price will be used to determine the cost to the patient
when they are in the deductible, co-insurance, and coverage gap phases
of their benefits.
Question. Please describe how you expect your company to respond to
the HHS proposed rule to eliminate safe harbor protection for back-end
rebates in Medicare Part D that is referenced above if it is finalized.
Assuming you are confident that antitrust laws do not prevent your
company from offering up-front discounts, specifically, do you envision
that your company lowers the list price of a drug to the current after-
rebate net price, offer discounts equal to the current rebate amount,
or a combination of both?
Answer. If finalized, the rule will result in lower out-of-pocket
patient costs at the pharmacy counter and help address the perverse
incentives in the system that have been contributing to higher list
prices for medicines. We realize that the transition away from rebates
toward a point-of-sale discount model will result in a lowering of our
net prices. Despite this potential negative financial impact, we
support efforts to eliminate rebates because we believe the new model
will be good for patients.
As currently written, the proposed rule only applies to the
Medicare and Medicaid managed care segments of the market. It will be
important to have any rebate reform apply to both government programs
and the commercial market as that will also lead to a lowering of list
prices as well. A bifurcated market will make it more challenging for
manufacturers to reduce list price since the commercial market covers
more than 50 percent of Americans with insurance and represents over
half of the business for most manufacturers.
If the proposed rule is modified to apply to all market segments,
we would evaluate the best options to arrive at a net price that
ensures patients have access to our medicines. Decisions would be made
on a product by product basis given that each therapeutic class has its
own set of competitive and access dynamics. As such, we expect to use
both list price reductions and up-front discounts to achieve these
lower net prices. To ensure these benefits reach patients, it will be
important for Congress to ensure that plans do not create new barriers
or restrictions that hinder patient access and undermine the spirit of
the rule.
Question. To what extent are the back-end rebates your company
currently offers contingent on the amount of market share realized for
your drugs as a result of Part D plan formulary placement and other
techniques?
Answer. Pfizer's contracts with Part D Health Plans and PBMs
negotiating on their behalf do not make rebates contingent on market
share.
Question. Please provide a breakdown of percentage of sales that go
to each payer (including Medicare, Medicaid, private pay, other) and a
similar percentage by volume of the total number of each drug compared
to total volume. Please provide this data for the most recent year
available.
Answer. Pfizer's prescription pharmaceutical products are sold
principally to wholesalers, and therefore the Company does not have
sufficient visibility into wholesaler distribution at the channel level
to provide responses as requested. We welcome the opportunity to
discuss with your committee staff the confidential information
requested and what we maintain in the ordinary course of business.
Question. Do your companies hire consultants or lobbyists to
promote products at State Medicaid Pharmacy and Therapeutics
Committees?
Answer. No.
Question. To whom do you disclose advocacy activities surrounding
State Medicaid programs, if at all?
Answer. Pfizer is committed to the principle of transparency--the
disclosure of activities reflecting participation in efforts of public
interest. These activities include such areas as funding for
educational activities, the status of Pfizer's U.S. pharmaceutical
post-marketing commitments, Pfizer's pipeline of experimental
medicines, the registration and reporting of results of clinical
trials, political contributions in the United States and payments to
U.S. health care professionals. The information we report includes
grants to support independent medical education, support for
fellowship, scholarship and visiting professorship programs, grants to
patient organizations, medical and scientific associations, and
academic or other medical centers, charitable contributions, health
care-related support to civic organizations and health care-related
non-promotional sponsorships to organizations. For descriptions of
types of support, please visit https://www.pfizer.com/purpose/
independent-grants/transparency-in-grants. Any Medicaid specific
advocacy funding we provide would be captured in these reports.
Question. Please describe how the costs of programs are accounted
for within your company's financial statements. Please also describe
the types of market information, such as prescribing and use patterns,
that your company collects from different types of patient assistance
programs and patient hub services.
Answer. Pfizer's patient assistance program is a charitable free
drug program that provides commercially available Pfizer medicines free
of charge to financially eligible uninsured and underinsured patients.
Separate from the Pfizer patient assistance program, Pfizer also offers
patient support programs, which are limited access reimbursement
support offerings to patients to assist with obtaining access to and
coverage of a prescribed Pfizer medicine.
The product and administrative costs for the patient assistance
program are charged against Pfizer's Selling, General and
Administrative Expenses line in the income statement.
Pfizer gathers data in the course of providing free drugs to
patients via the patient assistance program. We can bucket data
collection in several ways:
(1)
Transactional data--Utilized to determine patient
eligibility to receive free access to a physician-prescribed
therapy.
(2)
Operational data--The operational data is utilized to
provide free access to medicines to the eligible patient and
the following is reported at an aggregated level: (i) program
utilization trends; (ii) application processing trends; (iii)
patient coverage trends; (iv) channel utilization (distribution
versus pharmacy); (v) fulfillment and order processing days;
and (vi) call metrics.
Pfizer gathers the following two categories of data when providing
patient support programs:
(1)
Transactional--Utilized to assist in accessing prescribed
therapy and to determine insurance coverage for the patient.
This information contains data such as the outcome of a
benefits investigation, information to determine the financial
need and eligibility for patient support, and disposition of
the patient case (i.e., sent to a specialty pharmacy for
fulfillment, sent to Pfizer patient assistance program, triaged
to other financial options, or rejected/denied).
(2)
Operational--These fields could include primary and
secondary payers, out-of-pocket costs borne by the patient,
turnaround time to obtain insurance approval, prior
authorization requirements, number of cases requiring appeals,
and other data elements on access dynamics. In addition to
these elements, Pfizer will collect relevant adverse events as
required by Pfizer drug safety.
Question. Please provide a list of all contributions since January
1, 2014, that your company has made to any tax exempt organizations
working on issues related to drugs within your product lines, including
but not limited to patient groups, disease awareness groups, medical or
professional societies, universities or hospitals, industry
associations or leagues. For each contribution, please provide the name
of the organization that received the donation, the date the donation
was made, the amount of the donation, and a description of the purpose
of the contribution (i.e., was the contribution for the general fund, a
specific purpose to a specific program, or continuing medical
education). Please also note whether the contribution was unrestricted
or restricted; if it was restricted, please explain all restrictions.
Finally, if your company maintains a foundation or other separate
charitable arm, please provide the name of all such entities, and list
all donations made from that entity or entities.
Answer. Information about Pfizer's charitable giving is listed on
Pfizer.com. Please see the annual reports dating back to 2008 available
at https://www.pfizer.
com/purpose/independent-grants/transparency-in-grants, which include
the recipient name, the contribution amount and the annual quarter in
which it was made, and a description of the relevant program or
project. This data is updated each quarter. Data from Q4 2018 is
currently being analyzed and will be available at the end of March
2019. The annual reports include various funding types and recipient
types. However, in collating this data, Pfizer does not characterize
the organizations as working on issues related to drugs within product
lines, or contributions as restricted or unrestricted. Consequently,
the requested data is not available in that format.
Note that information regarding charitable contributions from the
Pfizer Foundation is not included in these reports, so Pfizer has
included a Pfizer Foundation Grant Summary as Exhibit 3. The Pfizer
Foundation has been working to expand health-care access to people
around the world for nearly 65 years. The impact of this work is
significant and far-reaching, helping underserved individuals from
diverse backgrounds in remote corners of the globe. Through the Pfizer
Foundation's global health strategy, we provide grant and investment
funding to support organizations and social entrepreneurs in an effort
to improve health care delivery in low-and middle-income countries and
increase access to health care for underserved communities.
Question. Pay for delay agreements cost consumers and taxpayers
billions in higher drug costs every year. The FTC has gone after drug
companies that enter into these settlements where the brand pays the
generic company to keep its lower cost alternative off the market. I'm
the lead Republican sponsor of S. 64, the ``Preserve Access to
Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act,'' which would help put an end
to these deals.
Do you agree that these pay-off agreements keep drug costs high for
patients because they delay competition?
Answer. Pfizer wants to work with you on this issue because we
agree that gaming the patent system is unacceptable. The company's
patent settlements do not involve ``pay for delay.'' On the contrary,
when Pfizer settles patent litigation with generic firms, it does so on
terms that generally enable entry of generic competition earlier than
the expiration of its patents and that do not involve unlawful reverse
payments. Pfizer's patent settlements thus involve lawful compromises
that accelerate patient access to lower cost generics relative to the
expiration of its patents.
Question. Has your company ever entered into these kinds of
settlements with a generic company?
Answer. No. On the contrary, when Pfizer settles patent litigation
with generic firms, it does so on terms that generally enable entry of
generic competition earlier than the expiration of its patents and that
do not involve unlawful reverse payments. Pfizer's patent settlements
thus involve lawful compromises that appropriately resolve patent
disputes and accelerate patient access to lower cost generics relative
to the expiration of its patents. While Pfizer has been the target of
plaintiff lawyer driven class action lawsuits challenging certain of
its settlements with generic companies, we believe these lawsuits are
without merit and are vigorously asserting the pro-competitive nature
of these settlements in court.
Question. Do you support the pay for delay bill?
Answer. Pfizer agrees that gaming the patent system is
unacceptable. We hope to work with you on legislation that prohibits
anticompetitive patent settlements that is prospective, clearly defines
violations and what is deemed to be an improper settlement and does not
presume all patent settlement agreements are per se illegal and
anticompetitive. Laws or actions to restrict certain kinds of
pharmaceutical patent settlements could prevent some pro-consumer
settlements that bring generics to market prior to patent expiration--
patent settlements often include an agreement that enables generics to
enter the market earlier than the date of patent expiration, speeding
patient access to more affordable generic options.
rebate traps/walls
Question. I'm increasingly concerned about the effect of so-called
``rebate traps'' or ``rebate walls'' on patients' access to quality,
lower cost medicine. I understand there is ongoing litigation
challenging these practices as anti-competitive.
Does your company engage in the bundling of rebates over multiple
products? If so, why? And what benefit does the consumer gain from
that?
Answer. Pfizer does currently bundle rebates over multiple
products. Pfizer does offer bundling arrangements to obtain formulary
positions that allow patients to access our medicines that otherwise
might be restricted.
Question. Does your company view these practices as anticompetitive
or harmful to patients' access to quality, lower cost medicine?
Answer. Pfizer does not believe bundling is inherently
anticompetitive and in certain circumstances can be procompetitive.
However, Pfizer does not tie bundled rebates to blocking lower cost
competitive agents and believes that when a firm with monopoly power
uses such practices to block lower cost alternatives the conduct is
anticompetitive.
Question. If a policy were adopted to eliminate rebates, or to
require that rebate savings be passed on to the consumer, would that in
and of itself solve the issue of rebate ``traps'' and ``walls''? And
would consumers benefit from such a policy?
Answer. A policy that moves rebates to discounts would not in and
of itself eliminate the ability of a market leader to block a lower
priced medicine. In both Medicare and commercial, the Health Plan is
still responsible for the majority of the drug cost and would therefore
receive the majority of the discount. The Health Plan or PBM would
still need to transition patients from the higher priced market leader
to the lower priced product in order to realize the savings from the
discount. Based on internal analysis, Pfizer expects that moving from a
rebate to a discount model will weaken a market leader's ability to
restrict other less expensive products, but it would not eliminate the
possibility.
drug pricing
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider regulatory costs or compliance? If so, how specifically do
those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at least
one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
Answer. The Food and Drug Administration is the primary regulatory
body for the pharmaceutical industry and is largely focused on the
safety, quality, and efficacy of medicines. The price of a new medicine
is most directly influenced by the value that the medicine may bring to
patients and society. Inherent in the value any product Pfizer brings
to the market are the quality, safety, delivery, efficacy, and
reliability of our medicines. These regulatory and compliance factors
are part of the underlying investments to identify a product's value
and are amongst the many factors we consider when we determine a launch
price or make a decision to change a price.
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider the risk of liability or litigation? If so, how specifically
do those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at
least one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
Answer. Liability and litigation are not primary considerations
when setting the list price of a medicine; the value that a product may
bring to patients and society is the most important factor considered.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Pat Roberts
Question. What role do you see value-based agreements (VBAs)
playing in the effort to reduce prescription drug costs? What potential
do these arrangements have to find the ``sweet spot'' between
controlling costs to patients and encouraging innovation of new drugs?
Answer. Value-based agreements (VBA) provide a framework for
manufacturers to be compensated based on a product's value to patients
and the overall health-care system. Although there are different
constructs for VBAs, the basic premise is that the net price for a
product will ultimately be derived based on an agreed upon performance
metric (e.g., clinical, financial, adherence, etc.). Therefore, VBAs
can play a role in reducing prescription drug costs by ensuring that
net prices are linked to value.
As we shift to a system that rewards value, manufacturers will be
incentivized to focus research and development (R&D) investments in
disease areas where there are unmet needs, to focus on best in class or
first in class medicines, and to design trials that provide the
necessary evidence to demonstrate the value of a medicine beyond the
regulatory standards of safety and efficacy to include the evidence to
support reimbursement. If manufacturers deliver medicines of value, the
system will reward the manufacturer which encourages innovation of new
drugs.
Question. How can VBAs help lower what patients pay out-of-pocket?
Answer. Value-based agreements (VBA) provide a framework for
manufacturers to be compensated based on a product's value to patients
and the overall health-care system. There are many different types of
VBAs including those based on clinical and/or financial performance
metrics for a product. Based on the outcomes achieved, payers use this
information to inform how they cover products. Products that perform
better should be covered in a more favorable manner which often
includes lower out-of-pockets costs for patients which is a benefit to
patients in the near term. In the long term, patients can also benefit
from other savings either directly, (e.g., reducing spending on other
medications, lowering medical costs from reduced hospitalizations,
doctor's visits, etc.), or indirectly through lower premiums based on
reductions in total cost of care.
Question. Can Congress do more to allow for and encourage the use
of VBAs?
Answer. VBAs are in the very early stages of development in the
United States. Many payers and manufacturers have tested different
concepts, but to date VBAs have not achieved scale. There are multiple
reasons why VBAs represent a small fraction of manufacturer/payer
contracts (e.g., access to data, difficult and costly to administer,
etc.). There are certain aspects of the current U.S. regulatory
landscape that are perceived by many as not only complicating VBA
implementation but in some cases limiting their rapid uptake.
Stakeholders have frequently identified two key regulatory hurdles as
limiting the expanded adoption of VBAs: (i) the Anti-Kickback Statute
and (ii) the Medicaid Best Price calculation requirement. While these
regulations serve important roles within the current volume-based
reimbursement system they do not contemplate innovative value-based
arrangements which have resulted in a lack of clarity on how to account
for these under the current regulatory framework. Ultimately, an
expansion of VBAs will require reforms to existing regulations that
enable more flexibility in designing VBAs.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Michael B. Enzi
Question. More than 10 years ago, I worked on a bipartisan basis
with my good friends Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch to develop a
biosimilars approval pathway. One of the difficult things was
accounting for the differences between biosimilars and generics. I have
said before that if a drug was a three-bedroom, two-bath home, a
biologic would be a skyscraper. The size and complexity of the items
are just that different. I understand that it is much harder to build a
skyscraper without blueprints than a house. Even though the science has
come a long way since then, there aren't as many biosimilars on the
market as we might have hoped. Do you think the incentives in the law
appropriately account for the differences between biosimilars and
generics?
Answer. The Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA)
created an abbreviated pathway for the licensure of biosimilars,
including interchangeable biologic products, and created the framework
biosimilar applicants and reference product sponsors use to resolve
patent disputes. There are currently seven biosimilars on the market in
the United States, and there are a number of biosimilars currently in
development. The FDA has approved a total of 18 biosimilars to date.
Nevertheless, the success of the BPCIA lies in the increased use of
these products, which will provide savings to both the patient and the
taxpayer.
To date, there have been two key policies that have helped support
the biosimilars marketplace: 340B pass-through status for biosimilars
and the separate billing/J code policy for biosimilars.
The separate billing/J code policy for biosimilars has aided in the
prompt reimbursement of biosimilars for physicians, which is critical
in supporting uptake of biosimilars. The separate billing/J code also
provides Congress and CMS with transparency on the average sales price
of the biosimilar versus the reference biologic. Below is a table
outlining the latest Medicare published average sales prices for the
reference biologic Remicade and both of the biosimilars on the market
for Remicade, Pfizer's Inflectra and Merck's Renflexis.\2\ It is
important to note that the average sales price (ASP) for both
biosimilars is lower than the ASP of the reference biologic. Yet, the
market share of the Inflectra biosimilar remains at 6 percent in open
systems (which excludes the VA and Kaiser, which are closed systems
where the insurer is the payer, the prescriber and the provider).

The 340B pass-through policy for biosimilars has been another
positive policy to support uptake of biosimilars in 340B hospitals. The
340B pass-through policy provides a temporary ``level playing field''
for the biosimilar and the reference biologic. Under the reimbursement
model of ASP + x%, providers are incentivized to use a higher cost
product to drive a higher ``+ x%'' reimbursement. As in the case of
biosimilars, when the biosimilar has a lower ASP the reimbursement is
lower to the health-care provider/340B hospital. The pass-through
policy provides temporary reimbursement parity for lower cost
biosimilars. This policy has encouraged 340B hospitals to adopt
biosimilars and gain experience and confidence in using them.
Despite these current policies, other adverse incentives that favor
higher-cost originator biologics are keeping biosimilars from reaching
patients. In many cases, payers decline to include lower-cost
biosimilars or generics in their formularies because they would risk
losing the rebates they could receive by covering higher-cost
medicines.
Question. I know there are proposals to essentially pay more for
biosimilars to make them more attractive, but that is not exactly what
we were intending when we wrote the law. Can you talk about adverse
incentives in the market and any barriers to market penetration that we
might address to help improve patient access to these lower cost
products?
Answer. Ninety percent of the medicines Americans take are generics
and competition from these drugs keeps prices low in most cases. The
biologics market, where some of the most expensive drugs exist, needs
similar competition. The market today has already seen demonstrated
savings as high as 40 percent relative to the branded product. In
Europe, biosimilars have obtained a market share of over 60 percent on
some products. However, in the United States, our biosimilar,
Inflectra, has captured only 6 percent, despite the fact that its
average selling price (ASP) is more than 25 percent lower than the
originator product. With more competition, Pfizer hopes even further
savings can be realized. We believe some of the adverse incentives and
barriers to market penetration include:
1.
The Rebate Trap: Brand-name biologic companies are using
maneuvers to block biosimilar competition such as higher
rebates and exclusionary contracts.
2.
Misinformation: We believe that some physician and patient-
directed materials created by brand companies mischaracterize
biosimilars, creating doubt and confusion about the safety and
efficacy of biosimilars. As defined by statute, an approved
biosimilar must be highly similar to and have no clinically
meaningful differences from the reference product and must have
the same mechanism of action (to the extent the mechanism(s) of
action of the reference product are known) as the reference
product. Thus, by definition, biosimilars are safe and
efficacious treatments relative to the reference product and
must work in the same way as the reference product. Any
information disseminated by reference product sponsors to
suggest or imply otherwise should be promptly addressed by the
FDA.
3.
Need for incentives: Legislative ideas to promote
biosimilar uptake could include a shared savings biosimilar
model; reduced patient cost sharing for biosimilars.
Although the biosimilar market in the United States is still
relatively new, Pfizer's experience has been that
anticompetitive conduct by brand-name biologic manufacturers,
combined with the lack of policy measures to support
appropriate uptake of biosimilars, have contributed to a slow
uptake. Therefore, we encourage you to consider measures to
help incentivize the use of biosimilars, which can
substantially lower Medicare costs with demonstrated savings to
date as high as nearly 40 percent relative to the branded
biologic.
In addition to stopping anticompetitive behavior (either
through government enforcement or in the courts through private
litigation), some key policy initiatives we believe will
support the uptake of biosimilars in the United States include:

Waiver of Part B Patient Coinsurance for Biosimilars for a
certain period of time. CMS should waive Part B patient
coinsurance amounts for biosimilars. Cost-sharing changes could
be applied at the Healthcare Common Procedure Coding System
(HCPCS) level. This would not change the overall payment for a
biosimilar; however, it would change the beneficiary's payment
percentage.

CMS should pursue a CMMI model designed to increase access
to biosimilars, including a ``shared savings'' model whereby
Medicare savings associated with prescribing a biosimilar, as
compared to a reference biological, would be shared with
providers.

CMS should maintain the current biosimilar pass-through
status as this provides biosimilars with a ``level playing
field'' with their higher priced reference biologic
competitors.

CMS should create payment incentives for plans by
contracting with a measure developer for a biosimilar use
measure for the STARS program, which would correct other
adverse incentives for biosimilar uptake for Medicare Advantage
plans.

Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
Question. We continue to hear that rebates negotiated off of the
list price of a drug are both good and bad.
Pharmacy benefit managers and plans have argued that rebates are
used to lower premiums across the board and that it is the best way to
seek a price concession on otherwise expensive drugs.
Your industry argues that these payers are insisting on higher
rebates that can only be achieved by raising list prices.
But patients often lose under this system, with out of pocket costs
being tied to list price. Insulin patients appear to be routinely
impacted by this perversity in the system.
Please explain to the committee how your company would reduce list
prices if rebates were no longer a part of the equation?
Answer. If finalized, the rule would result in lower out-of-pocket
patient costs at the pharmacy counter and help address the perverse
incentives in the system that have been contributing to higher list
prices for medicines.
In 2019, Pfizer expects to pay billions of dollars in rebates to
ensure patients with pharmacy benefits coverage in Medicare Part D and
patients in commercial plans have access to our medicines. If the
proposed rule to share rebates with consumers at the point of sale is
finalized, we estimate that seniors taking Pfizer medicines could save
$270 on average per year, and up to $574 per year for certain Pfizer
medicines, through lower cost sharing--and that would outweigh any
premium increases.
As currently written, the proposed rule only applies to the
Medicare and Medicaid managed care segments of the market. It will be
important to have rebate reform changes apply to both government
programs and the commercial market. A bifurcated market will make it
more challenging for manufacturers to reduce list price since the
commercial market covers more than 50 percent of Americans with
insurance and represents over half of the business for most
manufacturers.
If the proposed reform is modified to apply to all market segments,
we would evaluate the best options to arrive at a net price that
ensures patients have access to our medicines. Decisions would be made
on a product by product basis given that each therapeutic class has its
own set of competitive and access dynamics.
Question. What assurance can you provide that you would in fact
lower your prices?
Answer. If the rule is finalized consistent with the aforementioned
concerns, Pfizer is confident patients will benefit from savings of any
price concessions at the point of sale.
Question. What actions should be taken to ensure that patients are
actually seeing the benefits of lower out of pocket costs?
Answer. We strongly support ensuring that patients receive the
benefit of rebates at the pharmacy counter and look forward to working
with Congress and HHS on this issue. We encourage Congress to ensure
that plans do not impose new barriers or restrictions to access that
undermine the spirit of the rule and prevent patients from benefiting
from the savings.
Question. If rebates are driving high list prices for drugs as drug
manufacturers' claim, why do you think that Part B drugs, which have no
PBM rebates, are also seeing significant price increases? Whose fault
is that?
There are rebates involved with infusion medicines (Medicare Part B
drugs), and Pfizer is willing to engage with your staff in general
terms to explain the relationship and negotiations between
manufacturers and payers such as insurers and PBMs for drugs in this
space.
Pfizer also believes there are other ways to reform the Part B
payment system to move away from incentivizing the use of more costly
drugs. One solution we support for reforming Part B is a Competitive
Acquisition Program (CAP) to allow vendors to deliver and bill Medicare
for drugs, starting in a few cities. We believe this will inject
competition into the program.
Biosimilars are another solution. Pfizer is fully committed to the
goals set by Congress to bring new biosimilars to market, ensuring that
patients have access to a wide range of treatment options at a
competitive, affordable price. The market today has already seen
demonstrated savings as high as 40 percent relative to the branded
product. With more competition, we hope even further savings can be
realized.
rebate traps
Question. Pfizer's biosimilar to Janssen's Remicade has struggled
to gain market share, despite being priced at a significant discount to
the biologic.
Please explain the market challenges you are seeing with this
product. How does the practice of drug companies ``bundling'' the
prices of product portfolios and rebates associated with these drugs
limit competition and access to lower-cost biosimilars?
Answer. As more fully laid out in Exhibit 4, the primary barrier to
Inflectra's uptake is an anticompetitive contracting scheme that
targets both the payer (i.e., insurer) channel and the health-care
provider (i.e., hospitals, clinics and doctors) channel. The
centerpiece of the scheme is the ``rebate trap'' that uses pricing
penalties (i.e., the loss of significant rebates) to coerce insurers to
enter into exclusive deals that cover Remicade while effectively
blocking Inflectra from coverage. Multi-
product bundling is just one aspect of the conduct. Despite bringing a
lower-cost version of Remicade to market, this biosimilar has captured
less than 10 percent of the market.
Question. Do you attribute this to exclusionary contracts or
``paying for position'' to keep your product off formularies? Please
explain this practice and how it keeps lower-cost drugs out of the
hands of patients.
Answer. Pfizer attributes low uptake to an anticompetitive
contracting scheme as described above in response to Question 1.
This is particularly concerning not only because of the direct
impact regarding the health-care system's spend, but also because it
could become the playbook by which innovator biologics thwart entry by
biosimilars in the future. This could inhibit significant competition
to biologics going forward and act as a disincentive for companies to
invest in developing biosimilars.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Steve Daines
Question. As an advocate for improving Montanans' access to low-
cost medications, I've been a champion of the Creating and Restoring
Equal Access to Equivalent Samples (CREATES) Act, which would combat
anticompetitive practices used by some brand-name pharmaceutical
companies to block or delay competing generic drugs from entering the
market.
During the hearing when I asked if your company had ever withheld
samples from generic manufacturers, you answered emphatically no. Yet,
according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), generic drug
makers have made inquiries with the agency claiming they were unable to
access samples provided by Pfizer and AstraZeneca that are needed to
conduct studies to produce low-cost generic drugs.
Do you agree that denying generic drug manufacturers access to
samples keeps drug costs high for patients due to lack of competition?
Has your company refused to sell samples or placed any barriers in
the way of generic drug makers acquiring samples?
Are you aware of any outstanding requests for samples?
How does your company work to prevent abuses in the sample system?
Answer. As a patient-focused company and leading manufacturer of
innovative, generic, and biosimilar medicines, Pfizer supports
innovation and a strong, competitive marketplace. Consistent with these
values, Pfizer does not block generic manufacturers from purchasing our
products, and it has never been our policy to do so. Generic
manufacturers are treated the same as any other customer seeking to
purchase our products. Pfizer is not aware of any current, unfulfilled
requests from a generic manufacturer to purchase a Pfizer product.
Generic manufacturers seeking to purchase Pfizer products should
request the product from Pfizer's authorized distributors or, if the
product is not available at a distributor, from Pfizer directly, the
same as any other Pfizer customers. Pfizer's website includes a list of
our authorized distributors, from which customers (including generic
companies) may purchase most Pfizer products (see https://www.
pfizer.com/products/medicine-distributors). For products that are not
available via our authorized distributors and that are not in extreme
drug shortage or unavailable due to a recall, customers can contact
Pfizer's Customer Service center at 1-800-TRY-FIRST (1-800-879-3477) to
purchase product directly from Pfizer. The telephone number for
Pfizer's Customer Service center is also included on our website at
https://www.pfizer.com/contact. Pfizer makes its products available for
sale to appropriately licensed entities at Pfizer's listed price and on
Pfizer's standard terms of sale. We do not have any agreements with
authorized distributors that block the sale of Pfizer's products to
generic manufacturers.
Regarding the FDA List (the List), while Pfizer supports FDA's (the
agency) goal of providing transparency, Pfizer is concerned that the
List lacks certain key information and context and, as currently
presented, may create the misleading impression that all products on
the List are the result of bad faith attempts to block generic
manufacturer access to samples. The appearance of a product on the FDA
List means only that a generic manufacturer informed the agency at some
point in time that it was having difficulty purchasing the listed
product. FDA's own disclaimer states that the agency has not
independently investigated or confirmed whether a generic manufacturer
actually made a request to purchase product, and to whom.\3\ The FDA
List also lacks several important pieces of information that would
enable a New Drug Application (NDA) holder to investigate its
appearance on the List. The List does not include: (1) which generic
manufacturer made the request; (2) when and to whom the generic
manufacturer made the request (e.g., to a wholesaler, directly to the
NDA holder); (3) whether the generic manufacturer that made the inquiry
was thereafter able to obtain product; and (4) any reason(s) why a
generic manufacturer may not have been able to obtain product (e.g., a
recall). Finally, Pfizer notes that FDA does not currently inform an
NDA holder in real time when a generic manufacturer notifies the agency
that it is having difficulty obtaining product. Had the agency informed
Pfizer at the time it received the inquiries noted on the FDA List,
Pfizer could have then undertaken its own efforts to resolve the issue.
Pfizer communicated its concerns about the FDA List to the agency in
May 2018. For your information we have included Pfizer's letter to FDA
on this topic and the agency's response (see Exhibits 1 and 2 in the
Appendix).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/
HowDrugsareDevelopedandAp
proved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/
ucm607738.htm).
There are three new drug applications owned by Pfizer on the FDA
List: Embeda (NDA 022321), Tikosyn (NDA 020931) and Hemabate (NDA
017989). Embeda offers a good example of the List's shortcomings.
Pfizer acquired King Pharmaceuticals (the previous NDA holder of
Embeda) in March 2011, and two weeks later determined that Embeda
needed to be recalled from the U.S. market due to stability issues.
After diligently addressing the issues that led to the recall, Pfizer
relaunched Embeda to the U.S. market in January 2015, and it is
available for purchase via Pfizer's authorized distributors. However,
one consequence of the recall, was that Embeda was not available in the
U.S. market for almost 4 years which may explain why a generic
manufacturer had a problem obtaining it during those years. The FDA
List does not specify when the generic manufacturer's inquiry regarding
Embeda was made nor does the FDA List indicate that several generic
applications for Embeda had been submitted to FDA in 2010 (which means
that before the recall, several generic manufacturers were successfully
able to purchase Embeda, conduct the necessary testing, and file
Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs)). Pfizer has not identified
any recent inquiries from generic manufacturers seeking to purchase
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Embeda that have not been fulfilled.
The circumstances around Tikosyn also illustrate the List's
shortcomings. Pfizer was able to identify a single inquiry made by a
generic manufacturer directly to Pfizer to purchase Tikosyn in 2014. At
that time, Tikosyn was subject to an FDA imposed Risk Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategies (REMS) with Elements to Assure Safe Use
(``ETASU'') that restricted distribution, so Pfizer responded by asking
the manufacturer to obtain written confirmation from the FDA that
Pfizer's provision of the product to the generic manufacturer would not
be considered a violation of its REMS. The generic manufacturer did not
contact Pfizer further, and Pfizer never received any written
correspondence from the agency. FDA subsequently removed the REMS for
Tikosyn in 2016, and multiple generic versions of Tikosyn are now
approved, the first generic approval occurring in June 2016. This
context is not reflected in FDA's List.
Finally, with respect to Hemabate, this product was previously
subject to certain restrictions on distribution (i.e., it was sold only
to customers with medical and surgical intensive care centers) to
ensure its safe and appropriate use. This distribution approach was
established by the previous NDA holder (Pharmacia) and it continued
following Pfizer's acquisition of Pharmacia in 2003. Pfizer
discontinued this approach in early 2018 after determining that it was
no longer necessary, and this product is now available through our
authorized distributors. During the time when Hemabate was under
restricted distribution, it was not available at Pfizer's authorized
distributors, but had a generic manufacturer approached Pfizer's
Customer Service center directly, we would have been able to address
the inquiry. Pfizer's Customer Service was not able to identify any
specific requests from a generic manufacturer to purchase Hemabate that
have not been fulfilled.
We hope that this information explains the apparent discrepancy
between Mr. Bourla's testimony and the appearance of these Pfizer
products on the FDA List, and demonstrates Pfizer's diligence on these
issues and commitment to a competitive marketplace.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
re-evaluating business strategies in foreign countries
Question. Since taking office, President Trump has made reducing
drug prices one of his highest priorities--and has repeatedly spoken
about his frustration with the U.S. subsidizing the costs of
pharmaceuticals for the rest of the world. He has gone so far as to
issue proposals, like the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model, in
an attempt to bring down prescription drug prices.
With the increased scrutiny of the industry and of the drug supply
chain as a whole in the United States, have any of your companies re-
evaluated your business strategy in foreign countries?
Answer. Pfizer's purpose is breakthroughs that change patients'
lives; all aspects of Pfizer's business model are infused with this
purpose. It is Pfizer's priority to make our medicines and vaccines
available and accessible to all patients who need them, regardless of
where they live.
Proposals to implement international reference pricing for the U.S.
market would have far-reaching consequences to patient access,
innovation and our business strategies both in the United States and in
foreign countries.
If the United States were to implement the proposed International
Price Indexing (IPI) model, we believe that a change of this scale
could be very disruptive, challenging our ability to reach patients
both inside and outside of the United States in a timely manner while
fulfilling commitments to our shareholders and further investing in
R&D.
Question. If not, then why?
Answer. Pfizer agrees that more must be done to address foreign
pricing differentials. We want to continue to work with policymakers on
solutions to ensure other countries appropriately recognize the value
of innovation. Pfizer supports the concept of ``shared value for
innovation'' because it promotes global fairness. This means that all
nations recognize the importance and benefits of medicines to patients
and society and the significant investments required to develop them,
and that all patients should benefit, no matter where they live.
If foreign countries were to increase their support for shared
value for innovation, American patients would benefit based on
increased innovation, drug launches, competition and more access to new
medicines.
Question. If a proposal, like IPI, were implemented, would it force
your companies to potentially ``walk away from the negotiating table
when other countries demand low prices subsidized by America's
seniors,'' as HHS Senior Advisor for Drug Pricing Reform John O'Brien
has said?
Answer. While the IPI could lead to potential situations in which a
company would ``walk away'' as noted by John O'Brien, pricing is not
the only determinant of reimbursement negotiations in foreign
countries, many of which employ access controls, restricting patients'
ability to receive new innovative medicines.
We have concerns with the IPI model. The use of reference pricing
is strongly associated with market and patient access delays in
countries that have adopted reference pricing, among other cost-
containment mechanisms. Pfizer works with governments and health
systems around the world to support patients' access to the medicines
they need. We strongly believe that flexibility in our ability to set
global prices improves access to medicines.
Question. What are some of your ideas on how we can ensure
Americans aren't shouldering the full cost of pharmaceuticals?
Answer. Pfizer believes that developed countries have an important
role to play in supporting global innovation ecosystems. As such, we
would encourage the United States Government to continue to elevate the
innovation agenda in multilateral discussions, with an emphasis on
rewarding innovation in health-care delivery, science policy and
pharmaceutical breakthroughs (e.g., through the G7). U.S. trade
negotiations, such as those with Japan, also provide important
opportunities for the United States to secure robust commitments that
ensure countries protect intellectual property, provide fair market
access for U.S. companies, and appropriately recognize the value of
innovation.
Pfizer also believes that there are other ways to reform the Part B
payment system to move away from incentivizing the use of more costly
drugs. One solution we support for reforming Part B is a Competitive
Acquisition Program (CAP) to allow vendors to deliver and bill Medicare
for drugs, starting in a few cities. We believe this will inject
competition into the program.
Biosimilars are another solution. Pfizer is fully committed to the
goals set by Congress to bring new biosimilars to market, ensuring that
patients have access to a wide range of treatment options at a
competitive, affordable price. The market today has already seen
demonstrated savings as high as 40 percent relative to the branded
product. With more competition, Pfizer hopes even further savings can
be realized.
foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
Question. President Trump and Secretary Azar have both repeatedly
described their frustrations with ``foreign freeloading'' of U.S. drugs
in the last year.
``When foreign governments extort unreasonably low prices from U.S.
drug makers, Americans have to pay more to subsidize the enormous cost
of research and development. . . . It's unfair and it's ridiculous, and
it's not going to happen any longer.''
Do you agree that because of foreign countries' pricing and
reimbursement systems, U.S. patients and innovators are shouldering the
burden for financing medical advances?
Answer. Pfizer agrees that more must be done to address foreign
pricing differentials. Wealthy countries should reimburse innovative
medicines based on fair value. As stated above, ``foreign free-
loading'' has a significant impact on the U.S. biopharmaceutical
industry's investments in continued innovation. If the United States
secures agreements that ensure countries protect intellectual property,
provide fair market access for U.S. companies, and appropriately
recognize the value of innovation, this will help ensure U.S. patients
continue to have access to innovative medicines.
Question. How do foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
systems affect our prescription drug costs?
Answer. The U.S. health-care system offers patients more choice and
faster availability of innovative medicines. While government-run
health systems aim to provide care to their people, they are often
challenged to provide fast and easy access to the latest innovations.
These governments often have to make choices between paying for health
care and other government priorities.
The United States allows companies and providers to set prices that
reflect the benefits to patients and societies. This includes ensuring
that health-care professionals and patients have choices for
individualized care, that there is competition among companies, and
that their expectations for access to the latest medical advances are
met.
Some developed countries rely on price controls and other
government regulations to set the prices of health care, including
medicines. This may result in some lower prices but can also result in
restrictions on who is eligible to receive a covered medicine. A recent
op-ed in The Wall Street Journal pointed out that of the 45 new drugs
that FDA approved in 2015, all were covered by Medicare in the United
States in 2017, but only 19 in France, 13 in Canada and 11 in
Australia.\4\

\4\ https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-to-reduce-prescription-drug-
prices-first-do-no-harm-1155
0100537.
However, prices are not always higher in the United States. Nine
out of ten drugs that patients pick up at the pharmacy are generics,
and these drugs are less expensive than they are in Europe, Japan,
China or many countries around the world. The U.S. system is the most
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
efficient system for delivering lower-cost generics to patients.
Pfizer supports the concept of ``shared value for innovation''
because it promotes global fairness. This means that all nations
recognize the importance and benefits of medicines to patients and
society and the significant investments required to develop them, and
that all patients should benefit, no matter where they live.
If foreign countries were to increase their support for shared
value for innovation, American patients would benefit based on
increased innovation, drug launches, competition and more access to new
medicines.
Question. Are foreign governments taking note of the concerns being
raised by the Trump administration and have they responded in any way?
Answer. Pfizer believes that other governments are indeed taking
note of the administration's focus on health-care spending.
Question. Has there been any noticeable change in any of our trade
agreements since these concerns have been raised by the Trump
administration?
Answer. The Trump administration recently signed the U.S.-Mexico-
Canada Agreement (USMCA), which includes important commitments that
will help companies like Pfizer continue to innovate to bring new
therapies to patients. For example, the agreement includes a commitment
to provide 10 years of regulatory data protection for biologics. This
commitment had not been included in any trade agreement negotiated
prior to USMCA and is an important achievement. The Trump
administration is also pursuing new bilateral trade negotiations with
Japan, the EU, and the UK; because the negotiations have not yet
concluded, however, it is premature to comment on how those agreements
may compare to other U.S. trade deals.
medicaid closed formulary proposals
Question. In an attempt to bring down drug costs, various States
have been exploring whether to exclude certain drugs from its Medicaid
program. For example, the State of Massachusetts' recently asked CMS
for permission to create a closed formulary where the State Medicaid
program would pick at least one drug per therapeutic class. CMS denied
their waiver request citing violation of Federal law, but this proposal
does bring up important questions on how to contain drug prices in
State Medicaid programs.
If the principles of the Medicare Part D program--including the
necessary patient protections--were applied to State Medicaid programs,
do you think it lower drugs costs while ensuring access to patients?
Answer. Pfizer supports efforts to ensure patients have access to
medicines. Studies suggest that allowing more choice of medications has
positive results for patients: lowering the chances of drug
interactions and adverse events and increasing the efficacy of
treatment.\5\ Years of research have also shown that limiting
formularies correlates to poor medication adherence outcomes.\6\
Studies featuring Medicaid recipients with severe health conditions
indicate that in many instances, these restrictions can result in
negative health outcomes and other outcomes (such as increased
incarceration rates) without generating program savings or other
intended benefits (and sometimes increasing overall State costs).\7\

medicaid ``best price''
Question. In the Trump administration's Blueprint, they suggested
that because drug manufactures have to give Medicaid the ``best price''
on drugs, there is no incentive to offer deeper discounts to other
payers--both government and commercial--than what is already offered
under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Does the Medicaid ``best price'' requirement encourage
manufacturers to increase initial prices?
Answer. Medicaid Best Price is not a factor in setting our launch
prices.
Question. What, if any, changes would you suggest we make to the
program?
Answer. Pfizer encourages HHS to consider how to address the
challenges that Medicaid Best Price poses for value-based agreement
(VBAs). Specifically, we recommend that:

To allow for innovative approaches and risk sharing, a poor
outcome should not set a new price for Medicaid. This would
allow manufacturers to share more risk with commercial health
plans.

Approaches to reporting VBAs should be as simple as
possible. This would help avoid creating operational challenges
for companies that may prevent development of innovative
approaches.

Manufacturers should continue to have flexibility to make
reasonable assumptions in their price reporting, so that
reporting approaches can evolve to reflect changes in the
dynamic market and contracting environment.
outcomes-based contracts
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you highlight your
support of outcomes-based contracts and how we need to be shifting our
system toward that approach.
How will these contracts lower drug costs for patients in both the
near term and long-term?
Answer. Value-based agreements (VBA) provide a framework for paying
for medicines based on their value to patients and the overall health-
care system. There are many different types of VBAs including those
based on clinical and/or financial performance metrics for a product.
Based on the outcomes achieved, payers use this information to inform
how they cover products. Products that perform better should be covered
in a more favorable manner which often includes lower out-of-pockets
costs for patients which is a benefit to patients in the near term. In
the long term, patients can also benefit from other savings either
directly, (e.g., reducing spending on other medications, lowering
medical costs from reduced hospitalizations, doctor's visits, etc.), or
indirectly through lower premiums based on reductions in total cost of
care.
Question. How will they lower overall health-care costs for our
Federal programs?
Answer. VBAs can be implemented in Federal programs so that the
benefits described above can accrue to the Federal programs.
Question. What have the preliminary results looked like so far?
Answer. VBAs are in the very early stages of development in the
United States. Many payers and manufacturers have tested different
concepts but to date, VBAs have not achieved scale. There are multiple
reasons why VBAs represent a small fraction of manufacturer/payer
contracts (e.g., access to data, difficult and costly to administer,
etc.). There are certain aspects of the current U.S. regulatory
landscape that are perceived by many as not only complicating VBA
implementation but in some cases limiting their rapid uptake.
Stakeholders have frequently identified two key regulatory hurdles as
limiting the expanded adoption of VBAs: (i) the Anti-Kickback Statute
and (ii) the Medicaid Best Price calculation requirement. While these
regulations serve important roles within the current volume-based
reimbursement system they do not contemplate innovative value-based
arrangements which has resulted in a lack of clarity on how to account
for these under the current regulatory framework. Ultimately, an
expansion of VBAs will require reforms to existing regulations that
enable more flexibility in designing VBAs.
transparency/point of sale
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you express your
support for the Trump administration's proposal to allow manufacturers
to provide PBMs up-front discounts that are passed onto patients at the
point of sale.
Do you feel like this proposal will make the transactions within
the drug supply chain more transparent?
Answer. Pfizer acknowledges that providing discounts pursuant to
the safe harbor for point-of-sale price discounts will enhance
transparency of net pricing strategies and potentially drive downward
pressure on net prices. Nonetheless, Pfizer believes that the proposed
safe harbors are good for patients and lay the groundwork for the
systemic change needed to create a simpler, more cost effective, and
more transparent U.S. health-care system, and we are fully committed to
operating in this new system. We are concerned, however, that plans and
PBMs could impose new formulary restrictions and utilization barriers
to make up for lost rebates that undermine the spirit of the rule and
create new access challenges to patients. For patients to receive the
benefits of the rule, we urge policymakers to ensure that no new access
barriers are created as a way to compensate for lost rebate.
Question. If so, would this transparency bring down drug costs--
overall and for specialty drugs?
Answer. Only through such transparency can Pfizer and other
industry players ensure that discounts and other price reductions
directly benefit the patient, which is a critical factor driving
Pfizer's support for the Proposed Rule.
the relationship between wholesalers and manufacturers
Question. When talking about the pharmaceutical supply chain, a lot
of focus has been placed on the Pharmacy Benefit Manager. But there's
another side of the equation that I'd like to ask about: how do
wholesalers negotiate pricing with manufacturers?
Answer. Wholesalers pay list price for our products. They may
receive prompt pay discounts, which would reduce their net price.
Wholesalers also can earn bona fide service fees based on performing
services that are important to pharmaceutical manufacturers.
Question. What impact does this have on drug costs?
Answer. These discounts and fees are relatively consistent across
products and do not significantly impact drug costs.
Question. What incentives or disincentives do they have to contain
price increases?
Answer. As a result of the competitive nature of their business,
wholesalers do have an incentive to contain price increases.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
proposed rebate rule
Question. As has been done in many other settings, drug
manufacturers said during the hearing that one reason list prices for
drugs are high is that pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) demand
larger and larger rebates in order for the drug to receive favorable
placement on a formulary. You and your colleagues who testified during
the hearing stated if the administration's proposal on changes to the
anti-kickback safe harbor for pharmaceutical rebates took effect, your
company would likely lower list price.
Like many Oregonians, I am skeptical drug manufacturers would
voluntarily lower their prices. Therefore, would you support
legislation that would (1) make similar changes the administration has
put forward related to Part D and Medicaid managed care, (2) change the
rebate system in a similar way to the proposal for the commercial
market, and (3) require drug makers to lower the list price of their
drugs equal to the amount of rebates provided today?
Answer. Pfizer would support legislation that reforms the current
system of rebating to one in which payers are required to use
manufacturer provided discounts to ensure that the patient gets the
benefit of the discount at the point of sale. We support this reform
across all segments of the market where private sector negotiations
result in lower net prices including Medicare Part D, Medicaid managed
care and the commercial markets.
We realize that the transition away from rebates toward a point-of-
sale discount model will result in a lowering of our net prices.
Despite this potential negative financial impact, we support efforts to
eliminate rebates because we believe the new model will be good for
patients.
As currently written, the proposed rule only applies to the
Medicare and Medicaid managed care segments of the market. It will be
important to have any rebate reform apply to both government programs
and the commercial market as that will also lead to a lowering of list
prices as well. A bifurcated market will make it more challenging for
manufacturers to reduce list price since the commercial market covers
more than 50 percent of Americans with insurance and represents over
half of the business for most manufacturers.
If the proposed rule is modified to apply to all market segments,
we would evaluate the best options to arrive at a net price that
ensures patients have access to our medicines. Decisions would be made
on a product by product basis given that each therapeutic class has its
own set of competitive and access dynamics. To ensure these benefits
reach patients, it will be important for policymakers to ensure that
plans do not create new barriers or restrictions that hinder patient
access and undermine the spirit of the rule.
medicaid drug rebate program
Question. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) requires
manufacturers to provide a basic rebate and an additional inflationary
rebate for both brand and generic drugs. The inflationary rebate is an
increasingly substantial part of total rebates due in large part to
large increases in drug prices that exceed inflation. Under current
law, this inflationary rebate is capped at 100 percent of Average
Manufacturer Price (AMP). This is the case even when manufacturers
continue to raise their prices well above inflation.
Please provide a list of all of your pharmaceutical products that
have reached the Medicaid AMP rebate cap in any of the 20 quarters from
January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018.
For each drug listed in response to question 1, please also provide
a list of which quarters and years each drug hit the cap.
Answer. Given the highly confidential nature of the information
requested, we would need to discuss the scope of this request with your
staff.
medicaid drug rebate program compliance
Question. I am concerned about recent reports and legal settlements
surrounding drug manufacturers' failure to comply fully with the
requirements of the MDRP. For example, an analysis by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General
found that between 2012 and 2016 taxpayers may have overpaid by as much
as $1.3 billion for 10 potentially misclassified drugs. That is why I
introduced the Right Rebate Act with Chairman Grassley to prevent drug
manufacturers from manipulating Medicaid to increase their profits.
However, I continued to be concerned about oversight and manufacturer
compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Accordingly, please describe the following: your company's current
compliance plan and procedures used to ensure compliance with the
requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program including internal
audits or other checks you use to identify compliance vulnerabilities;
any past or ongoing issues of non-compliance; any corrective actions
taken to address identified problems or issues of non-compliance with
the MDRP and how such steps were communicated to the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services; and any steps taken to improve
compliance and ensure that all Medicaid drug rebates owed to the
Federal Government and the States are paid in full.
Answer. It is Pfizer's policy to comply with all legislation,
regulations, provisions, requirements, terms and conditions of the
MDRP.
In order for its outpatient drugs to be covered by the Medicaid
program, a manufacturer must enter into a national rebate agreement
with the Secretary of HHS. This agreement generally requires
manufacturers to offer Medicaid agencies the mandated discounts for
covered prescription drugs. Pfizer is responsible for calculating and
reporting to the Federal Government on a monthly and quarterly basis
various metrics for each of Pfizer's products and, ultimately, for
paying corresponding rebates based on Medicaid recipients' purchases of
the company's covered drugs. In return for these rebates, State
Medicaid agencies must pay for all of the drug company's covered drugs
(with certain limited exceptions). If the price of the manufacturer's
drug rises faster than the inflation rate, States may require an
additional rebate. Pfizer and/or its predecessor entities have signed a
Rebate Agreement with HHS for all Pfizer labeler codes and Pfizer
remains vigilant of its obligations under the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program.
The Company has robust policies and procedures to ensure compliance
with government price calculations, certification and reporting under
MDRP including Pfizer's certification, reporting, payment obligations,
records retention and audit obligations. The Company's policies and
procedures are also meant to impart to Pfizer employees an
understanding of the government pricing metrics calculated under the
MDRP. Consistent with Pfizer's policies and procedures and available
CMS guidance, if Pfizer becomes aware of any instances of non-
compliance with the MDRP, Pfizer reports and/or communicates with CMS.
Based on our current information and belief, Pfizer complies with CMS
regulations and interacts with CMS to take corrective action as
instructed.
bonus payments tied to specific drugs
Question. I am concerned by the potential for employee financial
incentives to encourage high launch prices and price increases for
prescription drugs.
Is your salary, bonus, or other compensation tied to sales or
revenue targets of a single product your company sells? Has it ever
been? If yes, please state the product or products to which your
salary, bonus or other compensation was tied.
Answer. No. Dr. Bourla's salary, bonus, or other compensation is
not nor has ever been tied to the sales or revenue targets of a single
product.
Question. Is your salary, bonus, or other compensation tied to
either revenue or net income of the company as a whole? Has it ever
been? If yes, please explain what assumptions about price increases are
used when the compensation committee sets revenue or net income goals.
Does the compensation committee provide any guidance to executives in
regards to the amount of revenue that the company will generate from
price increases versus volume growth?
Answer. Dr. Bourla, along with over approximately 48,000 other
colleagues, participates in Pfizer's annual bonus plan, Pfizer's Global
Performance Plan (GPP), which is funded annually based on Pfizer's
performance measured against three financial metrics: revenue, adjusted
earnings per share and cash flow from operations and has been since
2008.
Therefore, any annual bonuses through Pfizer's GPP, determined by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors and ratified by
the independent members of the Board, is in part based on company
revenue and net income as adjusted earnings per share is derived from
net income. In determining Dr. Bourla's bonus, the Compensation
Committee also takes into account other factors such as his individual
performance against his annual performance objectives and overall
company performance (e.g., pipeline). Neither Dr. Bourla's salary nor
other compensation is tied to revenue or net income of the company as a
whole.
In setting the corporate financial goals for compensation purposes,
the Compensation Committee uses the company's annual budget as the
starting point and it is adjusted accordingly based on the final
business plan discussion which accounts for various factors, including
access, rebates, losses of exclusivity and expected price adjustments.
The Compensation Committee does not provide any guidance with
regard to the amount of revenue that the company will generate from
price increases versus volume growth.
net prices
Question. In your testimony, you stated, ``In 2018, the average net
price of Pfizer's medicines in the United States declined 1 percent.''
Please describe how the company's year-over-year aggregate net price is
calculated.
Answer. The Net Sales Price impact versus the Prior Year reflects
the year-over-year change in average net selling price (calculated as
net sales / units) multiplied by the current year's units. This
calculation is performed at a product NDC level, and then aggregated up
to the product and then the total business level.
The company's aggregate year-over-year impact of price on growth is
the summation of the sales price impact versus prior year from all
products in dollars, divided by the prior year's total net revenues. In
2018, the year-over-year impact on price on growth for the U.S.
pharmaceutical business was negative 1 percent.
Question. How many products are included in the calculation of the
average net price change? What was the median net price change?
Answer. For 2018, there are a total of 399 products included in the
U.S. portfolio; median net price impact on growth is negative 4
percent.
Question. Is net price weighted? If so, how? For example, in
determining the aggregate net price does the company assign different
weights to different products based on volume or other factors? Are
``on patent'' and ``off patent'' drugs weighted identically? Are other
statistical weights used or are all products treated equally?
Answer. Aggregate change in net price is weighted based on product
volume (units) and mix. All products--both ``on patent'' and ``off
patent''--are treated identically.
Question. Does the figure that you provided during your testimony
account for U.S. prices, international prices, or both? Generally
speaking, when your company reports net price changes, does it
differentiate between U.S. and international prices?
Answer. The figure of negative 1 percent price impact on growth
provided during the testimony is for the United States. Generally
speaking, when we respond to inquiries on the impact of price on
growth, we have responded on a global basis, a U.S. only basis, or
both, dictated by how the inquiry is posed.
Question. Please list the five drugs your company sold in the U.S.
that had the greatest year-over-year net price increase in 2018, noting
the increase for each drug by dollar figure and percentage.
Answer. The following products had the greatest positive impact of
sales price on growth in the United States in 2018: Prevnar, Lyrica,
Chantix, Pristiq, Relpax.
Question. Please list the five drugs your company sold in the U.S.
that had the lowest year-over-year net price increase (and/or the
greatest decrease) in 2018, noting the increase (or decrease) for each
drug by dollar figure and percentage.
Answer. The following products had the greatest negative impact of
sales price on growth in the United States in 2018: Xeljanz, Viagra,
Inflectra, Ibrance, Celebrex.
Question. For 2018, what was the average net price change in the
U.S. market for (1) drugs with no competition, (2) drugs with only
branded competition, and (3) drugs with generic competition?
Answer. The 2018 impact of price on growth from branded products in
the United States was 2 percent. 2018 impact of price on growth from
remainder of portfolio (excluding Branded Products) in the United
States was negative 5 percent.
Question.Pfizer has lost exclusivity for several products in recent
years, including Viagra, Zyvox, Relpax, Tygacil, and Pristiq. For each
of these products, please provide the percentage and dollar change in
the average net price from (1) the last full year in which Pfizer
maintained product exclusivity to the (2) first full year in which
generic competition was present in the market.
Answer. Pfizer has lost exclusivity on several products in recent
years, including: 2014: Detrol, Rapamune, Celebrex; 2015: Zyvox; 2016:
Relpax, Tygacil; and 2017: Viagra, Pristiq.
In all but one case, the net price impact of the branded products
listed above was negative the year after exclusivity was lost,
reflecting market dynamics and the competitive environment.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez
Question. During the hearing, when I asked whether your company
engaged in tactics to delay generic production of your products, you
answered ``no''. However, Pfizer appears on the FDA's list of companies
who have access complaints against them. Can you explain the
discrepancy between your answer and the FDA list? The FDA list can be
found here: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApproval
Process/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/
Abbreviated
NewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/ucm607738.htm.
Answer. As a patient-focused company and leading manufacturer of
innovative, generic, and biosimilar medicines, Pfizer supports
innovation and a strong, competitive marketplace. Consistent with these
values, Pfizer does not block generic manufacturers from purchasing our
products, and it has never been our policy to do so. Generic
manufacturers are treated the same as any other customer seeking to
purchase our products. Pfizer is not aware of any current, unfulfilled
requests from a generic manufacturer to purchase a Pfizer product.
Generic manufacturers seeking to purchase Pfizer products should
request the product from Pfizer's authorized distributors or, if the
product is not available at a distributor, from Pfizer directly, the
same as any other Pfizer customers. Pfizer's website includes a list of
our authorized distributors, from which customers (including generic
companies) may purchase most Pfizer products (see https://www.
pfizer.com/products/medicine-distributors). For products that are not
available via our authorized distributors and that are not in extreme
drug shortage or unavailable due to a recall, customers can contact
Pfizer's Customer Service center at 1-800-TRY-FIRST (1-800-879-3477) to
purchase product directly from Pfizer. The telephone number for
Pfizer's Customer Service center is also included on our website at
https://www.pfizer.com/contact. Pfizer makes its products available for
sale to appropriately licensed entities at Pfizer's listed price and on
Pfizer's standard terms of sale. We do not have any agreements with
authorized distributors that block the sale of Pfizer's products to
generic manufacturers.
Regarding the FDA List (the List), while Pfizer supports FDA's (the
agency) goal of providing transparency, Pfizer is concerned that the
List lacks certain key information and context and, as currently
presented, may create the misleading impression that all products on
the List are the result of bad faith attempts to block generic
manufacturer access to samples. The appearance of a product on the FDA
List means only that a generic manufacturer informed the agency at some
point in time that it was having difficulty purchasing the listed
product. FDA's own disclaimer states that the agency has not
independently investigated or confirmed whether a generic manufacturer
actually made a request to purchase product, and to whom.\8\ The FDA
List also lacks several important pieces of information that would
enable a New Drug Application (NDA) holder to investigate its
appearance on the List. The List does not include: (1) which generic
manufacturer made the request; (2) when and to whom the generic
manufacturer made the request (e.g., to a wholesaler, directly to the
NDA holder); (3) whether the generic manufacturer that made the inquiry
was thereafter able to obtain product; and (4) any reason(s) why a
generic manufacturer may not have been able to obtain product (e.g., a
recall). Finally, Pfizer notes that FDA does not currently inform an
NDA holder in real time when a generic manufacturer notifies the agency
that it is having difficulty obtaining product. Had the agency informed
Pfizer at the time it received the inquiries noted on the FDA List,
Pfizer could have then undertaken its own efforts to resolve the issue.
Pfizer communicated its concerns about the FDA List to the agency in
May 2018. For your information we have included Pfizer's letter to FDA
on this topic and the agency's response (see Exhibits 1 and 2 in the
Appendix).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ (https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/
HowDrugsareDevelopedandAp
proved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/
ucm607738.htm).
There are three new drug applications owned by Pfizer on the FDA
List: Embeda (NDA 022321), Tikosyn (NDA 020931) and Hemabate (NDA
017989). Embeda offers a good example of the List's shortcomings.
Pfizer acquired King Pharmaceuticals (the previous NDA holder of
Embeda) in March 2011, and two weeks later determined that Embeda
needed to be recalled from the U.S. market due to stability issues.
After diligently addressing the issues that led to the recall, Pfizer
relaunched Embeda to the U.S. market in January 2015, and it is
available for purchase via Pfizer's authorized distributors. However,
as a consequence of the recall, Embeda was not available in the U.S.
market for almost 4 years which may explain why a generic manufacturer
had a problem obtaining it during those years. The FDA List does not
specify when the generic manufacturer's inquiry regarding Embeda was
made nor does the FDA List indicate that several generic applications
for Embeda had been submitted to FDA in 2010 (which means that before
the recall, several generic manufacturers were successfully able to
purchase Embeda, conduct the necessary testing, and file Abbreviated
New Drug Applications (ANDAs)). Pfizer has not identified any recent
inquiries from generic manufacturers seeking to purchase Embeda that
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
have not been fulfilled.
The circumstances around Tikosyn also illustrate the List's
shortcomings. Pfizer was able to identify a single inquiry made by a
generic manufacturer directly to Pfizer to purchase Tikosyn in 2014. At
that time, Tikosyn was subject to an FDA imposed Risk Evaluation and
Mitigation Strategies (REMS) with Elements to Assure Safe Use
(``ETASU'') that restricted distribution, so Pfizer responded by asking
the manufacturer to obtain written confirmation from the FDA that
Pfizer's provision of the product to the generic manufacturer would not
be considered a violation of its REMS. The generic manufacturer did not
contact Pfizer further, and Pfizer never received any written
correspondence from the agency. FDA subsequently removed the REMS for
Tikosyn in 2016, and multiple generic versions of Tikosyn are now
approved, the first generic approval occurring in June 2016. This
context is not reflected in FDA's List.
Finally, with respect to Hemabate, this product was previously
subject to certain restrictions on distribution (i.e., it was sold only
to customers with medical and surgical intensive care centers) to
ensure its safe and appropriate use. This distribution approach was
established by the previous NDA holder (Pharmacia) and it continued
following Pfizer's acquisition of Pharmacia in 2003. Pfizer
discontinued this approach in early 2018 after determining that it was
no longer necessary, and this product is now available through our
authorized distributors. During the time when Hemabate was under
restricted distribution, it was not available at Pfizer's authorized
distributors, but had a generic manufacturer approached Pfizer's
Customer Service center directly, we would have been able to address
the inquiry. Pfizer's Customer Service was not able to identify any
specific requests from a generic manufacturer to purchase Hemabate that
have not been fulfilled.
We hope that this information explains the apparent discrepancy
between Mr. Bourla's testimony and the appearance of these Pfizer
products on the FDA List, and demonstrates Pfizer's diligence on these
issues and commitment to a competitive marketplace.
Question. When new products enter the market, do drug companies set
high initial rebates and then provide deep rebates in order to gain
access to insurance plan's formularies?
Answer. Launch pricing is driven by a multitude of factors, the
most important being the medicine's impact on patients and their
health. We also may consider other factors like the medicine's
potential to reduce other health-care costs, such as hospital stays;
the availability of other treatments and generic options; affordability
for patients, insurers and governments; and investments to maintain the
quality, safety, delivery, and reliability of our medicines.
Given the consolidation that has taken place in the U.S. market,
the vast majority of retail prescriptions are managed by a few large
PBMs. Pharmaceutical manufacturers must successfully negotiate with
these PBMs to gain access to their formularies or risk having their
products disadvantaged or even excluded from coverage.
The system has evolved in a manner where rebates play a significant
role in how the PBM business is transacted and in the decisions
regarding product placement on formularies. PBMs often win or lose
business on the basis of rebate guarantees and are therefore
incentivized to favor products with high list prices and deep rebates
assuming comparable safety and efficacy. Because the PBMs have enormous
leverage and depend on rebates to attract and retain clients, many
manufacturers will enter the market with higher list prices and deeper
rebates in order to ensure patients have access to their medicines.
Question. If CMS finalizes the rebate rule, do you anticipate
future products entering the market with significantly lower initial
list prices?
Answer. Launch pricing will be driven by product value and
competitive intensity of the specific therapeutic category.
Importantly, if finalized, the rule could result in lower out-of-pocket
patient costs at the pharmacy counter and help address the perverse
incentives in the system that have been contributing to higher list
prices for medicines.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Thomas R. Carper
Question. What are your recommendations for lowering prices for the
40 percent of drugs that do not offer rebates in Medicare Part D? In
the health insurance plans that you offer your employees, do you ask
your insurers to pass through the full manufacturer rebates to the
beneficiaries?
Answer. It is unclear if the 40 percent of drugs that do not offer
rebates in Medicare Part D are brand medicines or generics. However,
Pfizer pledges to bring more affordable treatment options to the
market. Our mid-to late-stage pipeline contains five biosimilar
candidates expected to launch in the next 2 to 3 years. Ninety percent
of medicines Americans take are generics, and competition from these
drugs keeps prices low in most cases. We need to bring similar
competition to the biologics market, where some of the most expensive
drugs exist. The market today has already seen demonstrated savings as
high as 40 percent relative to the branded product. With more
competition, we hope even further savings can be realized.
Pfizer's plan design is generous and corresponding employee cost
sharing for prescription drugs is already very limited--in fact, for
many products, Pfizer employees experience no cost sharing at all.
Given this, the terms of contract with our PBM for our employee
benefits does not include a requirement to pass on rebates to Pfizer
employees at the point of sale.
Question. The systems for pricing and distributing drugs are opaque
and difficult to understand. What are your recommendations for
increasing transparency in how your companies set the list prices for
drugs, and for improving transparency in the supply chain for
prescription drugs? Would you support Federal standards for
transparency in setting the list prices for drugs?
Answer. Pfizer supports system-wide price transparency that is
thoughtful, purpose-driven, and that can result in improved patient
care, an enhanced understanding of the comparative value of all medical
services, and a more patient-centered use of health-care resources.
We would be interested in exploring with the committee ways to
ensure transparency across the health care system, including hospitals,
plans, PBMs, etc., so that we can make informed judgments about the
root of cost inflators in the system. We are also committed to ensuring
that patients, health-care professionals and payers understand our
commitment to pricing our medicines responsibly.
Regarding a Federal transparency standard, we believe that an
appropriately crafted, balanced piece of Federal legislation that
applies to all stakeholders in the health care system and preempts
future State laws could be beneficial for patients. However, Pfizer
believes that mandating disclosure of research and development,
manufacturing, or marketing costs to assess the value of medicines is
inconsistent with purpose-driven transparency.
Question. In nearly every sector of the health-care industry,
Medicare, Medicaid, employers, and insurers are moving away from fee-
for-service payments to reimbursements based on value and performance.
Prescription drugs and medical devices were the glaring exceptions to
this trend until recently. How many of your drugs are included in
value-based contracts and how many patients are benefiting from them?
Answer. Patient outcomes should determine our reimbursement and
Pfizer pledges that we will aggressively pursue value-based
arrangements. We should not be rewarded for treatments that do not
work.
Currently, Pfizer has value-based contracts for twelve drugs in our
portfolio.
The agreements are in place with commercial and Medicare payers
with millions of covered lives. In addition, Pfizer has a multi-product
innovative agreement that has been offered to the majority of States
for the Medicaid program, but currently only a small number of States
compromising less than five million lives have taken or are actively
considering the offer.
Question. How do these value-based contracts work to lower drug
prices for both patients and taxpayers?
Answer. Value-based agreements (VBA) provide a framework for
manufacturers to be compensated based on a product's value to patients
and the overall health-care system. There are many different types of
VBAs but the optimal structure of a VBA includes clinical and/or
financial performance metrics for a product. Based on the outcomes
achieved, payers use this information to inform how they cover
products. Products that perform better should be covered in a more
favorable manner which often includes lower out-of-pockets costs for
patients which is a benefit to patients in the near term. In the long
term, patients can also benefit from other savings either directly,
(e.g., reducing spending on other medications, lowering medical costs
from reduced hospitalizations, doctor's visits, etc.), or indirectly
through lower premiums based on reductions in total cost of care.
VBAs can be implemented in Federal and State programs so that the
benefits described above can accrue to the Federal programs thereby
benefitting taxpayers.
Question. Last year, Senator Portman and I did an investigation on
the pricing of an opioid overdose reversal drug called EVZIO,
manufactured by Kaleo. Kaleo increased the price of EVZIO from $575 in
2014 to $4,100 in 2017. We found that the best price Medicare was able
to get for EVZIO, about $4,000, was much higher than the price other
Federal programs and private insurers were able to get. It seemed that
Kaleo was able to get this higher price of $4,000 from Medicare by
helping doctors fill out paperwork showing that the drug was medically
necessary, even though there are cheaper alternatives on the market. As
a result of the investigation, Kaleo announced it will bring a generic
version of the drug to market at only $168 per pack. Are any of your
companies providing medical necessity paperwork to doctors in order to
get your drugs covered by Medicare?
Answer. Consistent with industry practice, Pfizer provides a sample
statement of medical necessity and appeals letters through our patient
support programs for patients, their caregivers and prescribing
physicians to help guide these individuals in gaining access to certain
Pfizer medicines after a physician has determined that a Pfizer product
is right for a patient and a prescription has been written. These
sample letters are generally PDF documents that describe the type of
information payers require to approve access/coverage of a particular
medication based upon the payers' formulary requirements, such as step
therapy (therapeutic agents that must be tried first), proof of
diagnosis or other common utilization management techniques that payers
determine. Pfizer does not customize these letters, and patients,
caregivers and physicians are advised that they are responsible for the
accuracy of the information that they submit to the payer to obtain
coverage and/or reimbursement. Sample letters are available from
Pfizer's third-party call centers which specialize in product access
triage with payers, field based reimbursement specialists and Pfizer
product websites. Pfizer sales representatives do not provide this
information to physicians.
Question. In 2017, the Rand Corporation estimated that biosimilar
drugs, which are competitors to complex, biologic drugs, could save the
United States more than $50 billion over the next decade. Some of you
have also argued that increasing the use of biosimilar drugs would help
lower drugs costs for consumers and taxpayers. What is delaying the
uptake of biosimilar drugs in the United States? What policies do you
recommend to increase the development of biosimilar drugs?
Answer. Pfizer believes that some of the adverse incentives and
barriers to market penetration include:
1.
The Rebate Trap: Brand-name biologic companies are using
maneuvers to block biosimilar competition such as higher
rebates and exclusionary contracts.
2.
Misinformation: Some physician and patient-directed
materials created by brand companies mischaracterize
biosimilars, creating doubt and confusion about the safety and
efficacy of biosimilars. As defined by statute, an approved
biosimilar must be highly similar to and have no clinically
meaningful differences from the reference product and must have
the same mechanism of action (to the extent the mechanism(s) of
action of the reference product are known) as the reference
product; thus, by definition, biosimilars are safe and
efficacious treatments relative to the reference product and
must work in the same way as the reference product. Any
information disseminated by reference product sponsors to
suggest or imply otherwise should be promptly addressed by FDA.
3.
Need for incentives: Legislative ideas to promote
biosimilar uptake could include a shared savings biosimilar
model; reduced patient cost sharing for biosimilars. More
detail is provided below.
Although the biosimilars market in the United States is still
relatively new, our experience has been that anticompetitive conduct by
brand-name biologic manufacturers, combined with the lack of policy
measures to support appropriate uptake of biosimilars, have contributed
to a slow uptake. Therefore, we encourage you to consider measures to
help incentivize the use of biosimilars, which can substantially lower
Medicare costs with demonstrated savings to date as high as nearly 40
percent relative to the branded biologic.
Some key policy initiatives we believe will support the uptake of
biosimilars in the United States are the following:

Waiver of Part B Patient Coinsurance for Biosimilars for a
certain period of time:
CMS should waive Part B patient coinsurance
amounts for biosimilars. Cost-sharing changes could be applied
at the HCPCS level. This would not change the overall payment
for a biosimilar; however, it would change the beneficiary's
payment percentage.

CMS should pursue a CMMI model designed to increase access
to biosimilars, including a ``shared savings'' model whereby
Medicare savings associated with prescribing a biosimilar, as
compared to a reference biological, would be shared with
providers.

CMS should maintain the current biosimilar pass-through
status as this provides biosimilars with a ``level playing
field'' with their higher priced reference biologic
competitors.

CMS should create payment incentives for plans by
contracting with a measure developer for a biosimilar use
measure for the STARS program, which would correct other
adverse incentives for biosimilar uptake for Medicare Advantage
plans.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
Question. The United States is one of the only countries in the
world to allow prescription drug manufacturers to advertise directly to
consumers through magazines, billboards, radio, and television
commercials. While I will not argue that it is beneficial to educate
consumers about an unfamiliar disease and encourage them to seek
medical help, most commercials from all of your companies recommend
asking about a specific brand name drug, not a medical condition.
Furthermore, even if your advertisements follow all FDA rules and list
medication side effects, they also almost always list these while a
smiling, apparently healthy person is walking on a beach.
Researchers say that this type of imagery, combined with viewing
hours of drug commercials each month, leads consumers to underestimate
the risks associated with medications. For the past decade, studies
have shown that aggressive direct-to-consumer advertising is associated
with rising drug prices and an increase in inappropriate drug
prescriptions.
Since researchers have concluded that consumers are
misunderstanding the benefits and risks described in your ads, what
further policies could help you and your colleagues ensure that you are
educating patients in a clear manner?
Answer. Pfizer wants patients to have access to our drugs and part
of this is making sure patients have the information they need. Pfizer
believes that direct-to-
consumer (DTC) advertising should be, first and foremost, a tool
through which we can provide patients with useful information to inform
them about their medical conditions, and the potential benefits and
risks of available treatment options so they can have a discussion with
their doctors and take an active role in managing their health.
The Office of Prescription Drug Promotion at the FDA, which has
responsibility for reviewing prescription drug advertising and
promotional labeling to ensure that the information contained in them
is not false or misleading, studies advertising so that regulations are
grounded in evidence on how best to ensure ads are accurate, balanced
and not misleading. The FDA's website describes in detail the many ways
that its Office of Prescription Drug Promotion ensures that DTC
advertising is not misleading.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ https://www.fda.gov/aboutfda/centersoffices/
officeofmedicalproductsandtobacco/cder/ucm
090142.htm.
DTC advertising is of significant educational importance to
patients, especially as the provision of health care becomes more
patient-centric. Over the last 2 decades, consumer research sponsored
by the industry and the FDA has underscored that clear, relevant
communication allows DTC advertising, when executed thoughtfully, to
have a positive impact on public health. For example, in 2004, a study
by FDA found that ``DTC ads help patients have better discussions with
their physicians and provide greater awareness of treatments. The study
demonstrated that when a patient asked about a specific drug, 88
percent of the time they had the condition that the drug treated. And
80 percent of physicians believed their patients understood what
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
condition the advertised drug treats.''
More recently, according to a 2017 survey, conducted by Princeton
Survey Research Associates International on behalf of PhRMA, Americans
overwhelmingly reported that DTC advertisements help inform people
about new treatments (88 percent), alert people to symptoms that are
related to a medical condition they may already have (81 percent), and
allow people to be more involved in their health care (79 percent).\10\
Similarly, a research survey published in 2017 with 4,481 U.S. adults
and sponsored by a working group of pharmaceutical companies has shown
DTC advertising conveys useful information.\11\ DTC ads raise awareness
about medications and effectively communicate potential risks and
benefits, but they also increase concern about potential side effects.

Pfizer believes that PhRMA, individual companies, academics and FDA
should continue to study DTC advertising to ensure that pharmaceutical
consumer communications are achieving their intended goals to educate,
inform information-seeking consumers and facilitate better discussions
with health-care professionals.
pharmaceutical companies continue to raise prices
Question. As you are well aware, high prescription drug prices are
the number one concern for Americans and their families. According to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average
American spends around $1,208 annually on prescription drugs. There
have been several instances where brand name or even generic drugs that
have been on the market for years continue to increase in price.
One of the most well-known examples is Mylan's increase of the
price of EpiPen from less than $100 in 2007 to more than $600 in 2016.
Another example, is the ever-increasing price of insulin. Sanofi
increased the price of a vial of Lantus from $88.20 in 2007 to $307.20
in 2017. And those are just a small sample of price increases.
Why don't we see price decreases for drugs that have been on the
market for years without new formulations or added benefit?
Answer. There are a number of reasons that the price of medicines
can change over time. While these reasons often include more obvious
changes such as discovery of new indications and new formulations, they
can also include less obvious changes such as improvements in the
manufacturing and supply chain and market-based factors.
Pfizer has reduced the price of many of our older off-patent
medicines in the United States, and we are committed to bringing more
affordable treatment options to the market to induce competition,
including generic and biosimilar medicines. Competition is the best way
to promote affordable access to quality, safe and effective medicines;
competition means more and better medicines, more options for patients,
and more affordable drugs.
pay for delay
Question. Pay for delay is a tactic that more and more branded drug
manufacturers have been using to stifle competition from lower-cost
generic manufacturers. This allows you to sidestep competition by
offering patent settlements that pay generic companies not to bring
lower-cost alternatives to market.
These ``pay-for-delay'' patent settlements benefit both brand-name
pharmaceutical companies by helping them avoid costly patent litigation
and general manufacturers by rewarding them a hefty sum to delay
entering the market with a cheaper drug alternative. However, these
deals do not benefit consumers. According to an FTC study, these
anticompetitive deals cost consumers and taxpayers $3.5 billion in
higher drug costs every year.
Does your company partake in pay-for-delay settlements?
Answer. No. On the contrary, when Pfizer settles patent litigation
with generic firms, we do so on terms that generally enable entry of
generic competition earlier than the expiration of its patents and that
do not involve unlawful reverse payments. Pfizer's patent settlements
thus involve lawful compromises that appropriately resolve patent
disputes and accelerate patient access to lower cost generics relative
to the expiration of its patents. While Pfizer has been the target of
plaintiff lawyer driven class action lawsuits challenging certain of
its settlements with generic companies, we believe these lawsuits are
without merit and are vigorously asserting the pro-competitive nature
of these settlements in court.
Question. Why would a pharmaceutical company enter into a pay-for-
delay agreement?
Answer. Pfizer does not enter into these types of settlements and
cannot speculate on why others might.
Question. Do you think these agreements stifle competition and
prevent generic alternatives to your branded medications?
Answer. Pfizer's patent settlements do not ``stifle competition''
or ``prevent generic alternatives.'' On the contrary, when Pfizer
settles patent litigation with generic firms, it does so on terms that
generally enable entry of generic competition earlier than the
expiration of its patents and that do not involve unlawful reverse
payments. Pfizer's patent settlements thus involve lawful compromises
that accelerate patient access to lower cost generics relative to the
expiration of its patents.
drug rebate rule
Question. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services'
(HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) promulgated a new regulation to
remove regulatory safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback
Statute (AKS) for rebates on prescription drugs rebates paid by
manufactures to PBMs under Medicare Part D and for Medicaid managed
care organizations (MCOs). The OIG proposal attempts to ban most
rebates by eliminating their regulatory protections.
The rule is predicted to increase net drug costs in its early
years. The CMS actuaries estimate it would cost $196 billion over 10
years. Despite this high price tag, the beneficiary benefits are
limited. The proposed rule notes that under the CMS Actuary's analysis,
the majority of beneficiaries would see an increase in their total out-
of-pocket payments and premium costs; reductions in total cost sharing
will exceed total premium increases.
I wanted to ask a question about the administration's rebate rule,
which I understand that many of the drug manufacturers, and your main
trade association, strongly support. According to an analysis of the
rule by the Office of Actuaries at CMS, drug manufacturers are likely
to initially retain 15 percent of the current rebates as higher net
drug prices.
Given that estimate, can you provide the committee with any
assurances that prices will not increase under this proposed rule?
Answer. If finalized, the rule could result in lower out-of-pocket
patient costs at the pharmacy counter and help address the perverse
incentives in the system that have been contributing to higher list
prices for medicines. In 2019, Pfizer expects to pay billions of
dollars in rebates to ensure patients with pharmacy benefits coverage
in Medicare Part D and patients in commercial plans have access to our
medicines. If the proposed rule to share rebates with consumers at the
point of sale is finalized, we estimate that seniors taking Pfizer
medicines could save $270 on average per year, and up to $574 per year
for certain Pfizer medicines, through lower cost sharing.
Importantly, we believe any reform should apply to all market
segments as this could also lead to further reduction in list prices. A
bifurcated market in which we eliminate rebates in government programs
but maintain rebates for commercial plans will make it difficult for
manufacturers to reduce list prices because a single list price applies
to all markets.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
Question. According to an article recently published in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, medical marketers spent nearly $30
billion dollars in 2016, up from $17 billion in 1997. Direct-to-
Consumer (DTC) advertising had the biggest percentage increase: from
$2.1 billion, or 11.9 percent of all medical marketing, in 1997 to $9.6
billion, or 32 percent of total spending, in 2016.
Can each of you please provide what your ratio of spending on sales
and marketing to research and development is today?
Answer. In order to fulfill Pfizer's mission to create breakthrough
medicines that change patients' lives, we invest in several areas to
ensure an innovative pipeline, top-quality manufacturing, and education
of patients and physicians to ensure they have the information they
need to make knowledgeable decisions about patient care.
In 2018, Pfizer spent approximately $6.9 billion on direct sales
and marketing and approximately $8 billion on research and development
globally.
biosimilars/rebate traps
Question. In many of your testimonies, you mention that encouraging
the development of generics and biosimilars will help bring down the
cost of drugs. However, while 17 biosimilars are now approved in the
US, only 7 are actually on the market and available to patients. There
are growing concerns about rebate traps, which are ways of gaming the
system to ensure a biosimilar is not able to enter the market.
Dr. Bourla, in your testimony, you said: ``Adverse incentives that
favor higher cost originator biologics are keeping biosimilars from
reaching patients. In many cases, payers decline to include lower cost
biosimilars or generics in their formularies because they would risk
losing the rebates they can get by covering higher cost medicines.''
Your company has filed lawsuits challenging rebate traps as antitrust
violations. What do you think should be done about these rebate
practices?
Answer. Anticompetitive conduct should be stopped through
government enforcement of the antitrust laws and in the courts. Brand-
name biologic companies should not be permitted to abuse the rebate
system to effectively block lower-cost biosimilars from coverage
For more details, see Pfizer's Exhibit 4 attached.
price-gouging
Question. Sanofi, as I understand it, has made a pledge to the
public to limit its price increases to the national health expenditures
growth projection.
Would your company commit to a cap on annual price increases as
part of your PhRMA membership criteria?
Answer. We are unable to answer this question as it requires
analysis under the antitrust laws.
Question. What policies would you propose to help ensure lower
launch prices for new drugs?
Answer. At Pfizer, we are committed to our purpose: breakthroughs
that change patients' lives. Pfizer's more than 90,000 colleagues
around the world come to work every day focused not only on creating
breakthrough medicines, but also on making sure those medicines get
into the hands of the patients who need them.
The launch prices for our medicines reflect the value that they
bring to patients and society. The relationship between the price of a
medicine and a patient's out-of-pocket cost is not always clear. Out-
of-pocket costs continue to rise due to insurance designs that place a
disproportionate burden on consumers who use medicines than other
interventions. Consumers on average pay 15 percent of medicine costs
but only 2 percent of hospitalization and other health-care costs. We
encourage Congress to continue its efforts to understand the complexity
of the pricing and reimbursement system in the United States, and to
identify ways in which patient out-of-pocket expenditures can be
reduced.
transparency
Question. In many of your testimonies, you mentioned that the
current system of pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) back-end rebates do
not rarely results in a scenario where the PBM passes on savings to
consumers at the point of sale (POS). The administration recently
proposed a rule to eliminate the anti-kickback statute safe harbor
protections for these drug rebates.
Do you agree that greater transparency should be required to
understand how manufacturers and PBMs are negotiating prices and
rebates to ensure that savings are passed down to beneficiaries?
Answer. Pfizer is committed to working toward greater transparency
along the supply chain, so patients can better understand what they are
paying for and why. We believe pricing transparency policies should
seek to inform consumers about the costs of health-care items and
services across the industry and should promote a definition of value
that considers impact to health and costs over time and across all
industry stakeholders.
Pfizer believes that the proposed safe harbors lay the groundwork
for the systemic change needed to create a simpler, more cost
effective, and more transparent U.S. health-care system, and we are
committed to operating in this new system.
Question. Senator Thune asked if this administration rule would
lead you to lowering list prices. Both of you answered that you would
be likely to lower your prices. However, if this rule were finalized
tomorrow as proposed, would any of your companies be required to lower
the list price of any of your drugs?
Answer. As long as rebate reform extends to both the commercial
market and government programs, there could be a reduction in list
prices. The commercial market covers more than 50 percent of Americans
with insurance, and the safe harbor will not affect it at all. However,
in Medicare, the rebate rule will make list prices less relevant
because the entire rebate will be converted to a point of sale discount
so that patient out-of-pocket costs, when they are in the deductible,
coinsurance, and coverage gap phases of the benefit, will be based off
the lower net price. If we ensure that rebates paid out to commercial
plans find their way to patients, the patients will see savings of
hundreds of dollars.
pbms
Question. An Axios article from March 7, 2019 highlights the fact
that, while ``pharmaceutical companies put a lot of the blame for high
drug prices on pharmacy benefit managers,'' many large pharmaceutical
companies ``rely on PBMs to manage their own health-care benefits.''
In your role as an employer, does your company contract with a
pharmaceutical benefit manager (PBM) to administer the prescription
drug benefits for your employees and negotiate lower drug costs on your
behalf?
Answer. Yes, we contract with a PBM to administer our prescription
drug benefits and we work with them to establish criteria for
negotiating lower drug costs on our employees' behalf.
Question. For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the
prescription drug benefit for your employees, how do you utilize the
rebates your PBM negotiates to lower health-care costs or drug costs
for your employee plans, and what does your company do with that
savings? Specifically, do the savings go toward lowering premiums?
Answer. Pfizer's medical and prescription drug coverage is generous
in terms of what we subsidize as an employer; therefore we work to
ensure that our employees benefit from our investment in our workforce
and any savings in the form of affordable plan premiums and
substantially lower cost sharing responsibilities for prescription
drugs.
Question. For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the
prescription drug benefit for your employees, does your PBM offer
point-of-sale rebates to your employees?
Answer. Pfizer's plan design is generous and corresponding employee
cost sharing responsibility for prescription drugs is already very
limited--in fact, for many products, Pfizer employees experience no
cost sharing at all. Given this, the terms of contract with our PBM for
our employee benefits does not include a requirement to pass on rebates
to Pfizer employees at the point of sale.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse
Question. Please describe any policy changes you support that would
result in your company lowering the list prices of its drugs.
Answer. Pfizer would support legislation that reforms the current
system of rebating to one in which payers are required to use
manufacturer provided discounts to ensure that the patient gets the
benefit of the discount at the point of sale. We support this reform
across all segments of the market where private sector negotiations
result in lower net prices including Medicare Part D, Medicaid managed
care and the commercial markets. It is important to understand that
even if rebates are prohibited, manufacturers will still negotiate
discounts with plans consistent with safe harbors in exchange for
formulary access, though those discounts will be reflected in lowered
drug prices at the pharmacy counter rather than retrospective payments
benefitting plans or their PBM instead of the beneficiaries who are
underwriting premiums for others.
To ensure these benefits reach patients, it will be important for
Congress and the administration to ensure that plans do not create new
barriers or restrictions that hinder patient access and undermine the
spirit of the rule.
Question. How much does your company's research and development
portfolio rely on taxpayer-funded research conducted by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH)?
Answer. The biopharmaceutical industry is one of the most research-
intensive industries in the United States. In 2017, NIH had a budget of
$39.2 billion, only a fraction of which, $3.2 billion, was dedicated to
drug discovery. The industry invested over $90 billion in R&D--almost
30 times more. For Pfizer alone, we invested approximately $8 billion
in R&D last year.
NIH's strength is its focus on important basic scientific research
and the industry does derive important insights from basic scientific
research conducted by NIH-funded researchers and scientists worldwide.
There is, however, a large gap between understanding basic scientific
principles and the discovery, development, and delivery of medicines to
patients. For example, the initial NIH-funded basic science discovery
of cell division and cell signaling proteins in yeast led researchers
to identify similar proteins in humans. This early research later
informed the thinking of Pfizer scientists and helped pave the way for
the discovery and development of targeted cancer drugs like
palbociclib, a new treatment for breast cancer.
The discovery of cell division in yeast is a long way from
discovering and developing a drug that prevents cancer tumors from
growing. As stated above, the government plays a role in advancing
basic science such as identifying cellular pathways underlying disease.
However, the ability to translate knowledge about biological processes
into a medicine or vaccine, with appropriate drug-like properties and a
clinically meaningful benefit, remains the primary function of the
biopharmaceutical industry. The drug discovery and development process
involves harnessing existing knowledge of underlying disease biology to
chart and execute a research agenda that often encompasses ten to 15
years of discovery research, preclinical testing, clinical development
(for dosing, safety, and efficacy) and pharmaceutical science to ensure
the quality of the compound to be delivered. Disciplines like medicinal
chemistry, process and formulation chemistry and formulation, drug
metabolism, pharmacokinetics and safety sciences are practiced at a
scale and expertise in the biopharmaceutical industry that extends well
beyond government and academic research endeavors to deliver life-
savings therapies for patients.
Question. How many of your company's products are based, at least
in part, on NIH research, and how many are the result of research
funded solely by your company?
Answer. We have not identified readily available information in
response to this request that is maintained in the ordinary course of
business. We would need to discuss the scope and terms of this question
with your staff to respond appropriately.
Question. In each of the last 5 years, how much has your company
spent on research and development versus the advertising and marketing
of your products?
Answer. In order to fulfill Pfizer's mission to create breakthrough
medicines that change patients' lives, we invest in several areas to
ensure an innovative pipeline, top-quality manufacturing, and education
of patients and physicians to ensure they have the information they
need to make knowledgeable decisions about patient care.
Over the last 5 years, Pfizer spent approximately $34 billion on
advertising and marketing and approximately $40 billion on R&D
globally. Advertising and marketing expenses include advertising,
promotion and field selling.
Question. During the hearing, you mentioned that your company would
be likely to lower the list prices of its drugs if the recent proposal
by the Trump administration to change the current system of rebates was
extended to the private market.
If the policy was extended to the private market, how large would
the list price reductions be relative to the size of the rebates your
company is currently providing?
Answer. The size of any list price reductions relative to the size
of rebates Pfizer is currently providing would depend on all components
of the final rule and how the point of sale discount model that
replaces rebates will function.
Question. How will this proposal affect how your company sets the
list prices for new drug products?
Answer. At Pfizer, we are committed to our purpose: breakthroughs
that change patients' lives. Pfizer's more than 90,000 colleagues
around the world come to work every day focused not only on creating
breakthrough medicines, but also on making sure those medicines get
into the hands of the patients who need them.
Launch pricing is driven by a multitude of factors, the most
important being the medicine's impact on patients and their health. We
also may consider other factors like the medicine's potential to reduce
other health-care costs, such as hospital stays; the availability of
other treatments and generic options; affordability for patients,
insurers and governments; and investments to maintain the quality,
safety, delivery and reliability of our medicines.
Question. If the proposal is finalized and not extended to the
private market, will your company make any list price reductions? If
so, how large would the reductions be relative to the size of the
rebates your company is currently providing?
Answer. Because there is no specific requirement for plans and PBMs
to shift away from negotiating contracted rebates in the commercial
market, it is possible that a bifurcated market, with the same perverse
incentives and the same mechanism to drive list prices higher, will
result. If reform does extend to the commercial marketplace, it could
result in lowering of list prices. However, we cannot speculate on the
amounts until we see the specifics of the rule and the changes that are
made to the supply chain.
______
Question Submitted by Hon. Maggie Hassan
Question. In June of 2018, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access
Commission (MACPAC) unanimously recommended under Recommendation 1.1 in
their annual report to Congress that Congress remove the statutory
requirement that manufacturers blend the average manufacturer price
(AMP) of a brand drug and its authorized generic.\12\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\12\ MACPAC: ``Improving Operations of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program,'' https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Improving-
Operations-of-the-Medicaid-Drug-Rebate-Program.pdf.
This requirement created an unintended loophole. Rather than use
the price of the authorized generic, drug companies can sell its
authorized generic to a corporate subsidiary at an artificially lower
price, and use that lower price to bring down the AMP, which in turn
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
lowers the rebate obligation.
Does your company engage in this practice? Has your company ever
engaged in this practice in the past?
Answer. Pfizer has a number of Authorized Generics (AGs)
arrangements, both with affiliates and non-affiliates. CMS's Medicaid
Covered Outpatient Drugs Final Rule, 81 Fed. Reg. 5170 (Feb. 1, 2016)
(the ``Final Rule'') included an extensive discussion of when a primary
manufacturer should include or exclude sales of AGs to secondary
manufacturers in its average manufacturer price (AMP). Pfizer has
developed reasonable assumptions that it believes are consistent with
the guidance CMS set forth in the Final Rule for purposes of
determining when to include or exclude sales of AGs in its AMP
calculation. Pfizer disclosed its assumptions with respect to its
approach both in written correspondence and in an onsite meeting with
CMS representatives. In addition, Pfizer disclosed its assumptions to
the OIG in response to a January 2018 survey.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
Question. According to public filings, in 2015 Pfizer collected
U.S. revenues that were more than double the amount you invested in
R&D. Is this still true--do you collect more in revenue in the U.S.
alone than you invest in R&D?
Answer. The biopharmaceutical industry is one of the most research-
intensive industries in the United States In 2017, NIH had a budget of
$39.2 billion, only a fraction of which, $3.2 billion, was dedicated to
drug discovery. The industry invested over $90 billion in R&D--almost
30 times more. For Pfizer alone, we invested approximately $8 billion
in R&D last year.
Pfizer's number one priority is always the care of our patients,
and we are proud of the investments Pfizer makes to insure we continue
to bring new, innovative cures to patients. These responsibilities
require investments in R&D, manufacturing and other areas to accomplish
our mission of creating breakthrough medicines that change people's
lives.
In 2018, Pfizer spent approximately $20 billion on global R&D and
manufacturing. This includes investing in state-of-the-art labs so we
can attract the finest scientists in the world and continuing to invest
in innovative, high-tech manufacturing to ensure the high quality of
our products. Pfizer's revenues in the United States in 2018 totaled
approximately $25 billion.
Question. As a portion of your revenue, for what percentage of the
drugs in your portfolio do you offer no rebates? Based on the drugs in
your pipeline, do you foresee that portion growing? For those drugs is
your list price equal to your net price?
Answer. Approximately one third of Pfizer's revenue comes from
products that are not Medicare Part D eligible. This product group
includes generics, vaccines, and physician administered products. Of
the remaining two thirds of our revenue, 92 percent comes from products
that offer Medicare Part D or commercial rebates. The remaining 8
percent is from products that have lost patent exclusivity, have
generic alternatives, and offer no rebates. It is not possible to
determine at this time whether that portion will increase because
rebating on future products will be based on numerous factors,
including product value and the competitive intensity of the
therapeutic area. For products that do not rebate, there are additional
deductions from sales such as prompt payment fees and distribution
service fees resulting in the net price being lower than list price.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you generate in U.S. sales
revenue? Please include specific figures.
Answer. The biopharmaceutical industry is one of the most research-
intensive industries in the United States In 2017, NIH had a budget of
$39.2 billion, only a fraction of which, $3.2 billion, was dedicated to
drug discovery. The industry invested over $90 billion in R&D--almost
30 times more. For Pfizer alone, we invested approximately $8 billion
in R&D last year.
Pfizer's number one priority is always the care of our patients,
and we are proud of the investments Pfizer makes to insure we continue
to bring new, innovative cures to patients. These responsibilities
require investments in R&D, manufacturing and other areas to accomplish
our mission of creating breakthrough medicines that change people's
lives.
In 2018, Pfizer's revenues in the United States totaled
approximately $25 billion and Pfizer spent approximately $20 billion on
global R&D and manufacturing. This includes investing in state-of-the-
art labs so we can attract the finest scientists in the world and
continuing to invest in innovative, high-tech manufacturing to ensure
the high quality of our products.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
administration? What company functions do you consider to be included
in administration? Please include specific figures.
Answer. In order to fulfill Pfizer's mission to create breakthrough
medicines that change patients' lives, we invest in several areas to
ensure an innovative pipeline, top-quality manufacturing, and education
of patients and physicians to ensure they have the information they
need to make knowledgeable decisions about patient care.
In 2018, Pfizer spent approximately $14 billion on selling,
informational and administrative expenses and approximately $8 billion
on R&D. Selling, informational and administrative costs are expensed as
incurred. Among other things, these expenses include the internal and
external costs of marketing, advertising, shipping and handling,
information technology and legal defense.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
sales? What company functions do you consider to be included in sales?
Please include specific figures.
Answer. In order to fulfill Pfizer's mission to create breakthrough
medicines that change patients' lives, we invest in several areas to
ensure an innovative pipeline, top-quality manufacturing, and education
of patients and physicians to ensure they have the information they
need to make knowledgeable decisions about patient care.
In 2018, Pfizer spent approximately $6.9 billion on direct sales &
marketing and approximately $8 billion on R&D globally. Direct sales
and marketing expenses include, among other things: direct promotion or
sale of the company's products.
Question. Why do you advertise for the drugs you manufacture? What
factors do you consider in choosing which drugs you advertise?
Answer. Pfizer believes that direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising
should be, first and foremost, a tool through which we can provide
patients with useful information about their medical conditions, the
availability of treatments and the potential benefits and risks of
available treatment options so they can have a discussion with their
doctors and take an active role in managing their health. Research has
confirmed that this communication channel delivers on this goal.\13\

Dear Dr. Gottlieb:
We write in reference to the newly posted page on the FDA website
entitled ``Reference Listed Drug (RLD) Access Inquiries.'' \1\ We note
that several new drug applications (NDAs) owned by Pfizer Inc. or
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Pfizer (collectively, ``Pfizer'') are
included in the list published on this site (``List''):
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

022321;
2.
Hemabate (carboprost tromethamine), NDA 01 7989; and
3.
Tikosyn (dofetilide), NDA 020931.
We write to the Agency for several reasons. First, we wish to inform
the Agency about Pfizer's internal practice for handling drug
purchasing inquiries from prospective generic applicants, as well as
provide some context for why the Agency may have received inquiries
about these particular products, and Pfizer's diligence in addressing
these issues. We believe that this information demonstrates Pfizer's
commitment to supporting innovation and a competitive marketplace.
Second, we wish to provide our suggestions on additional, non-
confidential information to add to the List in order to provide context
critical to understanding the List and its value. Additionally, we wish
to express our concerns that the Agency's announcement surrounding the
new webpage and how the information is currently presented implies that
the companies listed have engaged in ``gaming'' or anti-competitive
behavior, which is untrue with respect to Pfizer, and not supported by
the facts currently included in the List.
Pfizer was surprised and disappointed to discover that FDA had been
informed by prospective generic applicants that they had difficulty
obtaining some of our products to conduct the testing necessary to
support submission of an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA).
However, we note that the Agency included a disclaimer on the webpage
stating that ``[w]e note that FDA has not independently investigated or
confirmed the access limitations described in the inquiries received.''
\2\ As discussed in more detail below, without having any additional
information about these inquiries, Pfizer is unable to confirm whether
those inquiries were made to Pfizer, and if so, whether they were
handled in accordance with Pfizer's practice to make its drug products
available to applicants for purchase.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/
HowDrugsareDevelopedandAp
proved/ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/
ucm607738.htm.
Following publication of the List, Pfizer conducted internal due
diligence to identify whether Pfizer was contacted by prospective
generic applicants for the listed products, and whether Pfizer was able
to provide those customers with the requested drug product. By way of
background, our standard approach is to ensure that drug product is
available to licensed generic manufacturers at the listed price and on
Pfizer's standard terms of sale.\3\ The vast majority of Pfizer's
products are available through traditional wholesale channels (i.e.,
available through one or more of Pfizer's authorized distributors). If
Pfizer receives an inquiry about a product that is available at
wholesale, Pfizer will refer a prospective buyer to a publicly
available list of its authorized distributors, and indicate that the
prospective buyer should obtain product from an authorized distributor
on that list. For the limited number of products that are not available
at wholesale, requests made to Pfizer by a generic manufacturer wishing
to purchase drug samples should be fulfilled in accordance with
Pfizer's standard practice. If such requests involve a product with a
REMS that restricts distribution, Pfizer's position is that a Safety
Determination Letter (SDL) needs to be provided prior to sale. Pfizer
developed an internal process to handle such requests in early 2015,
upon realizing that such requests come into Pfizer via multiple
departments and colleagues.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ If a drug product is in critical short supply, Pfizer will ship
products to fulfill orders for dispensing to patients before fulfilling
orders for product for testing.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Tikosyn
The List indicated that the Agency had received four inquiries
regarding Tikosyn. To the best of its knowledge, Pfizer is aware of
only one request for Tikosyn from a prospective generic applicant. At
the time of that request, Tikosyn was approved with a REMS with
elements to assure safe use (ETASU) that restricted distribution. When
contacted by the applicant, Pfizer requested that the applicant provide
us with written confirmation from the Agency that Pfizer's sale of the
product to the applicant would not be considered a violation of our
REMS. The applicant did not contact Pfizer further and Pfizer never
received any written correspondence from the Agency. The Agency removed
the REMS in 2016, and Pfizer notes that the Access Inquiries Webpage
indicates that FDA never issued any SDLs for this drug product.
We note despite the inquiries submitted to the Agency identified in the
List, ANDAs have been submitted and approved for the drug product.
There are three approved ANDAs for the drug product, with the first
approved on June 6, 2016,\4\ and two additional ANDAs approved in
2018.\5\ Additionally, the Agency's paragraph IV certification list
indicates that the first ANDA containing a paragraph IV certification
was submitted on May 1, 2014, when the REMS was still in place.\6\ This
additional information indicates that applicants were able to obtain
product, submit ANDAs, and obtain approval from the approval even while
the REMS was in place.

AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/UC
M293268.pdf.
As the REMS has been removed by the Agency, Pfizer now makes Tikosyn
available at wholesale through its authorized distributors.
Embeda
The List indicated that the Agency received one inquiry regarding
Embeda. We note that despite the inquiry submitted to the Agency, ANDAs
containing a paragraph IV certification were submitted to the Agency
for Embeda from May 3, 2010, through May 28, 2010, covering five of the
six approved strengths of Embeda.\7\ Pfizer acquired King
Pharmaceuticals (and with it, Ernbeda) on March 1, 2011. Two weeks
later, Pfizer recalled Embeda from the market due to stability issues
with the product. Pfizer spent the next several years diligently
addressing the issues that led to the recall, and Pfizer was able to
re-launch the product in January 2015. However, as a result of these
issues, from March 2011 through January 2015, there was no Embeda
product available for sale in the U.S. market.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ See https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/
DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDe
velopedandApproved/ApprovalApplications/
AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/UC
M293268.pdf.
Pfizer was not able to identify any request from a generic applicant to
purchase Embeda. Embeda is now available at wholesale through Pfizer's
authorized distributors.
Hemabate
Finally, the List indicated that FDA had received one inquiry for
Hemabate, an older drug owned by Pharmacia and Upjohn Co., which was
acquired by Pfizer in 2003. Pharmacia, and later Pfizer, limited
Hemabate distribution to customers with medical and surgical intensive
care facilities to help ensure the drug product was used in accordance
with the product's labeling. While this limited distribution may have
prevented a prospective generic applicant from acquiring the drug
product from a wholesaler, it would not have prevented an applicant
from contacting Pfizer directly to buy the drug product. Pfizer ceased
the limited distribution of Hemabate to ensure patients and healthcare
professionals had appropriate access to the drug product. The product
is now available at wholesale through Pfizer's authorized distributors
since January 2018. Pfizer was not able to identify any request from a
generic applicant to purchase Hemabate.
Proposed Revisions to the List
We encourage the Agency, in accordance with its goal ``[t]o help
address this issue and to provide transparency regarding these
inquiries,'' \8\ to add further information to the List. The
information Pfizer suggests the Agency include will provide critical
context to help clarify to the stakeholders involved, i.e., the
American public, the United States Government, and industry, whether an
NDA bolder may be preventing generic applicants from obtaining the drug
products necessary to support submission of an ANDA Without this
information, stakeholders may come away with the false impression that
every company on the List has impeded access, as demonstrated by the
news coverage of the List and FDA's statements.\9\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
We recommend that the List include:

The date the inquiry was made to FDA, and if furnished by the
prospective generic applicant, the date(s) the applicant attempted to
acquire the drug product and failed;

If available, whether the prospective generic applicant directly
approached the NDA holder or manufacturer , and was unable to obtain
product that way;

The identity of the NDA holder at the time the inquiry was made;

Whether there are approved generic products for the drug
product, and when those were approved;

Whether and when an applicant submitted an ANDA with paragraph
IV certification; and

Whether a particular inquiry for a product with a REMS with
ETASU restricting distribution included a protocol, and whether the
Agency issued an SDL relating to that inquiry.
While the Agency includes a disclaimer on the Access Inquiries Webpage
that it has not investigated or confirmed the access limitations
described in the inquiries it received,\10\ the Agency's statements,
both on its website and in public statements, strongly suggest that the
Agency endorses the claim that access to biosamples was blocked for all
products on the list. In reality, however, the only certain fact about
the inquiries on the List is that a prospective applicant complained to
FDA that it was unable to obtain the drug product. Neither Pfizer nor
the FDA knows whether that is in fact the case, or, if it is, whether
there are reasons the applicant did not obtain product that are not the
result of ``gaming'' or anti-competitive tactics by NDA holders. For
example, the drug may not be available due to a drug shortage, recall
(as in the case of Embeda), or because the generic applicant did not
actually try all avenues to obtain the drug product, such as contacting
the NOA holder or manufacturer directly.

htm.
Including this additional information in the List will shed light on
the reasons the generic applicant may have been w1able to obtain the
drug product, as well as indicate whether generic applicants were able
to obtain the drug product, despite the inquiries received by FDA. For
example, knowing the dates the inquiries were made could indicate
whether the requests came during a time when the drug product was not
being marketed, as in a recall situation, or when a REMS with ETASU
that restricted distribution was in place that may have triggered the
need for a review of the prospective generic applicant's protocol. And,
knowing those dates will help industry perform its own due diligence to
identify whether a request for drug product was inappropriately denied.
Likewise, noting whether the prospective generic applicant stated
whether it contacted the NDA holder or manufacturer will indicate
whether the applicant reached out to a party that could provide the
drug product, and will assist a company in determining whether its
policy on providing drug product, such as Pfizer's, was appropriately
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
followed.
Additionally, providing the identity of the NDA holder at the time of
the inquiry will help clarify whether the company that currently owns
the NDA could potentially be responsible for the failure to provide
drug product, or whether that failure, if any, could be attributable to
the prior holder of the NDA. For example, without knowing when the
inquiry was made or who the NDA holder was at the time of the inquiry,
Pfizer cannot tell for two of its products on the List (Embeda and
Hemabate) whether those inquiries came before or after Pfizer's
acquisition of the companies that originally owned those
products.Accordingly, Pfizer cannot adequately respond to allegations
that it may have inappropriately restricted access to its drug
products.
Including the dates of generic entry would also demonstrate to
stakeholders whether generic competition was impeded, or if in fact,
one or more generic applicants were able to obtain the product needed
in order to obtain approval from the Agency. While we recognize that
the Agency may be unable to identify who made the inquiry to FDA, even
if that applicant has an ANDA approved later, to the extent that
information can be provided, it would demonstrate whether a particular
generic applicant was blocked from obtaining product.
Additionally, providing more information related to products with REMS
that restrict distribution, e.g., whether an applicant has submitted a
protocol to the Agency, and whether a particular inquiry on the List
correlates to the issuance of an SOL, will also indicate whether the
generic applicant who made the inquiry provided its protocol to the
Agency, and whether the Agency determined that the protocol contained
safety protections comparable to the REMS. Currently, there is no
indication as to whether an applicant who complained about not having
access to such drug product took appropriate steps to facilitate its
access to the product when there was such a REMS in place for the drug
product.
Finally, we also note that the Agency does not inform an NOA holder in
real time when an applicant has had difficulty obtaining product. Given
Pfizer's policy to provide drug product when requested, if the Agency
had informed Pfizer that it had received such an inquiry on a specific
date, Pfizer could have then undertaken its own efforts to resolve the
issue.
We appreciate the Agency's consideration of the issues raised in this
letter, and reiterate our commitment to competition and innovation in
the biopharmaceutical industry.

Dear Dr. Honig:
Thank you for your letter of May 30, 2018, regarding FDA's Reference
Listed Drug (RLD) Access Inquiries webpage. Your letter informs FDA
about Pfizer's internal practice for handling inquiries about samples
from prospective generic applicants, provides suggestions about
additional information to add to the RLD Access Inquiries webpage, and
expresses concern about the Agency's announcement surrounding the
webpage (Letter at 1-2). The Commissioner referred your letter to the
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) for response.
1.
Pfizer's internal practice for handling drug purchasing
inquiries from prospective generic applicants
Your letter provides a synopsis of Pfizer's internal practices for
handling the inquiries that it receives related to RLD access to its
products and the circumstances surrounding the Pfizer products that
appear on the RLD Access Inquiries webpage (Letter at 2-3). We
appreciate the insight provided by Pfizer on its internal processes. As
you are aware, inclusion on the list of products on the RLD Access
Inquiries webpage signifies that FDA has received an RLD access inquiry
related to limited distribution of the product. As we state on the
webpage, FDA has not independently investigated or confirmed the access
limitations as described in the inquiries received.
You also state that FDA ``does not inform an NDA holder in real time
when an applicant has had difficulty obtaining product'' and that ``if
[FDA] had informed Pfizer that it had received such an inquiry on a
specific date, Pfizer could have then undertaken its own efforts to
resolve the issue.'' As the webpage explains (and as also described in
the draft guidance for industry How to Obtain a Letter from FDA Stating
that Bioequivalence Study Protocols Contain Safety Protections
Comparable to Applicable REMS for RLD (How to Obtain a Letter
Guidance)), FDA does notify certain RLD sponsors, after the prospective
generic applicant has provided appropriate disclosure authorization to
the Agency. However, to the extent that Pfizer has a process for
prospective generic applicants to obtain samples, we encourage Pfizer
to consider making that process public to help ensure both that
interested developers know what process to use, and that Pfizer has
access to as much information as possible about any access issues.
2.
Suggestions for additional information Pfizer believes FDA
should add to the RLD Access Inquiries webpage
Your letter also contains a list of six points of information Pfizer
recommends be added to the RLD Access web page (Letter at 4):
1.
The date the inquiry was made to FDA, and (if furnished
by the prospective generic applicant), the date(s) the
applicant attempted to acquire the product and failed;
2.
If available, whether the prospective generic applicant
directly approached the NDA bolder or manufacturer, and was
unable to obtain product that way;
3.
The identity of the NDA holder at the time the inquiry
was made;
4.
Whether there are approved generic products for the drug
product, and when those were approved;
5.
Whether and when an applicant submitted an ANDA with a
paragraph IV certification; and
6.
Whether a particular inquiry for a product with a REMS
with ETASU impacting distribution included a protocol, and
whether the Agency issued a Safety Determination Letter (SDL)
relating to that inquiry.
We note that two of these items (``[t]he identity of the NDA holder at
the time the inquiry was made,'' and ``whether the Agency issued a
[Safety Determination Letter] relating to [an] inquiry'') are already
included on the RLD Access Inquiries webpage. The webpage identifies
the RLD sponsor associated with each inquiry, and clarifies that this
is the RLD sponsor that was listed in the Approved Drug Products with
Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) at the time FDA
received the inquiry (see footnote on the chart of inquiries). The web
page also identifies whether FDA issued a Safety Determination Letter
in connection with a particular RLD access inquiry (and explains that
receipt of such a letter is preceded by FDA' s review of bioequivalence
study protocols to assess whether they contain safety protections
comparable to those in the applicable REMS for the RLD).
Two of the other points of information (``[w]hether there are approved
generic products for the drug product, and when those were approved''
and ``[w]hether an applicant submitted an ANDA with a paragraph IV
certification'') are already publicly available on FDA's website (via
the Orange Book or [email protected] and the Paragraph IV Certifications List,
respectively).\1\ For the remaining points of information, to the
extent FDA has access to the information you describe, we will take
your feedback (along with feedback from other stakeholders) into
account as we consider whether any changes to the RLD Access Inquiries
webpage should be made in order to best address and improve
transparency about this topic.

3.
Concerns relating to the Agency's announcement surrounding the
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
RLD Access Inquiries webpage
Your letter also indicates that FDA's presentation of information about
this topic ``strongly suggest that the Agency endorses the claim that
access to biosamples was blocked for all products on the list'' (Letter
at 4). As you note, however, the RLD Access webpage makes clear that
FDA has not independently investigated or confirmed the access
limitations described in the inquiries the Agency received. The webpage
is one effort under the FDA's Drug Competition Action Plan to provide
transparency about the potential impact of this important issue. If
generic companies are unable to purchase the samples they need to
support their applications, this slows down, or entirely impedes, the
generic drug development process--leading to delays in bringing
affordable generic alternatives to patients in need. FDA is committed
to advancing policies to help bring more competition to the
prescription drug market, and we will continue to consider how we can
best advance this goal, including whether any changes to the RLD Access
Inquiries webpage should be made. We appreciate your feedback on this
issue.
Thank you again for contacting us.

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
EASTERN DISTRICT OF PENNSYLVANIA
PFIZER INC., Plaintiff,
Case No.
v.
JURY TRIAL DEMANDED
JOHNSON & JOHNSON and JANSSEN
BIOTECH, INC., Defendants.
COMPLAINT
For its Complaint, plaintiff Pfizer Inc. (``Pfizer'') alleges
against defendants Johnson & Johnson and Janssen Biotech, Inc.
(collectively, ``J&J''), as follows:
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
1. It is accepted national policy to promote price competition
among pharmaceutical manufacturers after an originator firm's patent
protection has expired. This policy extends to biologics, a unique
category of medications that are derived from living organisms. As one
lawmaker put it when adopting applicable legislation, such competition
``is good for patient safety, consumer choice . . . and the healthcare
system at large.'' This case is about J&J's efforts to suppress that
competition and deprive society of those benefits by, among other
things, imposing a web of exclusionary contracts on both health
insurers and healthcare providers (e.g., hospitals and clinics) to
maintain its stranglehold in respect of an important biologic, brand
named Remicade, also known by its generic name, infliximab.
2. For many patients suffering from chronic diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis, plaque psoriasis, and Crohn's disease, the best--
and sometimes the only--option for treatment is infusion therapy with
infliximab. As these conditions are chronic in nature, patients often
require long-term treatment and multiple infusions per year.
3. J&J owned patents protecting infliximab and has been amply
rewarded for its invention: Between 1998 and 2016, Remicade was the
only infliximab product on the market. This position allowed Remicade
to become J&J's best-selling drug by far, generating about $4.8 billion
in U.S. sales in 2016 alone. In fact, Remicade is among the best
selling drugs in the world. For most uses, at list price Remicade sells
for about $4,000 per infused dose and about $26,000 for a full year of
treatment. When Pfizer introduced its competing biologic Inflectra
(infliximab-dyyb) in 2016, J&J deployed improper exclusionary tactics
to maintain the dominance of its flagship product.
4. Inflectra received marketing approval under the Biologics Price
Competition and Innovation Act (``BPCIA''). Congress recognized the
growing importance of biologics, as well as the growing costs
associated with them, and passed the BPCIA in 2010. The purpose of the
BPCIA, as its name suggests, is to foster meaningful price competition
for long-entrenched branded biologic products--with the ultimate goal
of lowering healthcare costs. To facilitate price competition, the
BPCIA provides an abbreviated FDA approval pathway for ``biosimilar''
versions of branded biologic drugs. Biosimilars are products that the
FDA has determined to have ``no clinically meaningful differences''
from the already approved biologic (sometimes referred to as the
``reference listed drug'' or ``RLD'') in terms of safety, purity, and
potency. Although the BPCIA was enacted in 2010, FDA procedures for
implementing the Act did not become effective until a few years later,
and biosimilars are only recently beginning to come onto the market,
with the first biosimilar approval in 2015.
5. On April 5, 2016, Inflectra received FDA approval as the first
biosimilar to Remicade. Pfizer began shipping Inflectra in November
2016 and set its initial list price, often referred to as the wholesale
acquisition cost (or ``WAC''), at 15 percent below the then-current WAC
of Remicade.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ WAC is the manufacturer's published list price to wholesalers
or direct purchasers, not including prompt pay or other discounts,
rebates, or reductions in price.
6. The threat from Inflectra did not go unnoticed by J&J. Within
weeks of Inflectra's launch, J&J began to deploy what it publicly has
termed its ``Biosimilar Readiness Plan.'' The core features of the plan
are exclusionary contracts that foreclose Pfizer's access to an
overwhelming share of consumers, coupled with anticompetitive bundling
and coercive rebate policies designed to block both insurers from
reimbursing, and hospitals and clinics from purchasing, Inflectra or
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
other biosimilars of Remicade despite their lower pricing.
7. J&J's actions with respect to Remicade exclude competition at
multiple levels:
8. Exclusive contracts with insurance company payers. Insurer
decisions regarding reimbursement policies have a dramatic impact on
which infliximab product will be stocked by healthcare providers such
as hospitals and clinics. Because providers administer infliximab on
site (it is an infusion product), they must use their own funds to
stock the product, purchasing it for later use and relying upon
subsequent reimbursement from insurers to recoup their expenses. Given
the cost of biologic drugs generally, and Remicade in particular, there
is almost no chance that providers will pay for a product that is not
widely covered by insurers for fear of stocking a product that will not
be reimbursed after the provider administers it to a patient, as even a
single unreimbursed dose may cost the provider in excess of $4,000.
 Recognizing this, J&J has induced insurers to enter into
contracts that require an explicit commitment not to cover Inflectra at
all or to do so only in the rarest of circumstances--in effect, to make
Remicade the only covered infliximab. As a direct result of these
exclusive dealing contractual commitments, Inflectra is either not
listed on the insurance company's medical policy--a published listing
of the drugs approved for reimbursement under the insurer's medical
benefit--or is designated reimbursable only in so-called ``fail first''
cases. The ``fail first'' exception, which requires that Remicade has
been tried by and failed with respect to a given patient before a
biosimilar infliximab can be reimbursed, is medically inappropriate and
illusory in practice. If Remicade, which is an infliximab product, does
not work for a patient, a physician would turn to a non-infliximab
drug, not to Inflectra, which also is an infliximab product and has no
clinically meaningful differences from Remicade. The spurious nature of
J&J's ``fail first'' restriction is illustrated by the fact that in
early 2017, before J&J's contracts took hold, the major insurers listed
Inflectra at parity with Remicade--indicating that they saw no medical
reason to favor one over the other.
 J&J's ``fail first'' contractual restrictions therefore have the
same practical effect as pure exclusive contracts: both operate to
exclude Inflectra from qualifying for reimbursement under the insurers'
plans; both prevent the insurer from freely reimbursing for Inflectra
or another biosimilar without breaching the contracts; and both
foreclose Inflectra from competing for patients covered by those plans.
J&J has entered into such contracts with all or nearly all national
health insurance companies. These ``biosimilar-exclusion'' contracts,
on their own, have foreclosed Inflectra's ability to vie for at least
70 percent of commercially insured patients in the United States,
including a significant number of commercially insured patients who
reside in the Philadelphia area. But the foreclosure effects of those
insurer contracts go well beyond the immediate impact on patients
covered by the affected plans, as discussed below.
9. Exclusionary rebates and bundling arrangements with insurance
company payers. A key to J&J's ability to coerce insurers into
accepting its exclusionary commitments is its denial of rebates to
insurers that decline J&J's exclusivity commitments, thereby imposing a
substantial financial penalty. In effect, J&J says to insurers, ``If
you want to receive attractive rebates on Remicade for all your
existing Remicade patients''--rebates which, for some insurers, run
into the tens of millions of dollars annually--``you must agree to not
reimburse for Inflectra, or to do so in the most limited of
circumstances.'' In short, insurers that decline J&J's offer face a
substantial financial penalty, and those that accept receive a payoff
(multimillion dollar rebate payments) in return for their commitment to
exclude biosimilars.
 J&J's threatened financial penalty is effective because there is
a substantial base of patients across the country who are already
controlling their diseases with Remicade and thus are unlikely to
switch to a lower-priced biosimilar once available. Although
biosimilars have no clinically meaningful differences in safety,
purity, and potency from the biologic originator, they are not
substitutable without the prescriber's approval (unlike generics for
non-biologic drugs approved under the Hatch-Waxman structure, which are
substitutable without a new prescription). And, although the FDA's
approval permits physicians to switch from the originator to the
biosimilar, and Pfizer believes they should consider doing so in
appropriate circumstances, as a practical matter, existing-patient
Remicade demand is economically incontestable, that is, not a realistic
candidate for biosimilar firms to compete for. As the head of J&J's
pharmaceuticals business told investors, ``the 70 percent of patients
who are [already] stable on Remicade are highly unlikely to switch.''
\2\ J&J bundles this economically ``incontestable'' demand for Remicade
with the portion of demand that is ``contestable'' for biosimilar
firms-- new patients starting therapy with infliximab--by threatening
to deny rebates on all Remicade prescriptions if any infliximab
biosimilar prescriptions are reimbursed, effectively meaning insurers
would have to forfeit their rebates and pay J&J's ever increasing price
for the incontestable patients.

 J&J also bundles rebates on multiple different products, such
that insurers that refuse to grant exclusivity to Remicade would be
forced to pay higher prices and/or forego enhanced portfolio rebates.
The net effect of these anticompetitive bundling practices is that the
insurers subject to them have no real choice but to agree to J&J's
exclusivity conditions. Insurers have made it clear to Pfizerthat its
net cost for Inflectrawould need to be low enough to offset the loss of
J&J rebates. Pfizer and other biosimilar firms cannot feasibly make up
the difference for the J&J rebates (on the existing Remicade patient
base) that insurers would lose if they declined J&J's conditions.
Insurers have stated a desire to support biosimilars--and the lower
per-unit prices they bring--but realistically cannot do so without
incurring a substantial financial penalty imposed by J&J and thus
potentially placing themselves at a disadvantage relative to insurers
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
accepting J&J's rebates.
10. J&J-engineered coverage restrictions impact provider purchasing
behavior and thus magnify foreclosure. The foreclosure created by J&J's
exclusionary insurer-level contracts goes well beyond the patients
covered by these health insurers: Inflectra's coverage status has a
spillover effect on the purchasing decisions of healthcare providers
(as noted, the clinics, hospitals, and other institutions that purchase
and administer infliximab) as well as the prescribing decisions of
physicians affiliatedtherewith. Given the widespread gaps in
Inflectra's insurance coverage--engineered by J&J--providers have
overwhelmingly chosen to stock only Remicade (which is essentially
universally covered given its long tenure and dominant position) rather
than deal with the risk of possible denials of coverage for Inflectra.
Thus, providers have declined to purchase Inflectra across the board,
even for patients covered by insurance plans that do cover the product.
To take one example, even though Inflectra is covered by Medicare and
other government programs, providers have been unwilling to stock
Inflectra even for potential use with such government-insured patients.
As a result, not only is the federal government forced to continue
reimbursing for Remicade, the more expensive product, but the effective
foreclosure of biosimilars is expanded well beyond the 70 percent of
commercially insured patients directly foreclosed by J&J's insurer
contracts. Indeed, as of September 1, 2017, about 90 percent of
healthcare provider accounts using infliximab had purchased no
Inflectra at all. J&J has stoked providers' reluctance to purchase
Inflectra by touting with providers the very lack of coverage for
Inflectra created by J&J's own exclusionary contracts.
11. Exclusionary rebates and bundling arrangements with healthcare
providers. Beyond the spillover impact described above, J&J has also
extended its practices of multi-product bundling and bundling of
contestable and incontestable demand in contracts with healthcare
providers.
12. J&J's exclusionary plan has been remarkably effective at
stifling competition: Today, almost no national commercial health
insurer provides coverage for Inflectra (except under the spurious
``fail first'' scenario), and the vast bulk of healthcare provider
accounts using infliximab (approximately 90 percent) have not purchased
Inflectra at all. Despite some coverage by regional and government
plans, Inflectra has secured less than 4 percent of total infliximab
unit sales in the U.S. as of September 1, 2017.
13. The harm to Pfizer and to competition as a whole--and,
ultimately, to consumers, businesses, and the U.S. government, who bear
the brunt of rising healthcare costs nationwide--is manifest. In
response to a new entrant offering lower prices for a product deemed to
have ``no clinically meaningful differences'' from the incumbent's
brand, basic economics would predict that market-wide prices would
fall. Instead, the opposite has occurred. Since the time the FDA
approved Inflectra and J&J implemented its publicly-stated plan to
block biosimilars like Inflectra, J&J has raised the list price of
Remicade by close to 9 percent and increased the amount the U.S.
government reimburses for Remicade by more than $190 per infused dose.
J&J's list price increases are not overcome by increased rebates and
discounts: Remicade's ``average selling price'' (``ASP'')--which by
federal law is an average of a drug's pricing after taking into account
discounts, rebates, and other price concessions--actually has increased
since Inflectra's entry. As of September 2017, Remicade's ASP was more
than 10 percent higher than Inflectra's ASP. Pfizer has offered to
guarantee clients that Inflectra would be less expensive unit-for-unit
than Remicade during a contract term. Despite Inflectra's lower per-
unit prices, and J&J's escalating prices, Remicade has not lost any
substantial volume or share of sales to Inflectra, even though FDA
determined there to be no clinically meaningful differences between the
two products.
14. In July, J&J extolled the success of its scheme, noting that it
had not ``seen much of an impact'' from Inflectra's entrance, and that
J&J is ``especially well-
prepared to manage through the Remicade biosimilars.'' \3\ J&J also
said it was confident that it could fend off even subsequent biosimilar
entrants this year because of its exclusionary contracts: ``[W]e have
our contracting in place with all the managed care organizations [e.g.,
health insurers].'' \4\ The net result is that patients (along with
healthcare providers and the U.S. Government) have fewer choices and
pay more than they should.

15. Major stakeholders at every level of the healthcare marketplace
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
are suffering as a result of J&J's competition-reducing actions:

Most importantly, consumers suffer in the form of artificially
inflated prices (including higher coinsurance payments, insurance
premiums, and taxes), as well as reduced choice.

Government programs, including Medicare--and ultimately
taxpayers--suffer by having to pay artificially higher prices for the
vast majority of their infliximab utilization.

Pfizer, of course, suffers loss of sales, investment, and
reputation as a result of J&J's success in securing commitments to
disadvantage Inflectra.
16. Pfizer brings this action under the antitrust laws of the
United States to challenge J&J's anticompetitive conduct. If J&J's
conduct is allowed to continue, its ``Biosimilar Readiness Plan'' will
become the playbook for biologic originator firms seeking to preserve
their dominance in the face of biosimilar competition--thus subverting
the competition-enhancing objectives of the BPCIA.
17. Allegations relating to Pfizer's conduct are based on personal
knowledge; other allegations are based on Pfizer's research, publicly
available sources, feedback from customers, and information and belief.
THE PARTIES
18. Plaintiff Pfizer is a corporation organized and existing under
the laws of Delaware. Pfizer's principal place of business in the
United States is located at 235 East 42nd Street, New York, New York
10017. Pfizer is a research-based international pharmaceutical company
which researches, develops, manufactures, and sells pharmaceutical
products across the spectrum, from branded innovator products to
generics and over-the-counter medications. Pfizer is also committed to
developing biosimilar medications to bring competition, lower prices,
and choice to patients.
19. Pfizer has commercialized Inflectra, a biosimilar to J&J's
Remicade, through its partnership with Celltrion, the holder of the
drug product's Biologics License Application. The FDA approved
Inflectraas a biosimilar to Remicade on April 5, 2016.
20. Defendant Johnson & Johnson is a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of New Jersey. Johnson & Johnson's principal
place of business in the United States is located at One J&J Plaza, New
Brunswick, New Jersey 08933. Johnson & Johnson is an international
pharmaceutical company--one of the largest in the world--and was the
sole supplier of infliximab, marketed as Remicade, between 1998 and
2016, when Inflectra came to market.
21. Defendant Janssen Biotech, Inc. (``Janssen'') is a wholly owned
subsidiary of Johnson & Johnson. Janssen is a corporation organized and
existing under the laws of Pennsylvania. Janssen's corporate
headquarters are located at 800 Ridgeview Drive, Horsham, Pennsylvania
19044. Janssen co-owns or has licenses to the Remicade patents and
performs the marketing for Remicade in the United States.
JURISDICTION, VENUE, AND INTERSTATE COMMERCE
22. This action arises under the antitrust laws of the United
States, including Section 1 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1,
Section 2 of the Sherman Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2, Section 3 of the
Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 14, and Sections 4 and 16 of the Clayton
Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 15 and 26.
23. Subject matter jurisdiction is founded on 28 U.S.C.
Sec. Sec. 1331 and 1337(a).
24. Johnson & Johnson may be found, transacts business, and is
subject to personal jurisdiction in this judicial district.
25. Janssen maybe found, transacts business, and is subject to
personal jurisdiction in this judicial district.
26. The violations of law alleged in this Complaint took place, in
part, in this judicial district and have injured Pfizer in this
district. Venue is therefore appropriate in the Eastern District of
Pennsylvania under Section 12 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 22,
and under 28 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1391(b) and (c).
27. The creation, marketing, sale, and distribution of Remicade and
Inflectra, and the actions complained of in this Complaint, occur in
and substantially affect interstate commerce.
FACTUAL AND REGULATORY BACKGROUND
A. Biologics
28. Biologics are treatments derived from living systems such as
microorganisms or plant or animal cells. As the FDA explains:
``Biological products include a wide range of products such as
vaccines, blood and blood components, allergenics, somatic cells, gene
therapy, tissues, and recombinant therapeutic proteins. Biologics can
be composed of sugars, proteins, or nucleic acids or complex
combinations of these substances, or maybe living entities such as
cells and tissues. Biologics are isolated from a variety of natural
sources--human, animal, or microorganism--and may be produced by
biotechnology methods and other cutting-edge technologies. Gene-based
and cellular biologics, for example, often are at the forefront of
biomedical research, and may be used to treat a variety of medical
conditions for which no other treatments are available.'' \5\ In
contrast to most drugs, which are chemically synthesized and whose
structure is known, most biologics are complex mixtures that are not
easily identified or characterized.\6\

Congress Enacts the Biologics Price Competition and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Innovation Act to Spur Price Competition for Biologic Medications
29. Congress has made clear that competition in pharmaceuticals is
to be encouraged, and, to that end, in 1984 enacted the Hatch-Waxman
Act (``Hatch-Waxman''), which established an abbreviated pathway for
approval of generic counterparts to non-biologic branded drug products.
Before Hatch-Waxman, a generic applicant had to conduct the same kinds
of safety and efficacy studies (including large clinical trials and the
like) as the originating drug manufacturer. Such a process, which can
cost hundreds of millions of dollars and take years to complete, was
prohibitive for would-be generic entrants and led to the near absence
of generic competition to branded drug products. Hatch-Waxman
eliminated this hurdle; it allowed generic firms to rely upon the
originator's safety and efficacy studies. Generic applicants need only
show that their products use the same active pharmaceutical ingredient
as the originator, and that their products are bioequivalent (e.g.,
that the generic product's uptake into the body is equivalent to the
branded drug). A principal goal of Hatch-Waxman was to trigger price
competition with originator products, many of which had enjoyed
longstanding exclusivity. That goal has been achieved: According to the
FDA, the competition spurred by Hatch-Waxman has saved more than $1.6
trillion for patients and the healthcare system.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ See Kathleen ``Cook'' Uhl, 2016: A Record-Setting Year for
Generic Drugs, U.S. Food & Drug Administration (Feb. 24, 2017),
available at https://blogs.fda.gov/fdavoice/index.php/2017/02/2016-a-
record-setting-year-for-generic-drugs/ (noting that ``2016 was a
record-setting year for FDA's generic drug program,'' and that ``[o]ver
the last 10 years, generic drugs have saved the U.S. healthcare system
about $1.68 trillion'').
30. However, for a number of reasons, biologic products generally
are not covered by the Hatch-Waxman procedures. Nevertheless, given the
success of Hatch-
Waxman in spurring competition for non-biologic medicines, Congress and
nearly all stakeholders in the healthcare system have recognized the
great desirability of having an analogous system for biologics.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ See U.S. Food & Drug Administration, Implementation of the
Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (Feb. 12, 2016),
available at https://www.fda.gov/drugs/
guidancecomplianceregulatoryinformation/ucm215089.htm (``The goal of
the BPCI Act is similar, in concept, to that of the Drug Price
Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (a.k.a. the `Hatch-
Waxman Act') which created abbreviated pathways for the approval of
drug products under Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFD&C
Act).'').
31. In 2009, Congress addressed the need for competition in the
biologics marketplace by introducing the BPCIA, which was signed into
law in 2010. The Act furthers the ``FDA's longstanding policy of
permitting appropriate reliance on what is already known about a drug,
thereby saving time and resources and avoiding unnecessary duplication
of . . . testing.'' \9\

Biologics Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, https://www.fda.gov/
Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/ucm215089.htm (last
visited Sept. 18, 2017).
32. A principal purpose of the Act--as reflected in its very name
(i.e., the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act)--was to spur
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
price competition in biologic drug products:

``We have to find a way to introduce competition into [the
biosimilar] market,'' including balancing ``giving incentives
for development of new products but bringing about the benefits
of competition in the marketplace.'' (Hon. Henry Waxman, United
States Representative from California)

``Legislation to facilitate the development of biosimilars
should promote competition and lower prices[.]'' (Hon. Anna G.
Eshoo, United States Representative from California)

``We want to foster a robust biosimilar market.'' (Hon. Joe
Barton, United States Representative from Texas)

``[C]ompetition [from biosimilars] is good for patient
safety, consumer choice, and drive[s] savings for consumers and
the healthcare system at large.'' (Hon. Gene Green, United
States Representative from Texas)
33. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated regulatory approval pathway
for the introduction of biosimilars. A biosimilar applicant may rely on
the clinical studies of the reference listed drug if it can show: (a)
that the proposed biosimilar is ``highly similar to the [originator
product, or RLD] notwithstanding minor differences in clinically
inactive components''; and (b) that ``there are no clinically
meaningful differences between the [proposed biosimilar] and the [RLD]
in terms of safety, purity, and potency'' (42 U.S.C. Sec. 262(i)(2)).
34. Although biosimilars have no clinically meaningful differences
in safety, purity, and potency from the RLD, they are not automatically
substitutable with the RLD (unlike Hatch-Waxman generics). Thus, if a
doctor prescribes the RLD, a pharmacist cannot substitute a biosimilar
unless that product has been designated as interchangeable by FDA and
the relevant state law permits substitution of interchangeable
biologics.\10\ This allows originator firms to retain the bulk of their
existing patient bases, which typically is not possible for a branded
firm to do when a Hatch-Waxman generic enters (because state
substitution laws permit prescriptions for the brand to be
automatically substituted with the Hatch-Waxman generic by the
pharmacist without the need for physician intervention). This
difference enables biologic originator firms to leverage their
monopolies over existing patients to extract anticompetitive
commitments from insurers and providers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\10\ The BPCIA does provide for an ``interchangeable'' designation,
but FDA published draft guidelines for establishing interchangeability
only this year. U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Considerations in
Demonstrating Interchangeability With a Reference Product (Draft
Guidance) (Jan. 17, 2017). And while Pfizer believes that Inflectra can
be safely and effectively substituted for Remicade (indeed, studies
have shown that switching patients can be done safely and effectively,
and Pfizer has supported and/or taken part in some of these studies),
it will be years before Inflectra or any other biologic receives a
formal ``interchangeability'' designation from FDA in the United
States. Nonetheless, neither the BPCIA nor FDA contemplates that
biosimilars should be prevented from competing in themarketplace--i.e.,
that consumers should be denied access to them--until they are
designated interchangeable.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
C. Infliximab
35. Infliximab is a tumor necrosis factor (``TNF'')-inhibiting
biologic drug used to treat a range of immune-mediated diseases,
including Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, rheumatoid arthritis,
psoriatic arthritis, ankylosingspondylitis, and plaque psoriasis.
36. As a biologic, infliximab is not synthesized in a laboratory,
but rather derived from a living organism. Infliximab is a chimeric
IgG1k monoclonal antibody (composed of human constant and murine
variable regions) specific for human tumor necrosis factor-alpha.
Infliximab is produced by a recombinant cell line cultured by
continuous perfusion and is purified by a series of steps that includes
measures to inactivate and remove viruses.
37. Infliximab is an infusion therapy, meaning it is administered
intravenously. Thus, infliximab patients must (in most cases) visit
clinics, hospitals, or other medical facilities to receive the therapy
from healthcare professionals. As a result, patients rarely purchase
infliximab themselves at retail pharmacies. Instead, infusion centers,
clinics, and hospitals purchase infliximab, and after administration,
seek reimbursement from the patient's insurer or a government payer
(e.g., Medicare). Infliximab is an important medicine that has provided
life-changing benefits to millions of patients.
D. J&J's Remicade
38. J&J introduced the first infliximab product in the United
States in 1998, under the brand name Remicade.
39. Remicade is widely used: An estimated 475,000 patients in the
U.S. receive at least one dose of Remicade annually. This fact,
combined with the cost (approximately $4,000 per infused dose at list
price), makes administering Remicade a major expense item for insurers
and healthcare providers.
40. J&J's list price increases for Remicade and other pricing
actions have resulted in consistent increases in Remicade's ASP. J&J
has increased the price of Remicade without experiencing a loss of
sales to other therapies. Instead, Remicade sales have increased
steadily since it was introduced. Indeed, J&J has been able to continue
raising the price of Remicade notwithstanding the arrival of Inflectra.
41. Since 1998, J&J has made billions of dollars in profit on
Remicade.
E. Pfizer's Inflectra
42. Beginning in 2008, Celltrion undertook to develop a biosimilar
to Remicade and move it through the intensive FDA review process. The
Biologics License Application for Inflectra was filed with FDA in 2014.
After rigorous scientific review, FDA approved infliximab-dyybon April
5, 2016. In the FDA news release announcing its approval of Inflectra,
the director of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research
reiterated that approval as a biosimilar reflects a determination of
``no clinically meaningful differences'' from the originator, and
stated that ``[p]atients and the health care community can be confident
that biosimilar products are high quality and meet the agency's
rigorous scientific standards.'' \11\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\11\ See U.S. Food and Drug Administration, FDA Approves Inflectra,
A Biosimilar to Remicade (Apr. 5, 2016), https://www.fda.gov/
newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm494227.
htm.
43. J&J claimed patent protection over Remicade--as noted, making
it the sole provider of infliximab for nearly two decades--and thus
Pfizer and Celltrion were forced to defend against J&J's patent suit in
parallel with FDA's regulatory review of the Inflectra application. On
August 17, 2016, J&J's patent covering the infliximab antibody was
ruled invalid by the United States District Court for the District of
Massachusetts, a ruling which confirmed that J&J had no valid right to
exclude Pfizer (or other potential biosimilar entrants). The Court held
that the antibodies covered by J&J's Remicade patent had been disclosed
and claimed in an earlier patent.\12\ Just a few months after the
district court ruling, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office issued a
final decision in a re-examination of the same patent, holding that the
patent was invalid.\13\

\13\ Id.
44. After overcoming these hurdles, and after a 180-day notice
period required by the BPCIA, Pfizer began selling Inflectra in
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
November 2016.
45. Inflectra is approved for all the same indications as Remicade,
except pediatric ulcerative colitis, as to which J&J continues to enjoy
an FDA-granted period of exclusivity because of the indication's status
as an ``orphan'' indication (established on proof that the number of
people affected by the disease or condition for which the drug is to be
developed is fewer than 200,000 persons), which is scheduled to end in
2018. On that date, Inflectra will be eligible to seek approval for
pediatric ulcerative colitis. In any event, this indication accounted
for less than 5 percent of overall infliximab utilization in 2016.
46. Pfizer introduced Inflectra with a list price 15 percent lower
than Remicade's, and, in negotiations with insurers and providers,
offered substantial additional pricing concessions in the form of
discounts and/or rebates that in some instances were more than 40
percent below Inflectra's list price. The goal and effect was to offer
Inflectra for less than J&J was offering Remicade; indeed, for many
customers, Pfizer committed to ensure that Inflectra would have a lower
net per-unit price than Remicade.
47. Given that it was charging a lower price for Inflectra than J&J
was charging for Remicade, Pfizer was optimistic that it would have an
opportunity to compete, to secure a reasonable share of the business,
particularly for new patients, and to bring the benefits of price
competition to consumers, providers, insurers, and the U.S. government.
However, due to J&J's exclusionary conduct, competition has been
foreclosed. J&J maintains its monopoly and has continued to capture
over 96 percent of infliximab sales even while maintaining prices far
above competitive levels.
F.
The Importance of Insurance Coverage for Infliximab
48. Most patients who are prescribed Remicade have some form of
insurance coverage or qualify for patient assistance. The sources of
insurance coverage are (a) private insurance, accounting for about 60
percent of patients nationally, and (b) government insurance programs
(principally Medicare and Medicaid), accounting for the remaining 40
percent. Insurance coverage and reimbursement are therefore key to the
adoption of the product by patients and healthcare providers alike. If
a product as expensive as Remicade is not widely reimbursed, it will
not be significantly utilized.
49. Because Remicade is not dispensed in a retail pharmacy but
rather administered intravenously in a clinic or other institutional
setting, it generally is not included under the ``pharmacy benefit'' of
most health plans. In the pharmacy benefit setting, physicians
prescribe a drug and the patient procures the medication him or herself
at the pharmacy, paying for it with a combination of insurance coverage
(either private or government-sponsored) and out-of-pocket payment
(usually, a co-pay). In the pharmacy benefit context, neither the
prescribing physician nor the institution with which the physician is
affiliated bears financial risk with respect to the drug selected,
i.e., the drug is not purchased and stocked in advance by providers at
their own cost. The pharmacy buys the drug, dispenses it, and is
reimbursed.
50. In contrast, ``medical benefit'' products such as Remicade are
administered at a clinic or other healthcare provider site, and the
provider itself first purchases the drug product for use in the
infusion treatment of patients, and then later seeks reimbursement for
the drug from a third party payer (a practice commonly referred to as
``buy and bill''). When a treatment is administered, the provider must
secure payment for the service, including the cost of the product
dispensed (which the provider had to pay up front with its own funds).
In this context, the provider has a strong interest in utilizing drugs
that are widely covered by insurance, particularly by the major
national commercial health insurers and significant regional insurers
active in its area. If a drug product is not widely covered, such that
there is a risk that coverage might be denied, and providers thus would
be burdened with a potential financial loss for what they paid for the
product, providers are much less likely to purchase that product--a
response that is in line with the providers' economic interests (to be
reimbursed).
51. Many of the facilities administering infusion services of the
type at issue here are physician-owned. Thus, the physicians themselves
have both prescribing authority and a strong financial incentive to
avoid products that are not widely covered.
52. Commercial insurers typically publish medical policies
enumerating the drug products they will cover under the medical benefit
and the terms under which they will do so. For example, medical
policies may exclude drugs from coverage, or they may dictate
restrictions on use. Drug manufacturers compete, usually with rebates
or other price concessions, to obtain coverage under insurer medical
policies and to have either fewer restrictions on reimbursement than
their competitors--or, at a minimum, to achieve ``parity'' whereby the
competing products have the same restrictions on reimbursement and the
patient and/or doctor can choose between them. Securing at least parity
placement is critical, especially for new products seeking to gain
traction in the marketplace, and particularly with large insurers,
which have tens of millions of covered patients.
G. The Importance of Access at the Provider Level
53. As discussed above, providers (hospitals, clinics, etc.) are
the market actors that actually purchase infliximab for use with their
infusion services for patients. J&J's agreements and conduct have the
effect of foreclosing this essential source of distribution.
54. Providers do not want to risk being unable to secure
reimbursement for any drug used to treat a patient after having already
paid for the product. Because it can be costly to monitor coverage
status across myriad insurers and implement procedures to match product
use to a patient's coverage, gaps in reimbursement policies give ``buy
and bill'' provider accounts reasons to stock only products with
universal (or near-universal) coverage. Here, due to J&J's
anticompetitive contracts at the insurer level, J&J has succeeded in
preventing biosimilar competitors from achieving the same status.
J&J'S EXCLUSIONARY SCHEME
55. Not content with its nearly 2 full decades of exclusivity with
Remicade, and the billions of dollars of profits that such exclusivity
enabled, J&J hatched a multifaceted scheme to ensure that biosimilars
would never become viable competitors--a scheme embodied, at least in
part, in its ``Biosimilar Readiness Plan.'' J&J revealed the existence
of the plan, and at least some specifics thereof, during a recent
investor call and presentation.\14\ And a J&J consultant bragged at a
recent health conference that his firm helped design the plan to
realize J&J's goal of ensuring that biosimilars never gain a foothold.

56. J&J's conduct has not gone unnoticed in the industry. For
example, an analyst at a prominent securities firm (Bernstein Research)
recently summarized key aspects of J&J's scheme, observing that J&J
has: (a) ``negotiated with [insurers]'' and set up ``exclusive
contracts . . . in nearly half the market,'' thereby making providers
unwilling to purchase Inflectra; (b) ``offered up deeper discounts to
large independent infusion centers [i.e., major providers], which are
more economically sensitive''; and (c) ``bundled several drugs and
medical devices [together] for larger hospitals.'' \15\ The analyst
also noted that a key to J&J's strategy was the ``long `tail' of
[patients] remaining on the brand'' \16\--the incontestable demand--
which gives J&J leverage to extract commitments from insurers not to
cover Inflectra.\17\ Another industry observer, commenting on the
Bernstein survey, noted that J&J's ``fail first'' requirements with
insurers ``force hospitals and clinics to buy Remicade.'' The observer
also noted that:

While the Bernstein survey suggests that Pfizer has offered
only a `` `low single digit' discount off of the ASP'' of Inflectra,
that is not accurate. As set forth herein, Pfizer has offered Inflectra
at a significantdiscount (to list price as well as ASP), but continues
to be foreclosed by J&J's anticompetitive contracts. J&J, meanwhile,
has raised the price of Remicade since Inflectra's entry. The Bernstein
survey also speculates that with the entry of a third biosimilar in
mid-2019, ``we would likely [sic] see one of the biosimilars crossing
the Rubicon and offering the required discounts.'' Gal, supra note 15,
at 1. However, as set forth herein, J&J's exclusive contracts and
bundling practices foreclose all new biosimilar entrants, including
Pfizer, from competing with Remicade on price and, if not stopped, will
allow J&J to continue to maintain the monopoly power it currently
exercises with Remicade.
J&J has had yet another advantage--an ability and willingness
to bundle different medicines as part of a package deal. By
offering discounts and rebates for several drugs, J&J can
secure contracts and crowd out rivals. And discounts are also
appealing to physicians who run their own infusion centers.\18\

57. J&J's scheme is set forth in more detail below:
A.
J&J Bars Access to Insurer Reimbursement Through Improper
Exclusive Contracts and Anticompetitive Bundling Practices
1.
J&J's Exclusive Contracts with Health Insurers
58. A centerpiece of J&J's strategy to block competition from
biosimilars has been to secure contractual commitments from commercial
insurance companies to exclude biosimilars from coverage under their
plans, making Remicade the exclusive infliximab available to patients
covered by those plans. Such contractual commitments have taken various
forms. Some insurers have entered into contracts with J&J that required
them simply to exclude biosimilars from their medical policies and/or
drug formularies altogether. Other J&J contracts have imposed a
spurious requirement that the biosimilar could be reimbursed only after
a patient first tried and failed on Remicade (the ``fail first''
requirement), which virtually ensures that the biosimilar will never be
prescribed and never be reimbursed. If a patient fails on Remicade, it
would defy sound medical judgment for a physician to switch to the
therapeutically equivalent biosimilar, which works in exactly the same
way, rather than another therapy, to which a patient may potentially
respond differently.\19\ Regardless of their specific form, these
contracts all had the same effect--to exclude biosimilars from coverage
and (as one analyst recently confirmed) grant an ``exclusive'' to
Remicade.\20\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\19\ The notion that attempting treatment with a biosimilar after
its reference listed drug has first failed would defy medical judgment
recently has been reinforced in the European League Against Rheumatism
rheumatoid arthritis management recommendations. In those
recommendations, ``[t]he Task Force reiterated its position that if a
TNF-inhibitor fails, another TNF-inhibitor--but not a biosimilar of the
same molecule!--can be as effective as changing the mode of action.''

59. J&J has induced most major health insurers, covering at least
70 percent of commercially insured patients in the United States, to
adopt these improper contractual exclusivity restrictions and to impose
outright bans on Inflectra's coverage or so-called ``fail first''
requirements. These insurers include (in decreasing order of patients
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
covered):
National insurers:
(a)
UnitedHealthcare: UnitedHealthcare adopted the ``fail first''
requirement. United Healthcare has approximately 30.6 million covered
commercial medical patients across all 50 states.
(b)
Anthem: Anthem excluded Inflectra from coverage altogether.
Anthem has approximately 30.4 million covered commercial medical
patients concentrated in 14 states.
(c)
Aetna: Aetna adopted a complex set of indication specific
conditions which operate in practice as ``fail first'' requirements.
Aetna has approximately 17.9 million covered commercial medical
patients in all or nearly all states and territories in the United
States.
(d)
Cigna: Cigna adopted the ``fail first'' requirement. Cigna has
approximately 13 million covered commercial medical patients across all
50 states.
Regional insurers:
(a)
HealthNet (Centene): HealthNet adopted a complex set of
indication specific conditions which operate in practice as ``fail
first'' requirements. HealthNet (as part of its acquisition by Centene)
has approximately 12 million covered commercial medical patients
concentrated in 28 states.
(b)
CareFirst/Blue Cross Blue Shield: CareFirst adopted the ``fail
first'' requirement. Indeed, CareFirst agreed with J&J that Inflectra
would be non-preferred, meaning it cannot be reimbursed unless there
are ``clinical circumstances that would exclude the use of . . .
preferred products,'' including Remicade. CareFirst has approximately
3.2 million covered commercial medical patients principally found in
Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia.
(c)
Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina: BCBS of North
Carolina adopted the ``fail first'' requirement. BCBS of North Carolina
has approximately 2.7 million covered commercial medical patients
concentrated in North Carolina.
(d)
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Tennessee: BCBS of Tennessee adopted
the ``fail first'' requirement. BCBS of Tennessee has approximately 1.6
million covered commercial medical patients concentrated in Tennessee.
(e)
Blue Cross Blue Shield of Louisiana: BCBS of Louisiana adopted
the ``fail first'' requirement. BCBS of Louisiana has approximately 1.6
million covered commercial medical patients principally concentrated in
Louisiana.
(f)
Excellus Blue Cross Blue Shield: Excellus BCBS adopted the
``fail first'' requirement. Excellus has approximately 1.2 million
covered commercial medical patients concentrated in New York.
(g)
Independence Blue Cross: Independence Blue Cross adopted the
``fail first'' requirement. Independence Blue Cross is the leading
health insurer in Philadelphia.
These contracts alone affect approximately 114 million covered
commercial medical patients of the over approximately 214 million
patients covered by commercial medical insurance in the United States.
Pfizer has reason to believe there are more.
60. While exclusive contracts can--in certain circumstances--be
perfectly appropriate, the exclusivity provisions described in
Paragraphs 8, 9, and 58 serve no legitimate or procompetitive purpose
and were not earned through simple price competition. After Inflectra's
FDA approval in April 2016, and before J&J implemented its exclusionary
contracts, health insurers undertook reviews to determine whether there
was a medical reason not to reimburse Inflectra or to disfavor it
relative to other therapies. Following these reviews, several major
health insurance companies--including at least Aetna, Anthem, and
UnitedHealthcare-- classified Inflectra at parity with Remicade. This
confirmed that there was no medical reason justifying a restrictive
reimbursement policy toward Inflectra. It also meant that, for the time
being, Inflectra would be reimbursed without restriction. As a result,
the stage was set for Inflectra to begin competing head-to-head with
Remicade on a level playing field--and for patients to begin receiving
the benefits of greater choice and lower prices.
61. But this initial state of affairs was short lived. As a result
of J&J's anticompetitive conduct, insurers began to reverse course and
restrict coverage of Inflectra.
62. For example, in October 2016, UnitedHealthcare, the nation's
largest health insurer, with over 30 million covered commercial medical
patients, published an update to its medical and site of care policies
classifying Inflectra at parity with Remicade for the approved
indications (with an effective date of November 1, 2016). This meant
that, for UnitedHealthcare, Inflectra would be reimbursed freely and
would not be disfavored relative to Remicade. Just weeks later,
however, UnitedHealthcare reversed course. UnitedHealthcare classified
Remicade as its ``preferred'' product, and instructed that Inflectra
would be eligible for reimbursement only in circumstances so limited as
to be practically non-existent. Under UnitedHealthcare's new policy,
Inflectra could be reimbursed only where the following conditions are
met: (a) the patient must show a minimal clinical response, or an
intolerance or adverse reaction, to Remicade; (b) the physician must
attest that Inflectra would not lead to the same adverse responses; and
(c) the patient must show no loss of favorable response in established
maintenance therapy with Remicade, and must not have developed
neutralizing antibodies to any infliximab biosimilar product that has
made the therapy less effective. As a practical matter, this meant that
Inflectra would not be reimbursed for UnitedHealthcare's more than 30
million commercial medical members, and that Remicade would be the
exclusive infliximab with UnitedHealthcare--despite the lack of any
medical basis for denying those members access to a lower-priced
alternative to Remicade.
63. UnitedHealthcare's reversal, of course, did not happen by
chance. J&J induced UnitedHealthcare to enter into an exclusive deal by
threatening to penalize UnitedHealthcare with the loss of significant
rebates unless UnitedHealthcare agreed to deny coverage of Inflectra.
64. J&J has employed the same approach to secure exclusive deals
with most or all of the major insurers identified above. In most cases
these coercive biosimilar-exclusion contracts were the only
economically viable option for insurers--as adopting any alternative
would require the insurer to incur a substantial penalty (i.e.,
foregone rebates to existing Remicade patients) that could not be
offset by the per-unit cost savings available on the number of patients
likely to use the biosimilar, at least in the near term.
2. J&J's Bundling Tactics with Health Insurers
65. J&J's threatened penalties are effective because they leverage
the large base of existing patients already stabilized on Remicade.
Given that J&J has offered the only infliximab option in the United
States for nearly two decades, its base of existing Remicade patients
is substantial, amounting to hundreds of thousands of patients across
the country. And, in part driven by J&J's marketing efforts to secure
this outcome, existing Remicade patients are likely to stay on
Remicade. Thus, the demand for Remicade associated with this existing
base of patients is, as a practical and economic matter, incontestable.
This is so despite the fact that switching is within the scope of FDA's
approval for use of biosimilars and thus appropriate when medically
directed--something Pfizer discusses with clients. The situation is
different for new patients who may be candidates for infliximab. In
light of this, Pfizer has focused, among other things, on competing for
a substantial share of new patient starts (the ``contestable'' demand)
by pricing Inflectra competitively with both insurers and providers on
a unit-for-unit basis. The fact that Inflectra's ASP is lower than
Remicade's underscores the cost savings it offers.
66. By threatening to withhold attractive rebates on all Remicade
prescriptions-- including those for existing patients as well as new
ones--unless an insurer agrees to exclusivity, J&J is able to leverage
the incontestable demand for Remicade to exclude competition for the
contestable demand, i.e., it bundles the contestable and incontestable
demand. Even if Pfizer offers a significantly lower price for Inflectra
unit-for-unit, as it has done, insurers will agree to J&J's exclusive
deals to avoid losing rebates on the substantial base of existing
Remicade patients who are not likely to switch to Inflectra despite the
presence of the lower-priced biosimilar. A recent article by two Yale
Medical School professors in the Journal of the American Medical
Association illustrates how the kind of leverage J&J has over existing,
stable Remicade patients allows it to extract commitments to exclude
the biosimilar:
If a biosimilar manufacturer intends to upend the preferred
position of the brand by offering a substantial price discount
to the [insurer], the branded manufacturer can respond by
withdrawing the rebate on the [branded] biologic, creating a
``rebate trap.'' For any patient continuing the [branded]
biologic, a payer's cost for that patient will double once the
rebate is withdrawn. . . . Even in [an] optimistic scenario, in
which the price of the biosimilar is 60 percent less than the
price of the brand after rebates and discounts, if the payer is
only able to convert 50 percent of its patient users to the
biosimilar [because existing patients will tend to stay on the
original branded product], the rebate trap ensures that payer
total costs actually increase relative to costs prior to
biosimilar availability.
*
*
*
To avoid the rebate trap, any strategy to reduce spending on
biologics through adoption of biosimilars requires a near-
complete switch of patient users from the branded biologic to
the biosimilar. However, for many chronic diseases, the
proportion of patients new to a given biological therapy is
less than 20 percent of the total patients taking that drug in
a given year. The remainder represents a stable base of
patients whose disease is well-maintained while they are using
current therapy and thus are unlikely to switch [to the
biosimilar].\21\

Biosimilars for Chronic Diseases,'' Journal of the American Medical
Association (May 1, 2017), available at http://jamanetwork.com/
journals/jama/article-abstract/2625049 (emphasis added).
67. J&J has further insulated its contracts with insurers from
competition by bundling rebates for Remicade with rebates on other
products in return for commitments not to cover Inflectra. J&J made it
no secret that it would leverage other products as part of its
``Biosimilar Readiness Plan.'' As J&J's Worldwide Chair for
Pharmaceuticals made clear on a recent earnings call, ``We are fully
prepared to execute our focused biosimilar readiness plan,'' including
``developing innovative contracts . . . [to] utilize the full breadth
of our portfolio.'' \22\ The ``full breadth of [J&J's] portfolio''
includes several drugs for which Pfizer does not offer any directly
competing alternative. These include drugs such as Simponi (used for
rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosingspondylitis, and
ulcerative colitis), Simponi Aria (used for rheumatoid arthritis), and
Stelara (used for plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and Crohn's
disease). These products are widely used, with Simponi/Simponi Aria
generating for J&J approximately $1.7 billion in 2016 and Stelara
generating for J&J approximately $3.2 billion in 2016. J&J has
threatened insurers with the loss of rebates on these other drugs, as
well as Remicade, if they do not agree to exclude Inflectra from
coverage.

68. J&J's multi-product bundling, along with its bundling of
contestable demand (i.e., new patients) and incontestable demand (i.e.,
existing Remicade patients), have amplified the anticompetitive effects
of J&J's exclusive contracts, and made the exclusivity provided by
those contracts even more durable. Insurers have made it clear to
Pfizer that its net cost for Inflectra would need to be low enough to
offset the loss of J&J rebates. But, because of the combined effect of
these bundles, Pfizer cannot offset the financial penalties that J&J
threatens to impose on insurers who do not agree to exclusivity. As a
result, Pfizer is economically prohibited from competing for coverage
by the major insurers--even when their exclusive contracts with J&J
expire. J&J can use the same bundling strategies to ensure continuation
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
of the exclusionary pattern.
B.
J&J's Improper Insurer-Level Contracts Deter Hospitals
and Clinics from Purchasing Inflectra, Thus Amplifying Foreclosure
69. Providers are unwilling to stock a drug product where there is
significant uncertainty about whether it will be reimbursed by health
insurers; because they administer infliximab onsite, providers must
expend funds for the product in the first instance, then seek
reimbursement after providing treatment. The provider has theoretical
recourse against the patient where coverage is denied, but the prospect
of securing payment in full from the patient is bleak, especially for
drugs as costly as Remicade. As a result, where a significant portion
of a provider's patients are insured by plans that have agreed to
exclude Inflectra--pursuant to the types of contracts described above--
the provider is unlikely to offer Inflectra for any of its patients, to
avoid being caught with no reimbursement.
70. As a recent article in Bloomberg stated:
Ascension Health, a nearly 23,000-bed nonprofit hospital system
based in St. Louis, spends $55 million a year on Remicade, more
than any other drug. Using Inflectra, part of a new class of
medicines called biosimilars, would save it at least $10
million annually, according to Ascension's chief pharmacist,
Roy Guharoy. He met with Pfizer and planned to integrate
Inflectra into care more often until learning that insurers
preferred to stay with Remicade. ``This we did not expect,''
Guharoy said. ``If the insurance companies force us to use the
branded product, of course our hands are tied.'' \23\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\23\ Jared S. Hopkins, What's Harder Than Making Copycat Biotech
Drugs? Selling Them, Bloomberg (Aug. 15, 2017).
In short, provider purchases are driven by the coverage stated by
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
commercial insurers.
71. Having created reimbursement concerns through its exclusionary
contracts with health insurers, J&J touts the excluded status of
Inflectra in its marketing communications, knowing that doing so will
discourage providers from stocking the new biosimilar. As this brochure
shows, J&J markets the ``fail first'' requirement as a selling point
despite the fact that such a provision is medically inappropriate and
despite FDA's determination that there are no clinically meaningful
differences between the two products. Thus the brochure touts that
Remicade is ``Preferred Over Inflectra . . . Inflectra requires trial
and failure on Remicade prior to [Inflectra] utilization.''
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
72. Given the widespread gaps in Inflectra's insurance coverage--
caused by J&J--providers using infliximab have overwhelmingly chosen to
stock only Remicade (which is essentially universally covered given its
long tenure and dominant position) rather than deal with the risk of
possible denials of coverage for Inflectra. Thus, providers have
declined to purchase Inflectra across the board, even for patients
covered by commercial or government insurance plans that do cover the
product. The effective foreclosure of biosimilars thereby is expanded
well beyond the 70 percent of commercially insured patients directly
foreclosed by J&J's insurer contracts. Indeed, as of September 1, 2017,
about 90 percent of healthcare provider accounts using infliximab had
purchased no Inflectra at all.
C.
J&J Has Further Barred Access Through Exclusionary
Contracts with Providers
73. To further amplify Inflectra's foreclosure--even beyond the
population of patients covered by insurance plans that have agreed to
J&J's exclusivity terms, and the spillover effect on providers
discussed above--J&J has imposed exclusionary contracts on providers
themselves (e.g., clinics, hospitals, etc.).
74. After Inflectra's introduction, J&J began offering certain
large providers additional rebates and/or discounts on Remicade, but
only if the provider committed to buy Remicade for nearly all of its
infliximab needs. To be eligible for rebates, J&J required providers to
maintain purchase levels for Remicade at very close to the levels of
the year before Inflectra's launch--when Remicade was the only
infliximab option. With about 30 percent of prescriptions in any year
representing new patients (and a certain percentage of existing
patients exiting therapy each year), this condition also requires
providers to use Remicade for new patients if they wish to secure
payment from J&J, thus bundling contestable and incontestable demand
for Remicade. Like its insurer-level contracts, these contracts as a
practical matter make Remicade the exclusive infliximab with the
participating providers.
75. J&J has also used multi-product bundling in its provider-level
contracts. As one analyst reported, ``J&J bundled several drugs and
medical devices for larger hospitals, making Inflectra less
economical.'' \24\ Conditioning rebates linked to other J&J products
upon a promise not to do business with Inflectra only exacerbates the
exclusionary nature of J&J's contracts.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\24\ Gal, supra note 15, at 1.
76. Pfizer was and is prepared to negotiate with providers to make
Inflectra the lower-priced infliximab option on a per-unit basis, and
has even offered to guarantee that Inflectra would be less expensive
unit-for-unit than Remicade. But as with insurer contracts, to secure
the right to deal freely as to Inflectra (i.e., principally as to new
patients), the providers would lose significant J&J rebates on their
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
existing Remicade patient bases.
77. For Pfizer to make up the J&J rebates/discounts that insurers
and providers would lose on their existing Remicade patients, Pfizer
would have to price Inflectra below its own average variable cost. This
is because the lost J&J rebates/discounts are based on the much larger
base of existing Remicade patients, whereas Pfizer would be serving a
much smaller group of new patients, at least in the near term.
78. When the total amount of discounts and rebates that J&J offers
to insurers and providers under the contracts described herein,
including multi-product bundle contracts, is attributed to the portion
of Remicade sales that is contestable by a biosimilar like Inflectra,
J&J is pricing Remicade below its own average variable cost. As a
result, biosimilar competition to Remicade is foreclosed.
79. The combined effect of J&J's multifaceted exclusionary scheme
has been to foreclose Inflectra from approximately 90 percent of the
provider account distribution channel essential to connecting Inflectra
with patients of any kind.
J&J HAS MONOPOLY POWER IN THE RELEVANT MARKETS
80. Monopoly power is the ability of a single seller to raise
prices above the competitive price level without losing significant
business.
81. For years before Inflectra's entry, J&J's ASP for Remicade
increased, yet Remicade did not lose business. Between 2007 and 2017,
Remicade's ASP increased more than 62 percent. Despite Remicade's price
hikes, unit sales of Remicade have actually grown 15 percent during the
period from 2012 to 2016.
82. Inflectra's introduction has done nothing to erode Remicade's
monopoly power: Since Inflectra was launched, Remicade's ASP has
continued to increase without impacting Remicade's market position. Ten
months after Inflectra was introduced, Remicade still accounts for over
96 percent of all infliximab sales. Indeed, J&J has confirmed that
``biosimilar competition'' has had ``very little impact'' on
Remicade.\25\

83. As noted, infliximab is an infusion-administered TNF-inhibiting
immunosuppressant with FDA approved indications for rheumatoid
arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, ulcerative
colitis, Crohn's disease, and plaque psoriasis (together, the
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
``Relevant Indications'').
84. The broadest appropriate relevant product market is infusion-
administered drugs whose approved labeling from the FDA (a) encompasses
one or more of the Relevant Indications, and (b) is without restriction
for the applicable Relevant Indication, that is to say, the labeling
does not specify that the drug may be used for the applicable Relevant
Indication only after the patient has not responded to another therapy
(the ``Relevant Product Market'').\26\ Remicade enjoys a share of over
60 percent in the Relevant Product Market, nearly the same share it had
before Inflectra entered.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\26\ For example, the FDA approved Rituxan for the treatment of
moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis in adults only after
treatment with at least one other TNF antagonist has been used and did
not work well enough.

Relevant Indications. None of those drugs, however, is a reasonable
substitute for the infusion-
administered products. None significantly constrains the prices J&J is
able to charge for Remicade.
87. The non-infusion products approved for the Relevant Indications
include oral medications (e.g., Xeljanz) and self-injectables (e.g.,
Humira, Enbrel). These products are patient-administered. Infusion
drugs, by contrast, must be delivered by healthcare professionals in a
clinical setting (e.g., hospitals or infusion centers) during infusion
sessions that take upwards of two hours.
88. Physicians are not likely to switch from prescribing their
patients infliximab to prescribing those non-infusion products in
response to a small but significant non-transitory change in the price
of infliximab.
89. Not only are the infusion and non-infusion treatments different
kinds of therapies, but they are most often sold to different buyers,
on different contracts, and are distributed by different means:

Infliximab is, as described above, sold primarily to
hospitals and clinics and is almost never stocked by retail
pharmacies (only rarely being stocked by certain specialty
pharmacies). After administering the infusion treatments to
their patients, the hospitals and clinics seek reimbursement
from the patients' insurers or government payers.

By contrast, non-infusion drugs such as Xeljanz, Humira, and
Enbrel are primarily sold to and distributed in the pharmacy
channels. Physicians who prescribe these non-infusion drugs
generally do not administer the treatments and do not bear
financial risk with respect to the drug selected.

Non-infusion drugs are also typically covered by insurance
through a pharmacy benefit plan. These are products that
insured patients obtain using their ``pharmacy'' cards. Such
drugs are put out for bid periodically by insurers and/or
pharmacybenefit managers. The bidding process generally does
not even include infusion and other therapies not stocked in a
retail pharmacy.

By contrast, infusion therapies generally are treated as
part of the basic medical coverage provided by health insurers.
Infusion therapies are thus generally put out for bid
separately from self-administered therapies.
90. Beyond the medical reasons physicians may have for prescribing
an infusion therapy as opposed to a non-infusion therapy, patients
exhibit strong preferences for one form of therapy over another.
Patients with active lifestyles often prefer self-administered
treatments. Infusion therapy, on the other hand, is often preferred by
patients with needle aversions, or by patients who prefer to have their
treatments administered by medical professionals.
91. In addition, infusion and non-infusion therapies are offered at
very different price points: On an annual basis, Enbrel and Humira
(which are self-administered therapies) at list price are at least
twice as expensive as Remicade (which is an infusion therapy) for
patients stabilized on them.
92. Because of these various factors, a small but significant non-
transitory increase in price of infusion therapies would not have a
meaningful impact on the demand for non-infusion therapies, and vice-
versa.
93. As noted, the Relevant Product Market includes certain segments
that qualify themselves as Relevant Markets, in which J&J also
possesses monopolypower. For example:
94. Specific-use product markets. Specific-use product markets are
predicated on infusion-administered therapies for the Relevant
Indications. A small but significant nontransitory increase in price
for an infusion product in each of these specific-use product markets
would not cause substitution to non-infusion medicines approved for the
same indication. In each category, Remicade has been the dominant
infusion-administered therapy. The categories are as follows:

Infusion-administered therapies for Crohn's disease.
Remicade accounts for over 70 percent of prescriptions to
patients of infusion-based drugs indicated for Crohn's disease.

Infusion-administered therapies for rheumatoid arthritis.
Remicade accounts for nearly 55 percent of prescriptions to
patients of infusion-based drugs indicated for rheumatoid
arthritis. When combined with the share of its product Simponi
Aria, J&J commands an aggregate of nearly 65 percent of
prescriptions to patients in this category.

Infusion-administered therapies for ulcerative colitis.
Remicade accounts for nearly 70 percent of prescriptions to
patients of infusion-based drugs indicated for ulcerative
colitis.

Infusion-administered therapies for psoriatic arthritis.
Remicade accounts for over 95 percent of prescriptions to
patients of infusion-based drugs indicated for psoriatic
arthritis.

Infusion-administered therapies for ankylosing spondylitis.
Remicade accounts for over 95 percent of prescriptions to
patients of infusion-based drugs indicated for ankylosing
spondylitis.

Infusion-administered therapies for plaque psoriasis.
Remicade accounts for over 95 percent of prescriptions to
patients of infusion-based drugs for plaque psoriasis.
95. Clinic-based product market. The Relevant Product Market
encompasses a submarket consisting of sales of the Relevant Products to
non-hospital clinics (including freestanding clinics and physician
offices with infusion chairs) that administer infusion therapies to
patients. Such a submarket is properly treated as a relevant submarket
among other reasons because J&J is able to price discriminate between
hospitals and non-hospital clinics. The U.S. antitrust enforcement
agencies and economists recognize that relevant antitrust product
markets can be based on categories of customers against whom sellers
can exercise price discrimination, i.e., differential pricing.\27\ Non-
hospital clinics are subject to successful price discrimination by J&J.
J&J can and does identify and target clinics for differential pricing.
There are significant differences in the rebates and discounts J&J
makes available to non-hospital clinics as compared to hospital
customers. Moreover, a small but significant non-transitory increase in
the price of Remicade or other Relevant Products will not induce
infusion clinics to switch to self-administered therapies. A very
substantial percentage of provider accounts that purchase infliximab
are non-hospital clinics.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\27\
See, e.g., U.S. Department of Justice and Federal Trade
Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines (2010), Sec. 3.
96. Product markets for new and existing patients. As described
above, J&J has a substantial base of existing Remicade patients, the
substantial majority of whom are not likely to switch to another
therapy, even a biosimilar, if they have achieved relief with
Remicade--even in response to a small but significant non-
transitory increase in price for Remicade. By contrast, for new
patients who are candidates for infusion-administered therapies for the
Relevant Indications, Inflectra is a reasonable substitute for
Remicade. Thus, there is a distinct product market for sales of
Relevant Products to new patients in need of infusion-administered
therapies for the Relevant Indications. There is also a distinct
product market for patients already stabilized on Remicade--a market
dominated by Remicade. As described above, J&J's scheme has bundled its
control over the latter market (for patients stabilized on Remicade) to
thwart competition in the former market (for new patients in need of
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
infusion therapy).
97. Infliximab product market. After discovery, the data may also
support an infliximab-only product market. Among other things, J&J has
been able to raise prices for Remicade consistently without losing
significant sales to other branded drug products. Both J&J and Pfizer
consider Remicade and Inflectra to be particularly close substitutes.
For example, J&J's marketing materials focus on comparisons of price
and clinical effectiveness between Remicade and infliximab biosimilars,
and do not reference any other therapies, and its ``Biosimilar
Readiness Plan'' similarly ignores other therapies, focusing instead on
the unique competitive threat posed by biosimilars. Inflectra's
marketing materials likewise focus on Remicade, not on other therapies.
98. Barriers to entry. Substantial barriers to entry exist to
developing other infusion-administered drug therapies for the Relevant
Indications generally, and infusion-administered TNF inhibitors
specifically. The development of a new therapy requires tens if not
hundreds of millions of dollars and substantial risk, as any new
product must survive years of research and development, clinical
trials, and FDA approval. If left unchecked, J&J's conduct will serve
as an additional barrier to entry, as potential new entrants will
recognize that they will be unable to break J&J's ``rebate trap'' and
thus to profitably enter the Relevant Markets--and consequently will
not invest the resources necessary to develop biosimilars.
99. While a second biosimilar to Remicade has been approved--called
Renflexis, sponsored by Merck and Samsung--the sponsoring firms had to
overcome just the kind of substantial burdens noted above, and began
the effort long before J&J commenced its scheme to exclude biosimilar
competition. J&J itself has expressed confidence in maintaining its
Remicade dominance despite the potential entry of Renflexisbased on its
exclusionary contracting strategy. Pfizer has received marketplace
feedback that Renflexis will face the same access challenges from J&J's
scheme as Inflectra.
100. J&J's scheme--including coercive contracts bundling the
incontestable demand (existing patients) with contestable demand (new
patients), and promoting the results of its exclusionary insurer-level
contracts to create uncertainty about Inflectra among providers--has
led directly, with J&J's active encouragement, to nearly all provider
accounts that use infliximab declining to purchase Inflectra at all.
Even if some portion of a provider's patient base may be covered,
providers are unwilling to risk using Inflectra only to ultimately be
denied coverage. A single denied claim can cost a provider in excess of
$4,000, whereas the typical provider savings in product acquisition
cost for a covered Inflectra claim is $200-300. Because Remicade is
nearly universally covered, providers have taken the ``safe'' option
and stocked Remicade over Inflectra, thus increasing the already-
substantial foreclosure caused by J&J's exclusionary contracts. Thus,
as a practical matter, J&J's scheme has foreclosed Inflectra from
approximately 90 percent of provider accounts using infliximab, the
essential channel of distribution for infliximab. And, as noted, in
terms of sales, Remicade continues to control over 96 percent of
infliximab unit sales.
101. Geographic market. The relevant geographic market for the
Relevant Markets alleged herein is the United States of America and its
possessions and territories, as these products are marketed and sold on
a national basis.
J&J's CONDUCT HAS STIFLED COMPETITION IN THE RELEVANT MARKETS, THEREBY
MAINTAINING AND ENHANCING ITS MONOPOLY POWER AND INJURING PFIZER
102. J&J's scheme has led to the near total foreclosure of
Inflectra with patients across the country. First, its exclusionary
contracts with health insurers alone--including with most of the
largest health insurers in the country--have foreclosed Pfizer's
ability to compete for at least 70 percent of patients covered by
commercial health insurance plans in the United States. Second, J&J's
exclusionary contracts with certain providers have foreclosed Pfizer's
ability to compete even for patients covered by plans that do provide
reimbursement for Inflectra. And, as discussed, the reimbursement
challenges (created by J&J) have led most provider accounts to decline
to purchase Inflectra at all, with approximately 90 percent of provider
accounts that use infliximab across the country not stocking Inflectra
at all. As of September 2017, J&J maintained over 96 percent share of
infliximab unit sales in the U.S.
103. Despite vigorous efforts to compete--including offering
guarantees that Inflectra would be less expensive unit-for-unit than
Remicade--Pfizer has been foreclosed from gaining a competitive
foothold as a direct result of J&J's scheme. In the absence of
Remicade's exclusionary practices, Inflectra's growth in the Relevant
Markets would be substantially greater than it has been, and would be
substantially larger in the future. J&J's conduct has deprived Pfizer
of (a) past profits; (b) future profits; and (c) the value of invested
capital from unrealized efforts to enter and expand in the Relevant
Markets. Further, Pfizer's current and prospective customer
relationships and goodwill have been, and will continue to be,
impaired. J&J's conduct, if allowed to continue, will also dampen the
incentives of Pfizer and other biosimilar developers to invest the
substantial resources needed to bring biosimilars to the market. Thus,
the aims of the BPCIA will have been thwarted.
104. J&J's activities have not only harmed Pfizer, they have caused
substantial harm to the competitive process as well as to government
payers and to consumers, who have been deprived of the principal
benefits of competition--more choices and lower prices. The
anticompetitive effects of J&J's conduct are evident in its pricing of
Remicade since Inflectra's entry. Despite the fact that Pfizer has
offered substantial discounts and a lower ASP to compete for business
with insurers and healthcare providers, J&J has been able to increase
the price of Remicade without losing any significant share or volume of
sales to Pfizer (or any other competitor). J&J's prices for Remicade
have been increasing by every measure. J&J has increased Remicade list
prices twice since FDA approval of Inflectra. These increases alone
raised Remicade's list price nearly 9 percent. Remicade's actual ASP
(which, as noted above, is net of discounts, rebates, and other price
concessions) has also increased since Inflectra's entry-- negating any
claim that J&J's rebates qualify as meaningful price competition.
105. There is no efficiency or cost-reducing justification for
J&J's coercive and exclusionary insurer- or provider-level contract
terms. J&J has not achieved improved production costs, or economies of
scale or scope through its contracting strategies. J&J also has
achieved no improvements in the Remicade treatment through its
contracting strategies.
106. If J&J's conduct is not prohibited, it will be adopted by
other originator biologics firms aiming to preserve their dominant
positions. As the first major biosimilar approval, this case will be a
bellwether for the success of Congress's biosimilars initiative, as
embodied in the BPCIA.
CLAIMS FOR RELIEF
FIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Violation of 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2
Monopolization of All Relevant Markets
107. Pfizer repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 106 as set
forth herein.
108. J&J has monopolized the Relevant Markets in violation of
Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
109. J&J has monopoly power in the Relevant Markets.
110. Through the scheme described above, and other conduct likely
to be revealed in discovery, J&J has willfully and unlawfully
maintained and enhanced its monopoly power in violation of Section 2 of
the Sherman Act. J&J's scheme constitutes exclusionary conduct within
the meaning of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
111. J&J's scheme has stifled competition in the Relevant Markets
and thwarted Congress's purpose in enacting the BPCIA.
112. Among other things, given that (a) J&J imposed explicit
conditions that insurers and providers eliminate (or almost completely
curtail) their dealings with infliximab biosimilars, and (b) J&J's ASP
for Remicade has actually increased since the biosimilar entered, J&J's
pricing is not the clearly predominant means by which competition has
been foreclosed in the Relevant Markets.
113. Even if price were deemed to be the clearly predominant means
by which competition has been foreclosed, when the total amount of
discounts and rebates that J&J offers to insurers and providers under
the contracts described herein, including multi-product bundle
contracts, is attributed to the portion of Remicade sales that is
contestable by a biosimilar like Inflectra, J&J is pricing Remicade
below its own average variable cost.
114. As a result of J&J's conduct, and the harm to competition
caused by that conduct, Pfizer has suffered substantial and continuing
injuries.
SECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Violation of 15 U.S.C. Sec. 2
Attempted Monopolization of All Relevant Markets
115. Pfizer repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 114 as set
forth herein.
116. J&J has attempted to monopolize the Relevant Markets in
violation of Section 2 of the Sherman Act.
117. J&J is violating Section 2 of the Sherman Act by attempting to
implement the anticompetitive scheme set forth above with the specific
intent to monopolize the Relevant Markets. J&J's scheme constitutes
exclusionary conduct within the meaning of Section 2 of the Sherman
Act.
118. There is a dangerous probability that J&J will succeed in
monopolizing the Relevant Markets through its anticompetitive scheme.
119. J&J's scheme has stifled competition in the Relevant Markets and
thwarted Congress's purpose in enacting the BPCIA.
120. Among other things, given that (a) J&J imposed explicit
conditions that insurers and providers eliminate (or almost completely
curtail) their dealings with infliximab biosimilars, and (b) J&J's ASP
for Remicade has actually increased since the biosimilar entered, J&J's
pricing is not the clearly predominant means by which competition is
dangerously likely to be foreclosed in the Relevant Markets.
121. Even if price were deemed to be the clearly predominant means
by which competition is dangerously likely to be foreclosed, when the
total amount of discounts and rebates that J&J offers to insurers and
providers under the contracts described herein, including multi-product
bundle contracts, is attributed to the portion of Remicade sales that
is contestable by a biosimilar like Inflectra, J&J is pricing Remicade
below its own average variable cost.
122. As a result of J&J's conduct, and the harm to competition
caused by that conduct, Pfizer has suffered substantial and continuing
injuries.
THIRD CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Violation of 15 U.S.C. Sec. 14
Sale on Condition to Exclude Inflectra and Other Infliximab Biosimilars
or Impose a Fail First Requirement and to Force Use of Remicade in All
Relevant Markets
123. Pfizer repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 122 as set
forth herein.
124. J&J has entered into agreements with insurers (which reimburse
Remicade) and providers (which purchase Remicade), whereby it has
conditioned the availability of discounts, rebates, and/or other price
concessions on insurers and/or providers eliminating or drastically
curtailing their dealings with Inflectra (or any other infliximab
biosimilar).
125. J&J's agreements function as exclusive agreements, what are
for all practical purposes sole-source agreements, the effect of which
is to foreclose substantially competition from rivals, such as Pfizer,
in the sale of the infliximab to medical providers, in violation of
Section 3 of the Clayton Act.
126. The essence of the J&J-insurer contracts is to pay the
insurers to exclude biosimilar alternatives from their prescription
drug or medical benefits coverage, whereby the insurers either deny
coverage altogether or restrict coverage to only the rarest of
circumstances. The insurers, as the payers for the treatment, have the
ability to exclude selected drugs from coverage and as a result,
patients and providers do not have a practical ability to choose
Inflectra or other infliximab biosimilars over Remicade where coverage
is not available. Moreover, because insurers wield power over providers
with the ability to grant or withhold coverage for treatment, and
because providers are risk-averse when it comes to buying and stocking
medications such as infliximab, the providers are effectively compelled
to stock Remicade exclusively.
127. The intent and effect of the insurers' performance of these
contracts is to cause providers to forgo alternatives and to drive all
treatment sales to J&J. The result of the J&J insurer contracts thus is
the amplification of foreclosure, such that Inflectra and other
biosimilars are denied access to approximately 90 percent of provider
accounts and foreclosed from competition in the Relevant Markets.
128. Because providers and insurers are the gateway for the
distribution and sale of the Relevant Products, there are no viable
alternative means of distribution or sale and substantial foreclosure
exists. Biosimilar competitors to J&J have no practical alternative
means of selling infliximab to patients.
129. These de facto exclusive arrangements are in effect durable
long-term agreements because the incentives J&J has exploited are not
likely to change. So long as J&J's contracts remain in place,
biosimilars will not be able to dent J&J's base of existing patients,
and the incentives underlying J&J's contracts will remain. No insurer
can practically walk away from and not continue to perform under the
J&J agreement due to the above-discussed penalties.
130. The effect of each such agreement is and has been to
substantially lessen competition in the Relevant Markets. The aggregate
impact of such agreements is and has been to substantially lessen
competition or tend to create a monopoly in the Relevant Markets.
131. By imposing such conditional contracts, J&J is directly and
proximately foreclosing Pfizer and other competitors from a substantial
portion of the Relevant Markets.
132. J&J's conduct has had anticompetitive effects in the Relevant
Markets, including, without limitation, the effects described above in
Paragraphs 102 through 106.
133. As a result of J&J's conduct, and the harm to competition
caused by that conduct, Pfizer has suffered substantial and continuing
injuries.
FOURTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Violation of 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1
Agreements in Restraint of Trade in All Relevant Markets
134. Pfizer repeats and realleges Paragraphs 1 through 133 as set
forth herein.
135. J&J has entered into agreements with insurers and providers of
Remicade with the purpose and effect of unreasonably restraining trade
and commerce in the Relevant Markets.
136. J&J's solicitation and enforcement of the exclusionary
contracts described above constitute unlawful agreements, contracts,
and concerted activity that unreasonably restrain trade in the Relevant
Markets in violation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act.
137. J&J's conduct has had anticompetitive effects in the Relevant
Markets, including, without limitation, the effects described above in
Paragraphs 102 through 106.
138. Among other things, given that (a) J&J imposed explicit
conditions that insurers and providers eliminate (or almost completely
curtail) their dealings with infliximab biosimilars, and (b) J&J's ASP
for Remicade has actually increased since the biosimilar entered, J&J's
pricing is not the clearly predominant means by which competition has
been foreclosed in the Relevant Markets.
139. Even if price were deemed to be the clearly predominant means
by which competition has been foreclosed, when the total amount of
discounts and rebates that J&J offers to insurers and providers under
the contracts described herein, including multi-product bundle
contracts, is attributed to the portion of Remicade sales that is
contestable by a biosimilar like Inflectra, J&J is pricing Remicade
below its own average variable cost.
140. As a result of J&J's conduct, and the harm to competition
caused by that conduct, Pfizer has suffered substantial and continuing
injuries.
PRAYER FOR RELIEF
141. WHEREFORE, Pfizer respectfully prays that the Court enter
judgment against J&J and in favor of Pfizer, as follows:
a.
Awarding Pfizer money damages, trebled pursuant to
law, in an amount in excess of $150,000.00 (exclusive of
interest and costs);
b.
Awarding Pfizer the costs of the lawsuit, including
its reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs;
c.
Declaring J&J's conduct unlawful and in violation of
the above-
referenced statutes;
d.
Entering appropriate preliminary and permanent
injunctive relief barring J&J from continuing to undertake its
anticompetitive scheme, including its exclusionary contracts;
and
e.
Ordering such other and further relief as the Court
may deem just, proper, and equitable.
JURY TRIAL DEMANDED
142.
Pfizer demands a trial by jury for all issues triable by
jury.

Counsel for Pfizer Inc.
______
Prepared Statement of Olivier Brandicourt, M.D.,
Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi
Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the
committee, thank you for the opportunity to appear before the Senate
Committee on Finance to discuss pharmaceutical pricing, affordability,
and patient access in the United States. I am Dr. Olivier Brandicourt,
the chief executive officer of Sanofi.
At Sanofi, we work passionately every day to understand and address
the health care needs of patients around the world. We are dedicated to
solving patients' most serious health challenges in numerous
therapeutic areas, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
immunology, oncology, multiple sclerosis (MS), rare diseases, and rare
blood disorders. We are also devoted to preventing diseases through the
research, development, and delivery of vaccines. And we contribute to
improving the health of people around the world through our broad
portfolio of consumer health products.
Sanofi's U.S. subsidiaries have a rich history in the United States
dating back over 100 years. We currently employ more than 13,000
professionals across the United States in a broad range of critical
roles, including business operations, research and development, and
manufacturing, with our most significant presence in Massachusetts,
where we are the largest employer in the life sciences industry, and
major centers of operation in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee.
Last year, Sanofi spent almost $7 billion on research and
development, an increase of approximately 7 percent from 2017, which
reflects our commitment to bringing better therapies to patients.
Sanofi plans to maintain this level of R&D investment through 2021, and
our R&D pipeline now contains 81 projects, including 33 new molecular
entities in clinical development, and 35 projects that are in Phase III
or have been submitted to regulatory authorities. This investment means
that Sanofi potentially will seek approval for nine new medications in
the next three years, primarily in therapeutic areas where Sanofi sees
the greatest nexus between our expertise and patient need: diabetes,
vaccines, oncology, immunology, rare diseases, and rare blood
disorders.
Our work in R&D includes more than a dozen compounds for the
treatment of various kinds of cancers, and we are employing cutting-
edge approaches in an effort to make significant advances for patients.
Our research includes potential treatments to help the body's own
immune system fight cancer, and antibody drug conjugates that we
believe can deliver cytotoxic drugs to tumors while sparing normal
tissue. Earlier this month, we announced successful results with one
such candidate in a mid-stage trial in lung cancer, and we intend to
initiate a pivotal study later this year.
i. rising costs for patients
While the research and development landscape has fundamentally
changed, the landscape in which patients access medications has also
fundamentally changed, and not for the better. Affordability of
medicines is a real and growing challenge for too many Americans. We
understand the anger of patients who cannot afford the medicines they
or their loved ones need due to rising out-of-pocket drug costs.
There is no single root cause to the problem of rising patient out-
of-pocket costs, and in order to develop meaningful solutions for
patients, it is critical to take a comprehensive look at what is
driving rising costs for patients. Given the number of factors that
contribute to determining out-of-pocket costs for patients, every part
of the supply chain, including manufacturers, has a role to play in
solving this problem.
We want everyone--including patients, providers, payers, pharmacy
benefit managers (PBMs), policy makers, and regulators--to understand
why we set prices as we do, and to reaffirm our commitment to our core
principles of access, affordability and innovation. An important
component of pricing includes the intersection between the list prices
of our medicines, the net prices we actually receive after accounting
for all rebates and other discounts, and out-of-pocket costs.
While list prices often receive the most attention, they reflect
the initial price we set for our medicines. They are not the amount
Sanofi receives nor the prices typically paid by government and
commercial insurers, employers, or PBMs. Under the current system,
players within the supply chain--including PBMs, plans, wholesalers,
distributors, and group purchasing organizations--receive either
rebates and/or fees based on a percentage of the list price. Their
economic incentives are therefore directly linked to the list price.
And as long as the net price grows at a predictable rate, the greater
the list price, the greater the economic returns for many players in
the supply chain. Manufacturers, in turn, must account for anticipated
rebates and other discounts when setting their list price.
Thus, list price is the starting point for negotiations with
payers, and it is often the basis for patient out-of-pocket costs. But
focusing solely on the list price does not tell the whole story. In the
current system, manufacturers pay significant rebates as a percentage
of the list price to both government and private payers, as well as
other intermediaries, in an effort to improve access for patients. In
2018, 55 percent of Sanofi's gross sales were given back to payers as
rebates, including $4.5 billion in mandatory rebates to government
payers and $7.3 billion in discretionary rebates. As described later in
my testimony, due to these rebates, the average aggregate net price of
our products, including our insulin products, actually has declined
over the last number of years.
Sanofi provides rebates to PBMs and health plans to improve patient
access to, and affordability for, Sanofi medicines. We want these
rebates, which lower net prices, to benefit patients. Unfortunately,
under the current system, savings from rebates are not consistently
passed through to patients in the form of lower deductibles, co-
payments or coinsurance amounts.
For some patients, out-of-pocket costs are calculated based on a
medicine's list price. However, based on variability in plan design,
the list price alone does not explain patients' increasing
affordability issues.

Sales Returns: Netted with Clawback, Other Corrections/Credit Memos
------------------------------------------------------------------------
For instance, in some cases, affordability issues are the result of
changes in health plan designs, such as the increase in the number of
high deductible health plans. Among those with private health
insurance, enrollment in high deductible health plans (HDHPs) has
generally increased since 2010. The design of these plans generally
requires patients to pay the full list price of medicines during the
deductible phase of the program, rather than the negotiated drug price
available when the insurance portion kicks in.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
In other cases, affordability issues are caused by changes in
insurance design which increasingly ask patients to pay higher cost-
sharing for their medicines, even when the price of those medicines has
stayed relatively flat or has declined for the health plan. For
example, as noted later in my testimony, the average net price of
Lantus, our most prescribed insulin, has declined by over 30 percent
since 2012, while the average out-of-pocket burden for patients with
commercial insurance and Medicare has increased by approximately 60
percent over that same period. In this case, not only are discounts
apparently not being passed on to patients, but patients are in fact
being asked to pay more when PBMs and health plans are paying less for
the medicine. This situation defies logic and should not happen.
Increasing out-of-pocket costs also can result from changes to
prescription drug formularies, which have a significant impact on the
amount of out-of-pocket costs a patient will be asked to pay. A recent
opinion piece in The New York Times \1\ powerfully highlights how
changes to prescription drug formularies not only can create confusion
and frustration for providers and patients, but also ultimately
increase costs for patients when the medicines they need are not
covered on a formulary's preferred tier.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ See https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/18/opinion/cost-insurance-
diabetes-insulin.html.
The impact of the role each of these factors plays in out-of-pocket
costs for any individual patient is highly variable, thus compounding
the complexity of this issue. Out-of-pocket costs for a medicine for
any particular patient depend on a number of factors in addition to
list price, including: (1) what portion, if any, of a manufacturer's
rebates a PBM or payer passes through to the patient, (2) the benefit
design of the patient's health plan, and (3) the level of reimbursement
negotiated between the patient's plan and the particular pharmacy. Each
of these factors varies significantly among plans and pharmacies--even
within the same health insurance company or PBM receiving the same
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
manufacturer rebate--creating confusion and frustration for patients.
Given the complexity in the system and number of factors that
impact out-of-
pocket costs, every part of the health-care system has an obligation to
work to solve this problem. I am grateful that this Committee--and
others--are taking a holistic approach to collecting information both
on what is causing the problem for patients, and also on solutions to
address patient access and affordability without undermining the
incentives and rewards for scientific risk-taking and discovery that
are the hallmark of the United States ecosystem and economy.
I am here today to share Sanofi's story, the actions we have taken
to improve patient access and affordability, and our ideas about what
more can be done.
ii. sanofi actions to improve patient access and affordability
As a global health-care leader, Sanofi has a long-standing
commitment to promoting health-care systems and policies that make our
treatments accessible and affordable to patients in need. We believe we
can play an important role in the development of constructive solutions
that will benefit both patients and the health-care system as a whole.
I will address some of our ongoing initiatives and recommendations for
solutions in my testimony.
Sanofi's ultimate goal, detailed below, is to encourage a
transition to a value-
driven health-care system that provides incentives for continued
improvements in patient care while increasing access and affordability.
Given the complexities of the current system, changes must be
approached thoughtfully, with a focus on establishing processes that
will both enable affordable access to treatment and protect innovation
in an era of potentially transformative scientific advancements.
Sanofi is--and will continue to be--an industry leader in helping
to address this challenge. While many factors, including decisions
affecting patient out-of-pocket spending and insurance coverage, are
influenced or controlled by others in the health-care system, including
other manufacturers, we recognize that there are actions we can take to
help improve access and affordability for patients. For our part, we
recognize that we must price our medicines transparently and according
to their value, while at the same time contributing to broader
solutions that improve patient outcomes and the financial
sustainability of the U.S. health-care system.
Policy changes are required across the entire health care system.
But we are not waiting for systemic change to arrive before taking
action. Sanofi has adopted a variety of approaches to work within the
current system to improve access and affordability for patients.
Whether it has been launching new medicines in multiple sclerosis and
rheumatoid arthritis at disruptively low prices, limiting price
increases to an external benchmark of overall medical spending, or
lowering the net price of a medicine, Sanofi has approached the
challenge of access and affordability not with words, but with actions.
iii. sanofi pricing principles and actions
Two years ago, Sanofi announced our progressive and industry-
leading pricing principles to help stakeholders understand our pricing
decisions and to advance a more informed discussion of issues related
to the pricing of medicines.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ See https://www.sanofi.us/-/media/Project/One-Sanofi-Web/
Websites/North-America/Sanofi-US/Home/corporateresponsibility/
Prescription_Medicine_Pricing_2019.pdf.
These principles include a pledge to keep annual list price
increases at or below the projected U.S. National Health Expenditure
(NHE) growth rate, an estimate of medical spending calculated by the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and often used as a
measure of healthcare inflation. These principles apply to all of our
prescription medicines if a pricing decision results in more than a $15
annual increase in the price of the medication. In addition, we
committed to making both our average aggregate list and net price
changes across our portfolio transparent to help illustrate how revenue
accrues to Sanofi versus other parts of the pharmaceutical supply
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
chain.
In 2018, all of our price increases were consistent with our
policy, as are all pricing actions we have taken in 2019. Across our
entire portfolio of medicines, the average aggregate list price
increase was 4.6 percent while the average aggregate net price--that
is, the actual price paid to Sanofi--declined by 8.0 percent.
The declining average aggregate net price in 2018 represents the
third consecutive year the amount that health plans and PBMs pay Sanofi
for our medicines has declined.

contracting.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
In addition to our pledge to limit price increases in the U.S.,
Sanofi's pricing policy includes a commitment to transparency in how we
price new medicines coming to the market for the first time. When we
set the price of a new medicine, we hold ourselves to a rigorous and
structured process that includes consultation with external
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
stakeholders and considers four factors:
(1)
A holistic assessment of value, including (a) clinical
value and outcomes, or the benefit the medicine delivers to
patients, and how well it works compared to a standard of care;
(b) economic value, or how the medicine reduces the need--and
therefore costs--of other health care interventions; and (c)
social value, or how the medicine contributes to quality of
life and productivity. Our assessments rely on a range of
internal and external methodologies, including health
technology assessment (HTA) approaches and other analyses that
help define or quantify value and include patient perspectives
and priorities.
(2)
Similar treatment options available or anticipated at the
time of launch in order to understand the competitive landscape
within the disease areas in which the medicine may be used.
(3)
Affordability, including the steps we must take to promote
access for patients and contribute to a more sustainable system
for payers and health-care delivery systems.
(4)
Unique factors specific to the medicine at the time of
launch. For example, we may need to support ongoing clinical
trials to provide additional critical information on the value
of the product (e.g., longer-term outcomes studies), implement
important regulatory commitments, or develop sophisticated
patient support tools that improve care management and help
decrease the total cost of care.
Using this approach, Sanofi has launched a number of highly
innovative products at prices well below the competition, some even
before our principles were officially adopted.

In 2012, Sanofi launched Aubagio ', a medicine
used to treat relapsing forms of MS, at a list price more than
25 percent below the other approved oral MS medication on the
market at the time.

In 2017, we launched Kevzara ', a second line
medication used to treat certain types of rheumatoid arthritis
(RA), at a list price 30 percent below other leading treatments
for RA. After completing a head to head study against the
market-leading anti-TNF, Kevzara was found superior in RA
patients.

In 2017, we launched Dupixent ', the first drug
of its kind for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis,
specifically within the cost-effectiveness range provided by
the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) of
$37,000, compelling the Chief Medical Officer for a leading PBM
to say ``this is how pricing should work.'' While we have
concerns about ICER's methodology in many of their drug
reviews, our willingness to work with ICER is further
demonstration to our commitment to price our medicines based on
the value they provide with consideration of input from a
third-party analysis.

In 2018, we launched Admelog ' at the lowest list
price of any mealtime insulin.

In February 2019, Sanofi and Regeneron announced that
Praluent ' will be made available at a new reduced
U.S. list price. Beginning in early March, new U.S. National
Drug Code (NDC) option will be available at approximately 60
percent less than the original list price for the drug. This
action follows our earlier announcement in March 2018, when
Sanofi and Regeneron committed to lowering the U.S. net price
for payers in return for reducing burdensome access barriers
for appropriate patients.\4\ Sanofi and Regeneron took the
additional step of announcing a new NDC to further assist
patients, particularly in Part D, who still face cost-sharing
linked to the list price, and who were thus not helped by the
earlier net price reduction. With the new lower-priced
Praluent, most Medicare Part D patients are expected to save as
much as $345 per month, depending on their insurance plan.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ See http://www.news.sanofi.us/2018-03-10-Sanofi-and-Regeneron-
announce-plans-to-make-Praluent-R-more-accessible-and-affordable-for-
patients-with-the-greatest-health-risk-and-unmet-need.
With the right incentives in the system, our approach to setting
launch prices for these new medicines would have had the effect of
ensuring affordable access for patients. Unfortunately, because of the
way the U.S. health care system is currently constructed, our
experience has shown that pricing medicines at lower list prices has
failed to result in adequate access or affordability for most patients.
For instance, since Dupixent was launched, rebates have been required
in most cases to secure access for patients. Despite the responsible
list price and subsequent rebates, 8 commercial and 2 Medicaid plans
nevertheless implemented a step edit requiring patients to try
immunosuppressant therapy first before using Dupixent. They implemented
this step edit notwithstanding the fact that immunosuppressant therapy
is not FDA approved for use in atopic dermatitis and is referenced as a
worst-case scenario for patients in practice guidelines due to its
questionable benefit-risk profile.
iv. sanofi's insulin products: a case study
We feel a special obligation to address the pressing issues around
access and affordability of insulin products. In my time as CEO, Sanofi
has made a concerted effort to improve both system sustainability and
patient affordability in our approach to our portfolio of insulin
products, which includes six different products to meet individualized
patient needs. And it is important to note the evolution and innovation
of insulin, as we are often asked if anything has changed in the last
100 years that warrants pricing action.
Sanofi's groundbreaking discovery of insulin glargine, and its
development of a novel pre-filled disposable injection pen to deliver
insulin glargine, have profoundly improved the lives of millions of
patients living with diabetes in the United States and worldwide.
Sanofi's insulin glargine drug products are sold under the trade names
Lantus ', Lantus SoloSTAR ', Toujeo SoloSTAR
', and Toujeo Max SoloSTAR ', each of which
represents a significant leap forward in the treatment of diabetes.
Sanofi has been awarded patents for its innovative technologies on each
of these products.
These novel drug products began with Sanofi's discovery of insulin
glargine. Despite having ``insulin'' in its name, Sanofi's insulin
glargine is markedly different from prior insulin products, which had a
relatively short duration of action and required patients to inject
themselves multiple times a day and wake up at night for injections in
order to control blood glucose levels. Each injection of prior insulin
products caused a sharp spike in the patient's insulin levels, which
could cause symptoms of low blood sugar ranging from shakiness and
confusion to, in the extreme, coma or death. Injections also had to be
timed before every meal, disrupting patient's lives, sleep times, and
ability to eat with friends and family. As such, the consistent goals
of insulin therapy over the last century have included reducing the
frequency of insulin administration and flattening the post-
administration peak of insulin in the bloodstream. Prior attempts to
achieve these goals included cumbersome mechanical pumps that had to be
worn on the body for constant infusion, and NPH insulin, which had an
intermediate duration of action but still caused a pronounced peak in
insulin levels.
Glargine changed all of that. Sanofi scientists, in a remarkable
feat of protein engineering, succeeded in fundamentally altering the
human insulin molecule at the amino acid level, changing its
pharmacological characteristics to give patients a steady release of
insulin with just a single daily administration. Unlike anything that
came before it, glargine forms tiny solid crystals upon injection that
dissipate over time to provide a flatter, stable, long-lasting effect
that mimics the flat profile of insulin release from a healthy pancreas
and reduces the risks caused by low blood sugar. The once-daily
administration of glargine also proved a significant boon to patient
lifestyles.
Insulin is also an excellent example of list prices not reflecting
the actual prices paid by insurance companies, and out-of-pocket costs
that continue to rise despite lower net prices. The net price of our
insulin product Lantus ', for example, has fallen over 30
percent since 2012; yet, over this same period, average out-of-pocket
costs for patients with commercial insurance and Medicare--before the
benefit of any Sanofi financial assistance program--has risen 60
percent.
v. sanofi's financial assistance programs
Our commitment to affordability for patients extends beyond
responsible launch pricing, limited price increases, and transparency.
We offer a suite of traditional and innovative patient assistance
programs to enable appropriate patient access and to help patients
afford the Sanofi medicines prescribed to them. We publicize our
programs in a number of ways to ensure patients and providers are aware
of our offerings, including through advertising online, on television,
as well as in provider office settings and at pharmacies.
As noted previously in my testimony, rising out-of-pocket costs for
patients is a complex problem with many causes. In some cases, access
issues are linked to lack of insurance. But having insurance is no
longer a guarantee of affordable care, and Sanofi believes it is also
critical to address the needs of patients who may be exposed to
excessive cost-sharing based on insurance plan design or other
deficiencies in the system.
Because patient situations are different, we have carefully
tailored our assistance programs for insulin products to meet a variety
of patient needs:

Commercially insured patients qualify for our co-pay
assistance program, which reduces the financial burden for
insulin products. Through this program, over 90 percent of
participating commercially insured patients pay either $10 or
$0 per month for their Sanofi-manufactured insulin products.
Last year, our co-pay assistance programs for commercially
insured patients provided more than 400,000 eligible patients
with $342 million in patient savings.

For diabetes patients who do not qualify for one of our co-
pay assistance programs, we created the Insulins ValYOU Savings
Program in 2018. The purpose of this program is to provide
relief for those patients who currently pay high variable
retail prices for insulin and do not qualify for other
assistance programs. Through this program, eligible individuals
can access all Sanofi insulins for $99 per 10 mL vial or $149
for a pack of SoloStar pens, approximately a one-month supply
of insulin,\5\ at a discount of up to 60 percent discount below
the list price, resulting in potential savings of up to $3,000
per year. There are no income requirements and the program is
available at U.S. pharmacies. Last year (its first year), the
program resulted in $6.2 million in patient savings.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ Patients with type 1 diabetes require insulin replacement with
both long-acting (basal) and mealtime (bolus) insulin. An average adult
with type 1 diabetes who weighs 70 kg (155 pounds) should be taking
anywhere from 0.5-1.0 u/kg/day--depending upon activity levels, and
meal choices. Using the higher daily dose of 1.0 u/kg/day, this patient
would need a total of 70 units/day of insulin, of which approximately
half should be mealtime (bolus) insulin and half should be long-acting
(basal) insulin. For this average patient, one vial of long-acting
(basal) and one vial of mealtime (bolus) insulin could provide a
monthly supple of insulin.
Many patients with type 2 diabetes require long-acting (basal)
insulin only. Our internal data shows the average daily dose is
approximately 45 units per day, resulting in a monthly requirement of
1350 units of long-acting (basal) insulin per month. Lantus SoloSTAR
' pack contains 1500 units of insulin (5 pens x 300 units
per pen) and Toujeo SoloSTAR ' pack contains 1350 units of
insulin (3 pens x 450 units per pen). For the average patient with type
2 diabetes, the ValYOU Savings Program would meet the monthly insulin
requirement with one payment of $149. Patients on lower doses of Lantus
may opt for the 10ml vial, which would meet the monthly insulin
requirement with one payment of $99.

For eligible low-income patients, Sanofi offers many of our
medicines, including our insulin products, at no charge through
its Sanofi Patient Connection patient assistance program. We
are proud that, in 2018, more than 93,000 patients participated
in the Sanofi Patient Connection program, receiving free
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
medicine valued at $508 million.
While Sanofi alone cannot eliminate the issue of patient
affordability, no matter how comprehensive or innovative our patient
assistance programs, we believe that our efforts can make a meaningful
difference for many patients. We are committed to maintaining these
programs and raising awareness of these options to the patients who
need them.
vi. policy proposals
Over the past few years, we have led by example and made decisions
to help improve access and affordability for patients. I am here today
to tell you that I know our actions, while well-intentioned, have not
been enough. I hope we can all agree on market-based policy solutions
that will incentivize a high-value, sustainable health-care system that
improves the affordability of innovative medicines in the U.S.
Based on our experience, targeting list price controls alone will
not be sufficient to address patient access and affordability. That is
why the solution to drug pricing must include protections for patients,
tying responsible pricing to both access and affordability for
patients.
There are obviously a variety of ways to accomplish this, and
Sanofi could support any number of options that align to our core
principles:
(1)
The U.S. should continue to maintain a strong ecosystem
for innovation. As such, any policy proposals should strictly
avoid directly and artificially controlling the price of
medicines, either through price controls set by the Federal
Government, or worse, outsourcing that decision to foreign
governments. Policy proposals that we believe would
fundamentally undermine the unique innovation ecosystem of the
United States include reference pricing, importation, or price
controls set by CMS. Based on our experience, these approaches
may be effective at controlling budgets for central payers but
come at a steep cost for patients--namely limiting access to
innovative treatments. Additionally, given that the U.S. is the
world's leader in science and innovation--and the jobs that
come with it--these approaches pose additional risks to the
U.S. economy and future scientific discovery. Finally, and most
importantly, given the differences between systems, these
approaches may do little to improve access and affordability
for patients.
As we have experienced, within the current system,
declining prices for payers or new treatments priced at
responsibly lower list prices are no guarantee that those
actions will translate to affordability or access for patients.
(2)
Changes to the pricing system must be holistic, and the
majority of benefits should accrue to patients. As noted
previously, simply enacting price controls--either set by a
State, Federal, or foreign government--will not solve the
problem of access and affordability for patients. We believe
system incentives need to change to encourage smaller list
price increases, or even list price reductions, by requiring
health plans to cover those medicines that meet these standards
at an affordable co-pay level and only allow access
restrictions consistent with the label and accepted evidence-
based best clinical practice.
If policies are enacted that solely target the list price
of medicines without these common-sense patient protections,
our shared goal of lowering drug costs--for both government and
patients while maintaining the engine of innovation in the
United States to bring new innovative medicines to patients
will not be fully achieved. To appropriately accomplish this
objective, Sanofi is willing to trade price for access and
affordability and share accountability for offsetting the
financial impact on the Medicare programs.
Sanofi supports and recommends several policy solutions to
incentivize responsible pricing behavior. To ensure that these
changes do not create a windfall for manufacturers or health
plans and PBMs, Sanofi recommends applying these policies only
to medicines that satisfy certain limits on price increases.
This approach will shift the current incentives in the system
to reward ``good'' behavior in a manner that truly helps
patients. Several of the solutions outlined below are also
priorities for Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden and
other members of this committee and I look forward to the
opportunity to work with you on advancing these and other
policy initiatives:
First, reducing out-of-pocket costs for patients is our top
priority. As we have experienced, limiting list price of
medicines alone is not sufficient to fully solve this problem.
Sanofi has identified a number of ways to effectively reduce
out-of-pocket costs for consumers and broadly supports
tradeoffs between price and access to help patients, including:

Implementation of the Anti-Kickback Safe Harbor rebate
proposed rule in a manner that directly lowers out-of-pocket
costs for patients without creating loopholes that would
undermine the proposed rule's intent.

Requiring a portion of the discounts and rebates paid by
manufacturers to reduce costs for patients at the pharmacy
counter.

Changing government price reporting rules and the Anti-
Kickback statute in a manner that would promote value-based
contracting.

Implementing an annual out-of-pocket cap for Medicare
beneficiaries.

Allowing manufacturers to offer co-pay assistance to
Medicare beneficiaries.

Changing or clarifying government price reporting rules
to make it easier to reduce list prices on medicines that have
been on the market for a long time--namely by (1) making clear
that the government pricing metrics for the new, lower list
price drug do not have to be averaged with the metrics for
older, higher list price drug and (2) permitting a company to
treat the new lower price drug as a new product for purposes of
Medicaid rebate calculations, which will help to link the
rebate liability for the new drug to the new drug's lower price
as opposed to the higher price for the old drug.
Second, Sanofi supports policies that cultivate a highly
competitive free market system and rewards the type of
entrepreneurial risk-taking necessary to the discovery and
development of life-saving new medicines. A key element of that
system is a strong and predictable intellectual property
system. However, after a reasonable period of time--which I
believe is already reflected in U.S. law--generic and
biosimilar medicines should quickly enter the market to offer
long-term access at lower costs. To help accomplish these
goals, Sanofi supports:

Legislation that promotes competition, such as the
CREATES Act, and prohibitions on ``reverse payment''
agreements. While some changes may be needed to avoid
unintended consequences, we support moving forward with
policies that limit manufacturers' ability to unfairly avoid
competition. At Sanofi, we make product supply available to
generic and biosimilar manufacturers developing data necessary
for FDA applications for their products. We do this in a timely
manner and on reasonable terms.

Increased system-wide transparency, which would improve
competition across health care by making relevant information
available to patients and policymakers. Providing more
information about what is driving costs in the system and how
money is flowing through the system will allow for increased
competition and better-informed decision making. Policies like
the SPIKE Act, which appropriately include a threshold for
reporting to incentivize responsible pricing behavior and the
C-THRU Act, are potential approaches.
vii. conclusion
I look forward to having a productive conversation about the
complexities of the current prescription drug pricing system and
proposals to improve affordable patient access to high quality,
innovative medications to drive optimal health outcomes.
Thank you for the invitation to speak with you today and I look
forward to working with you.
______
Questions Submitted for the Record to Olivier Brandicourt, M.D.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
Question. The Department of Health and Human Services' proposed
rule, ``Fraud and Abuse; Removal of Safe Harbor Protection for Rebates
Involving Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Creation of New Safe Harbor
Protection for Certain Point-of-Sale Reductions in Price on
Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Certain Pharmacy Benefit Manager
Service Fees,'' envisions that drug manufacturers will offer up-front
discounts rather than the back-end rebates that are now commonly
provided. Some observers argue that a 1996 court case called into
question whether manufacturers could offer up-front discounts,
resulting in today's rebate-based system. I've heard differing opinions
as to whether the issues related to the initial court case are still
relevant. If the HHS proposed rule is finalized, can you assure the
committee that your company will offer up-front discounts? If not, why?
Answer. As the question notes, one of the practical implications of
the Proposed Rule is to incentivize a shift from back-end rebate
payments to up-front discounts that are passed through at the point-of-
service to the patient (at least in part). We understand that some in
the health care industry have raised concerns that the nation's
antitrust laws, specifically the Robinson-Patman Act, and long-running
antitrust litigation involving drug manufacturers, wholesalers, and
pharmacies could prevent or reduce discounting under a pricing
structure without rebates. But, the Robinson-Patman Act focuses on
price discrimination--involving any dimension of price--and it does not
distinguish between up-front discounts and rebates. In addition, the
referenced litigation, In re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust
Litigation, did not result in any change in the ability of a
prescription drug manufacturer to offer an up-front discount.
Consequently, because Sanofi's view is that the antitrust laws apply
equally to up-front discounts and back-end rebates, we do not believe
that they present any impediment to offering up-front discounts to
patients at the point of sale. Sanofi is committed to working with
other stakeholders to lower patient out-of-pocket costs, and the
company will carefully review any final rule issued by HHS regarding
the Anti-Kickback Statute and its safe harbor regulations--with the
goal of providing point-of-sale discounts to patients in a compliant
manner to help lower patient out-of-pocket costs.
Question. Please describe how you expect your company to respond to
the HHS proposed rule to eliminate safe harbor protection for back-end
rebates in Medicare Part D that is referenced above if it is finalized.
Assuming you are confident that antitrust laws do not prevent your
company from offering up-front discounts, specifically, do you envision
that your company lowers the list price of a drug to the current after-
rebate net price, offer discounts equal to the current rebate amount,
or a combination of both?
Answer. Sanofi is committed to working with other stakeholders to
lower patient out-of-pocket costs, and the company will carefully
review any final rule issued by HHS regarding the Anti-Kickback Statute
and its safe harbor regulations--with the goal of providing point-of-
sale discounts to patients in a compliant manner to help lower patient
out-of-pocket costs.
With respect to list price, if (1) the proposed changes to the
anti-kickback statute safe harbors were codified, and (2) Congress
implemented similar changes to the commercial insurance market, Sanofi
would lower the list prices of its prescription medications for
products in competitive categories for which there is currently a
material difference between list price and net price on the assumption
that patient access and affordability would be improved. Sanofi also
supports policy changes that would de-link other payments in the
pharmaceutical supply chain from list price.
We support extending the intent behind the anti-kickback statute
safe harbor proposed rule to the commercial market so that incentives
are aligned across the marketplace. Together, we believe these changes
would facilitate Sanofi's ability to lower our list prices. However, we
recommend a step-wise approach, implementing changes to the commercial
market after the safe harbor rule is implemented on January 1, 2020.
Such an approach would provide an opportunity for stakeholders and the
government to identify unintended consequences, and address them, prior
to extending these policies to the commercial market.
We want to ensure that the new system achieves its goal of
improving affordability for patients. For instance, CMS should monitor
and evaluate how the new system affects formulary access, utilization
management, and patient cost-sharing, particularly with respect to
medicines with a lower list price. We also have concerns that changes
to the rebate system may lead to new fees, which simply require
manufacturers to pay previous rebate values in new ways, rather than
creating savings for patients.
Without a better understanding of how these policy changes
ultimately would affect the competitive marketplace, patient access,
and affordability, we are unable to quantify the amount of up-front
discounts or any potential list price reduction.
Question. To what extent are the back-end rebates your company
currently offers contingent on the amount of market share realized for
your drugs as a result of Part D plan formulary placement and other
techniques?
Answer. Sanofi negotiates rebates with PBMs and Part D plans to
secure better formulary position for our products, which in turn
provides the best possible access and cost sharing for the majority of
Medicare Part D beneficiaries. When evaluating what level of rebates to
offer, Sanofi considers the potential business impact of such
arrangements.

\4\ The data used to derive this information is contracted sales data. Because many of these products are
purchased through non-contracted sales, Sanofi has a limited view regarding through which channels these
products are purchased. Percentage by volume by channel results in similar percentages to percentage by sales
so a separate chart is not provided.
Question. Do your companies hire consultants or lobbyists to
promote products at State Medicaid Pharmacy and Therapeutics
Committees? To whom do you disclose advocacy activities surrounding
State Medicaid programs, if at all?
Answer. Sanofi does not hire external consultants or lobbyists to
advocate for coverage of our products at State Medicaid Pharmacy and
Therapeutics Committees. Sanofi employees do attend State Medicaid
Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees meetings. Relevant advocacy
activities to support Medicaid access and coverage of our medicines, if
any, are disclosed to States in accordance with individual State laws.
Question. Please describe how the costs of patient assistance
programs are accounted for within your company's financial statements.
Please also describe the types of market information, such as
prescribing and use patterns, that your company collects from different
types of patient assistance programs and patient hub services.
Answer. Within Sanofi's financial statements, Sanofi includes the
administrative costs of the company's co-pay assistance programs, other
point-of-sale programs, and free drug patient assistance program
(Sanofi Patient Connection) in the ``Selling and general expenses''
line item. For co-pay assistance and other point-of-sale programs,
Sanofi records the pharmacy reimbursement amount paid by the company as
a reduction in sales. Sanofi records free product provided through
Sanofi Patient Connection within ``Cost of Sales.'' Sanofi Care North
America, the 501(c)(3) operating foundation that donates free product
to Sanofi Patient Connect, records the free goods as a ``Contribution''
when received from Sanofi and as a ``Donation'' when donated to Sanofi
Patient Connection.
With regard to market information associated with its patient
assistance programs and hub services, Sanofi generally collects data
that aids in the efficient administration and operation of these
programs. For example, the vendors operating Sanofi Patient Connection
and the hubs collect information provided by patients on enrollment
forms, including patient and provider demographic information, patient
insurance information, patient diagnosis, and prescription information
necessary to evaluate patient program eligibility and/or administer the
program. (Sanofi does not itself receive patient protected health
information except in very limited circumstances, such as when a
patient reaches out to Sanofi directly when they do not agree with
their patient assistance eligibility determination or when Sanofi
monitors vendor calls for compliance with company policies and
procedures.) With respect to Sanofi Patient Connection, Sanofi does not
use this information for purposes other than administering the patient
assistance program. With respect to hub services, in addition to using
this information to administer hub programs, Sanofi may use this data
to develop market and business insights.
With respect to Sanofi's point-of-sale patient assistance programs,
Sanofi also receives anonymized program utilization data, including
information about patient out-of-pocket costs, the average amounts that
Sanofi reimburses pharmacies through the program, abandonment rates,
dispensing pharmacies, and the prescribers writing the prescriptions
associated with program utilization. This information is used to
administer the program. Sanofi may also use this data to develop market
and business insights.
Question. Please provide a list of all contributions since January
1, 2014, that your company has made to any tax exempt organizations
working on issues related to drugs within your product lines, including
but not limited to patient groups, disease awareness groups, medical or
professional societies, universities or hospitals, industry
associations or leagues. For each contribution, please provide the name
of the organization that received the donation, the date the donation
was made, the amount of the donation, and a description of the purpose
of the contribution (i.e., was the contribution for the general fund, a
specific purpose to a specific program, or continuing medical
education). Please also note whether the contribution was unrestricted
or restricted; if it was restricted, please explain all restrictions.
Finally, if your company maintains a foundation or other separate
charitable arm, please provide the name of all such entities, and list
all donations made from that entity or entities.
Answer. In the attached documents, we have provided information for
the period January 1, 2015 through December 31, 2018 regarding payments
made by Sanofi US to tax-exempt organizations.\5\ The information is
provided in a number of documents consistent with how Sanofi maintains
this information. In some cases, this information may be over-inclusive
and include non-tax exempt organizations (e.g., contributions for
independent medical education into both non-profit and other entities).
The information includes contributions and sponsorships to various tax-
exempt health-care-oriented organizations, including patient groups.
The information also includes contributions made for independent
medical education grants, and to teaching hospitals for investigator-
sponsored trials and for physician fellowship payments. On March 8,
2018, Sanofi acquired Bioverativ, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company
focused on therapies for hemophilia and other rare blood disorders. The
attached documents also describe the monetary contributions to tax
exempt organizations made by Bioverativ since March 8, 2018.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ These contributions may not relate to particular drug products.
Sanofi US supports programs and initiatives of external, independent,
not-for-profit organizations that align with Sanofi US's corporate
vision and values. These organizations are generally healthcare-
oriented and focus on one or more therapeutic areas in which Sanofi US
is actively involved. The attached information focuses on Sanofi US
entities that manufacture and sell drug products and does not include
entities that manufacturer and sell consumer health products or
vaccines. Contribution information prior to 2015 is archived in
databases and systems that Sanofi does not currently maintain and which
are not easily accessible. The information available does not
distinguish between restricted and unrestricted grants.
With respect to any foundations or charitable arms of Sanofi, from
January 1, 2014 through the end of 2017, Sanofi maintained an entity
called Sanofi Foundation of North America, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
operating foundation that was closed at the end of 2017. Donations made
from that entity are included in the attachments described above.
Currently, Sanofi maintains an entity called Sanofi Cares North
America, which is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit operating foundation that makes
donations of Sanofi products free of charge to eligible financially-
needy uninsured and underinsured patients through a program known as
the Sanofi Patient Connection. Sanofi Cares North America also donates
product to five non-governmental organization partners for the purpose
of emergency disaster relief--Americares, DirectRelief, Heart to Heart
International, MAP International, and Project Hope, and to
approximately one hundred summer camps with 501(c)(3) status for

children with diabetes.
Question. Pay for delay agreements cost consumers and taxpayers
billions in higher drug costs every year. The FTC has gone after drug
companies that enter into these settlements where the brand pays the
generic company to keep its lower cost alternative off the market. I'm
the lead Republican sponsor of S. 64, the ``Preserve Access to
Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act,'' which would help put an end
to these deals.
Do you agree that these pay-off agreements keep drug costs high for
patients because they delay competition?
Answer. With respect to patent litigation, Sanofi believes it is
inappropriate to presume that any settlement of patent litigations
related to pharmaceutical products is anticompetitive. Patent
settlements are often the most efficient and effective way to resolve
disputes regarding patented drugs, and they often lead to the earliest
appropriate entry of generic products into the market, which benefits
patients. In fact, settlements permit entry of a generic alternative
into the market earlier than expiration of the relevant branded
product's patent. Each patent litigation and potential settlement
presents unique factors and must be considered individually and in
light of the relevant circumstances.
Question. Has your company ever entered into these kinds of
settlements with a generic company?
Answer. No, Sanofi does not enter into ``pay for delay'' or
``reverse payment'' agreements that prohibit generic drug or biosimilar
development after the expiration of a patent. Sanofi has reached
settlements in patent infringement cases, and these agreements have
allowed the generic company to commercialize its product before the
expiration of the branded product's patent(s).
Question. Do you support the pay for delay bill?
Answer. We support the intent behind this legislation to promote
competition, including prohibitions on ``reverse payment'' agreements.
However, we have significant concerns with the way that this bill is
drafted, and therefore we do not support this particular legislation.
We believe that it is inappropriate to make settlements of patent
litigations presumptively illegal or to classify such settlements as
anticompetitive. Such settlements can be the most efficient and
effective way to resolve legitimate disputes regarding patented drugs,
and they often lead to the earliest appropriate entry of generic
products into the market, which in turn benefits patients. As stated
above, each patent litigation and potential settlement presents unique
factors and must be considered individually and in light of the
relevant circumstances.
Additionally, we have concerns that this bill could apply
retroactively to agreements entered into after June 17, 2013. For
clarity and certainty in the marketplace, any new legislation governing
the settlement of patent litigation should apply prospectively only.
rebate traps/walls
Question. I'm increasingly concerned about the effect of so-called
``rebate traps'' or ``rebate walls'' on patients' access to quality,
lower cost medicine. I understand there is ongoing litigation
challenging these practices as anti-competitive.
Does your company engage in the bundling of rebates over multiple
products? If so, why? And what benefit does the consumer gain from
that?
Answer. Sanofi offers discounts in bundled sales arrangements only
in limited circumstances. For example, Sanofi may offer bundled
discounts on its products Toujeo' and Lantus' to
ensure that both products attain a formulary position that benefits
patients. This is especially important because the products may serve
patients with different medical needs.
Question. Does your company view these practices as anticompetitive
or harmful to patients' access to quality, lower cost medicine?
Answer. Sanofi prioritizes patient access to medications at a
reasonable cost. Sanofi's arrangements with individual PBMs or insurers
promote this goal by maintaining stability of supply at affordable
prices. In competitive drug markets, Sanofi may enter into arrangements
with particular PBMs or insurers that permit Sanofi to further reduce
its prices on one or more medications in exchange for greater certainty
regarding the amount of those medications it will sell over a specified
term. These arrangements promote patient access to quality, affordable
medications, are procompetitive, and comply with the antitrust laws.
Moreover, in competitive drug markets Sanofi's ability to ensure
patient access to affordable medications is affected both by PBMs and
insurers (who may have considerable negotiating leverage over
manufacturers) and by other manufacturers (who may respond to
competition from Sanofi in a variety of ways). While some manufacturers
may respond by building ``rebate walls'' or ``rebate traps'' around
their products, Sanofi shares the Committee's concern about practices
that are harmful to patients' access to quality, affordable medication.
Question. If a policy were adopted to eliminate rebates, or to
require that rebate savings be passed on to the consumer, would that in
and of itself solve the issue of rebate ``traps'' and ``walls''? And
would consumers benefit from such a policy?
Answer. The elimination of safe harbor protection for rebates would
remove incentives for manufacturers to attempt to influence formulary
placement through such discounts. It is also possible that competitive
products would be launched at lower list prices and more readily
incorporated into formularies on the basis of their clinical benefits
in a world without rebates. This would benefit the system overall,
including consumers.
drug pricing
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider regulatory costs or compliance? If so, how specifically do
those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at least
one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
Answer. The primary factors that Sanofi considers in setting list
price include the value of the product, the competitive environment,
patient affordability and access, investment in further product
development or needs to reinvest in R&D more generally. In certain
limited cases, Sanofi also will consider regulatory costs when setting
the list price of a product. These factors may be considered, for
example, where ongoing clinical trials are needed for a particular
therapy or when the FDA mandates a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategy (``REMS'') for a product--such as with Sanofi's drug
Lemtrada. Sanofi does not, however, consider our routine and ongoing
regulatory compliance efforts within the cost of our products. Rather,
those efforts are considered part of Sanofi's operating costs.
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider the risk of liability or litigation? If so, how specifically
do those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at
least one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
Answer. When conducting its pricing analysis for a new drug, Sanofi
does not specifically consider the risk of liability or litigation
associated with such product.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Pat Roberts
Question. What role do you see Value Based Arrangements (VBAs)
playing in the effort to reduce prescription drug costs? What potential
do these arrangements have to find the ``sweet spot'' between
controlling costs to patients and encouraging innovation of new drugs?
How can VBAs help lower what patients pay out-of-pocket?
Can Congress do more to allow for and encourage the use of VBAs?
Answer. Sanofi believes that encouraging an environment that is
supportive of value-based arrangements would help promote drug
affordability, increase patient access to medicines, and improve
patient adherence and outcomes. Although there are different types of
these agreements, value-based contracts generally tie prices and
payments to the value of a particular prescription drug product--while
potentially reducing patient out-of-pocket costs and providing patients
with better access to the most innovative drug products. A manufacturer
could, for example, condition payment for a product on its success in
meeting a predefined clinical outcome, and this type of arrangement
could make drugs more affordable and lower healthcare costs throughout
the system.
Facilitating value-based arrangements also could encourage new drug
innovation, control costs for such new products, and recognize the full
value of complex and personalized treatments. Nevertheless, despite the
promise of these arrangements, industry stakeholders--including
manufacturers and payers--need better legal and regulatory clarity. For
example, we support the creation of a safe harbor from Anti-Kickback
Statute liability to protect value-based agreements. We also are
supportive of any legislation that would facilitate value-based
arrangements and protect them from legal enforcement, such as the
Patient Affordability, Value, and Efficiency Act (PAVE Act).
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
Question. We continue to hear that rebates negotiated off of the
list price of a drug are both good and bad.
Pharmacy benefit managers and plans have argued that rebates are
used to lower premiums across the board and that it is the best way to
seek a price concession on otherwise expensive drugs.
Your industry argues that these payers are insisting on higher
rebates that can only be achieved by raising list prices.
But patients often lose under this system, with out of pocket costs
being tied to list price. Insulin patients appear to be routinely
impacted by this perversity in the system.
Please explain to the committee how your company would reduce list
prices if rebates were no longer a part of the equation?
What assurance can you provide that you would in fact lower your
prices?
What actions should be taken to ensure that patients are actually
seeing the benefits of lower out of pocket costs?
Answer. If (1) the proposed changes to the anti-kickback statute
safe harbors were codified, and (2) Congress implemented similar
changes to the commercial insurance market, Sanofi would lower the list
prices of its prescription medications for products in competitive
categories for which there is currently a material difference between
list price and net price on the assumption that patient access and
affordability would be improved. Sanofi also supports policy changes
that would de-link other payments in the pharmaceutical supply chain
from list price.
We support extending the intent behind the anti-kickback statute
safe harbor proposed rule to the commercial market so that incentives
are aligned across the marketplace. Together, we believe these changes
would facilitate Sanofi's ability to lower its list prices. However, we
recommend a step-wise approach, implementing changes to the commercial
market after the safe harbor rule is implemented on January 1, 2020.
Such an approach would provide an opportunity for stakeholders and the
government to identify unintended consequences, and address them, prior
to extending these policies to the commercial market.
We want to ensure that the new system achieves its goal of
improving affordability for patients. For instance, CMS should monitor
and evaluate how the new system affects formulary access, utilization
management, and patient cost-sharing, particularly with respect to
medicines with a lower list price. We also have concerns that changes
to the rebate system may lead to new fees, which simply require
manufacturers to pay previous rebate values in new ways, rather than
creating savings for patients.
Without a better understanding of how these policy changes
ultimately would affect the competitive marketplace, patient access,
and affordability, we are unable to quantify the amount of any
potential list price reduction.
With respect to actions that should be taken to ensure patients are
seeing the benefit of lower out-of-costs, we support legislation that
would incentivize manufacturers to lower list prices by connecting
better patient access and affordability to such pricing actions.
Question. If rebates are driving high list prices for drugs as drug
manufacturers' claim, why do you think that Part B drugs, which have no
PBM rebates, are also seeing significant price increases? Whose fault
is that?
Answer. Sanofi considers a variety of factors when setting or
raising its list prices. These factors include the value of the
product, the competitive environment, patient affordability and access,
investment in further product development or needs to reinvest in R&D
more generally. Within this framework, any list price increase is made
consistent with our pricing principles, including our commitment to
limit the total annual increase to a level at or below the NHE
projected growth rate, as estimated by CMS.
Although we agree that one factor in price increases across the
industry may be the increased demand for rebates at the PBM and health
plan level, that is not the only factor. In fact, Sanofi believes that
reducing incentives for high prices throughout the supply chain by
delinking payments from list price would have a meaningful impact on
price and patient costs. This is true, for example, with group
purchasing organizations (GPOs) that negotiate pricing for Part B
providers. As with PBMs, these GPOs negotiate rebates and
administrative fees that are linked to the list price of the product.
These structures thus create the same misalignment of interests as in
the PBM setting. It is important to note, as well, that the current
average sales price (ASP)-based system for Medicare Part B works to
moderate price growth because reimbursement reflects the weighted
average of discounts given to providers, payers, and other commercial
purchasers. This means that the Medicare program and its beneficiaries
benefit from the discounts health plans and providers negotiate on
these drugs. Due to this market-based competition, ASP reimbursement
rates often are substantially lower than list prices.
biosimilar competition/insulin
Question. Biosimilars have been much anticipated as a solution to
the drug pricing crisis. In particular, the FDA is moving to make
insulin a biologic that would be subject to biosimilar competition in
the future.
But we are hearing from all of you that the biosimilar market
doesn't work and the benefit of these cheaper but equally effective
alternatives are really not available to U.S. patients.
Can a biosimilar version of insulin be part of the solution for
diabetes patients?
If so, what changes need to be made to the system so that patients
and the taxpayer can realize the benefit of biosimilars? (Merck gave up
on pursuing a biosimilar to Sanofi's Lantus.) \6\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\6\ https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/merck-ditches-biosimilar-
lantus-but-will-ease-path-for-mylan-s-rival-insulin-product.
Answer. Sanofi believes that biosimilars currently--and will
continue to--result in increased competition. In fact, this type of
competition has grown among insulin manufacturers in recent years, and
we expect that it will continue to lower prices for patients with
diabetes. For example, in 2016, Eli Lilly introduced a follow-on
biologic to Sanofi's drug Lantus. Additionally, in 2018, Sanofi
introduced Admelog, a follow-on biologic of Humalog, at a list price
that was 15% lower than the reference product. Mylan also is developing
a second follow-on insulin glargine that references Lantus, and Sanofi
is developing a biosimilar insulin aspart, a rapid-acting insulin,
which we expect to introduce in 2021. Sanofi expects that the already
highly competitive diabetes drug market will become increasingly robust
over time--including with the anticipated introduction of
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
interchangeable biosimilar basal and rapid acting insulins.
There are changes already in place that will help patients and
taxpayers realize the benefit of biosimilars. Specifically, in March
2020, certain biologics that are currently regulated as drugs,
including long acting insulins, will be regulated as biologics and
therefore will be subject to the existing biosimilars pathway. We
expect the change in insulin regulation to spur the continued
development of substitutable or interchangeable insulin products, and
to increase competition in this space generally.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
re-evaluating business strategies in foreign countries
Question. Since taking office, President Trump has made reducing
drug prices one of his highest priorities--and has repeatedly spoken
about his frustration with the U.S. subsidizing the costs of
pharmaceuticals for the rest of the world. He has gone so far as to
issue proposals, like the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model, in
an attempt to bring down prescription drug prices.
With the increased scrutiny of the industry and of the drug supply
chain as a whole in the United States, have any of your companies re-
evaluated your business strategy in foreign countries? If not, then
why?
Answer. No, Sanofi has not reevaluated its business strategy in
foreign countries. Other countries have implemented systems, such as
price controls or reference price regimes, to directly and artificially
regulate the price of medicines. In our experience, there is not an
opportunity for Sanofi to negotiate prices with these foreign
government payers. Sanofi's only choice is to accept the government-
mandated price, or to not sell the pharmaceutical in that country,
which not only hurts a company financially, but more importantly harms
patients.
We note that, although these systems may be effective at
controlling budgets for central payers, they come at a steep cost for
patients, including severe access restrictions and rationing. For
instance, one analysis of the report released to justify the
International Pricing Index found that 96 percent of new cancer
medicines are available in the U.S. compared to 71 percent in the
United Kingdom and 65 percent in France.\7\

As a Sanofi specific example, Dupixent is the first drug to be
approved for moderate to severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in the US.
FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent as preliminary
clinical evidence indicated that ``the drug may demonstrate substantial
improvement over available therapy on clinically significant
endpoint(s).'' Dupixent was approved by FDA in March 2017 under
Priority Review, which means that FDA's goal is to take action on this
application within 6 months (compared to 10 months under standard
review). Within 24 hours of FDA approval, Sanofi shipped orders for
Dupixent to be made available to U.S. patients. In contrast, Health
Canada approved Dupixent in November 2017. However, Dupixent is still
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
not publicly reimbursed in Canada.
Question. If a proposal, like IPI, were implemented, would it force
your companies to potentially ``walk away from the negotiating table
when other countries demand low prices subsidized by America's
seniors,'' as HHS Senior Advisor for Drug Pricing Reform John O'Brien
has said?
Answer. In our experience, there is not an opportunity for
manufacturers to negotiate with a government. Sanofi's only choice is
to accept the government-mandated price, or to not sell the product in
that country, which, as noted above, not only hurts Sanofi financially,
but more importantly harms patients.
Question. What are some of your ideas on how we can ensure
Americans aren't shouldering the full cost of pharmaceuticals?
Answer. While we understand the concern that Americans are
shouldering more than their fair share of the cost of innovation in the
pharmaceutical sector, the list price discrepancy between the U.S. and
other countries is due, in primary part, to the different health care
systems. Because Sanofi pays significant rebates to payers and PBMs,
the difference between the price in other developed countries and the
net price in the U.S. is not nearly as large.
Sanofi's top priority is reducing out-of-pocket costs for patients.
We believe that there need to be reforms to the current system to
better align incentives, including market-based approaches to pricing
that promote competition and ensure patients have affordable and
sustainable access to innovative medicines. Currently, payers and PBMs
inconsistently pass through the growing savings that they receive from
increased negotiated rebates. Accordingly, despite increasing rebates
and lower net prices, out-of-pocket costs for many patients have
continued to grow. Sanofi supports policies that pass PBM and payer
rebate savings to patients at the pharmacy counter through lower copays
and coinsurance. Sanofi would also support policies that would
incentivize responsible pricing by tying smaller list price increases,
or even list price reductions, to both access and affordability for
patients.
foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
Question. President Trump and Secretary Azar have both repeatedly
described their frustrations with ``foreign freeloading'' of U.S. drugs
in the last year.
``When foreign governments extort unreasonably low prices from U.S.
drug makers, Americans have to pay more to subsidize the enormous cost
of research and development. . . . It's unfair and it's ridiculous, and
it's not going to happen any longer.''
Do you agree that because of foreign countries' pricing and
reimbursement systems, U.S. patients and innovators are shouldering the
burden for financing medical advances?
Answer. It is true that the U.S. is the main engine in
pharmaceutical and biotechnology innovation in the world. Although
U.S.-based manufacturers manage clinical trials globally, there are
substantially more research and development dollars invested in the
U.S. than in any other country. To illustrate, in 2015, PhRMA member
companies spent over $47 billion in domestic R&D and only $12 billion
in R&D abroad. For Sanofi, in 2018, we spent nearly $7 billion on R&D
globally--a substantial portion of which in the U.S.--and we expect
that our annual R&D spend will be consistent through 2021. These
investments in research, in turn, create significant and important job
opportunities in the United States.
However, it is important to note that while other countries'
pricing and reimbursement systems may help to contain costs in those
countries, they come at a steep cost for patients, including severe
access restrictions and rationing. For instance, one analysis of the
report released to justify the International Pricing Index found that
96 percent of new cancer medicines are available in the U.S. compared
to 71 percent in the United Kingdom and 65 percent in France.\8\
Moreover, the list price discrepancy between the U.S. and other
countries is due, in part, to the different health-care systems.
Because Sanofi pays significant rebates to payers and PBMs, the
difference between the price in other developed countries and the net
price in the U.S. is not nearly as large.

Question. How do foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
systems affect our prescription drug costs?
Answer. Pricing and reimbursement systems in other countries do not
affect how Sanofi prices its medicines in the United States. Consistent
with our pricing principles, when Sanofi sets the price of a new
medicine in the U.S., we hold ourselves to a rigorous and structured
process that includes consultation with external stakeholders. In our
view, an objective measure of a new product's value considers the
benefit to patients, compared to a standard of care; the reduced need--
and therefore costs--of other health-care interventions; and any
increase in quality of life and productivity. We believe our pricing
reflects these factors. We also consider factors such as the
affordability for patients and any unique factors specific to the
medicine, like the need to support ongoing clinical trials, implement
important regulatory commitments, or develop sophisticated patient
support tools that improve care management and help decrease the total
cost of care. Additionally, under our pricing principles, we have
pledged to limit price increases at or below the National Health
Expenditure (NHE), which is the projected annual health-care spending
growth rate as estimated by CMS.
Question. Are foreign governments taking note of the concerns being
raised by the Trump administration and have they responded in any way?
Answer. Sanofi is not aware of any responses by foreign governments
to U.S. drug pricing policy proposals advanced by the Trump
administration.
Question. Has there been any noticeable change in any of our trade
agreements since these concerns have been raised by the Trump
administration?
Answer. Sanofi is not aware of any such changes.
medicaid closed formulary proposals
Question. In an attempt to bring down drug costs, various States
have been exploring whether to exclude certain drugs from their
Medicaid program. For example, the State of Massachusetts recently
asked CMS for permission to create a closed formulary where the State
Medicaid program would pick at least one drug per therapeutic class.
CMS denied their waiver request citing violation of Federal law, but
this proposal does bring up important questions on how to contain drug
prices in State Medicaid programs.
If the principles of the Medicare Part D program--including the
necessary patient protections--were applied to State Medicaid programs,
do you think it would lower drugs costs while ensuring access to
patients?
Answer. The Part D program encourages strong competition in the
marketplace, including by providing beneficiaries with choice of
different plans and encouraging drug manufacturers to compete for
formulary position to support broad access to their medicines (in part
by securing lower cost-sharing obligations for patients in preferred
formulary tiers). By contrast, State Medicaid programs are obligated,
as a condition of a manufacturer's participation in the Medicaid Drug
Rebate Program, to cover company's products (subject to certain narrow
exceptions). Consequently, although we believe that increased
competition in the Medicaid program could help to lower drug prices,
including if Medicaid implemented certain of the Part D program's
principles, it is not immediately clear how these changes would further
enhance patient access.
medicaid ``best price''
Question. In the Trump administration's Blueprint, they suggested
that because drug manufactures have to give Medicaid the ``best price''
on drugs, there is no incentive to offer deeper discounts to other
payers--both government and commercial--than what is already offered
under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Does the Medicaid ``best price'' requirement encourage
manufacturers to increase initial prices?
Answer. The Medicaid Rebate Act, and CMS's corresponding rules,
require drug manufacturers to pay rebates to the State Medicaid
Programs for units of drug dispensed to their beneficiaries. Medicaid
``Best Price'' generally is defined as the lowest price offered to
commercial purchasers in the United States, and it is one of two key
metrics used for setting the level of rebates that manufacturers must
pay to each state Medicaid program for Medicaid beneficiary
utilization. Best Price does not, therefore, reflect a price point at
which manufacturers sell products to Medicaid, and Sanofi does not view
the Medicaid Best Price requirements as encouraging manufacturers to
set higher initial prices. However, Medicaid Best Price considerations
are a factor in assessing whether to offer higher rebate amounts to our
commercial (Best Price-eligible) customers.
Question. What, if any, changes would you suggest we make to the
program?
Answer. With regard to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and the
determination of Best Price, the Trump administration's Pricing
Blueprint highlights the impediments that exist under current rules
with regard to value-based discounting arrangements. Sanofi would like
to pursue more innovative product discounting strategies--including
arrangements in which we would stand behind the value or outcomes that
our products provide to patients and to the healthcare system
generally. But, current Medicaid rebate calculation rules regarding
bundled discount arrangements, and the manner in which manufacturers
must account for discounts that are incurred over long periods of time,
present significant obstacles to adopting these arrangements. If the
rules for the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program were amended to permit
manufacturers to exclude certain appropriately-structured value-based
discounts from their Best Price calculation, it is likely that Sanofi
could adopt more innovative value-based discount contracts, and that
these arrangements in turn could result in significant savings for
patients and the system.
outcomes-based contracts
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you highlight your
support of outcomes-based contracts and how we need to be shifting our
system toward that approach.
How will these contracts lower drug costs for patients in both the
near term and long-term?
How will they lower overall health-care costs for our Federal
programs?
What have the preliminary results looked like so far?
Answer. Sanofi believes that encouraging an environment that is
supportive of value-based arrangements would help promote drug
affordability, increase patient access to medicines, and improve
patient adherence and outcomes. Specifically, value-based arrangements
tie prices and payments to value while reducing patient out-of-pocket
costs and providing patients with better access to the most innovative
drug products. For example, value-based arrangements can be premised
upon the effectiveness of a manufacturer's product, which may help to
secure payer coverage for new and innovative therapies. Where payment
to a manufacturer is conditioned on the value or clinical outcomes of a
product, value-based arrangements also may help to improve patient
cost-sharing challenges. Additionally, value-based arrangements could
encourage new drug innovation while controlling costs for such new
products by aligning the price of the drug to the value the drug brings
to the patient.
Recently, Sanofi has executed value-based contracts related to
Soliqua 100/33, Praluent, and Kevzara. These arrangements are in their
nascent stages, and we do not have sufficient information to assess the
results.
Despite the promise of these and similar arrangements, Sanofi
strongly believes that better legal and regulatory clarity would
facilitate greater proliferation of value-based contracts. For example,
we support the creation of a safe harbor from Anti-Kickback Statute
liability to expressly protect value-based agreements. We also are
supportive of legislation that would remove Best Price-barriers to
value-based contracts, such as the Patient Affordability, Value, and
Efficiency Act (PAVE Act).
transparency/point of sale
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you express your
support for the Trump Administration's proposal to allow manufacturers
to provide PBMs up-front discounts that are passed onto patients at the
point-of-sale.
Do you feel like this proposal will make the transactions within
the drug supply chain more transparent?
If so, would this transparency bring down drug costs--overall and
for specialty drugs?
Answer. Because the proposed rule would require manufacturer
discounts to be provided at the pharmacy counter, the proposal will
facilitate increased transparency with respect to the arrangements
between manufacturers and PBMs, and with respect to the discounts
manufacturers offer on their medicines. We believe such increased
transparency would result in lower patient costs.
However, Sanofi believes that HHS's proposal does not go far enough
in creating the kind of systemic change needed to create a more
transparent drug supply chain throughout the entire U.S. health-care
system. We believe that increased, system-wide transparency, that
appropriately protects competitively sensitive information, would
improve competition by making relevant information available to
patients and policymakers. Providing more information about what is
driving costs in the system, and taking steps to curtail misaligned
incentives related to the flow of money through the system, for
instance through legislation like the C-THRU Act, would allow for
increased competition and better-informed decision making.
the relationship between wholesalers and manufacturers
Question. When talking about the pharmaceutical supply chain, a lot
of focus has been placed on the Pharmacy Benefit Manager. But there's
another side of the equation that I'd like to ask about.
How do wholesalers negotiate pricing with manufacturers?
What impact does this have on drug costs?
What incentives or disincentives do they have to contain price
increases?
Answer. Wholesalers do not typically negotiate pricing with
manufacturers. Wholesalers are merchant-middlemen in the supply chain,
and they generally facilitate the efficient distribution of drugs and
biologicals to end customers (such as pharmacies or clinics). While
Sanofi may offer a prompt pay discount to wholesalers, wholesalers
generally purchase product at Wholesale Acquisition Cost (i.e., list
price) and they facilitate the acquisition of products by end
purchases--frequently at prices that are negotiated between Sanofi and
the end purchaser. If wholesalers sell to end purchasers at a loss
based on the negotiated price, wholesalers will issue a ``chargeback''
to the manufacturer for the difference. In addition, Sanofi pays
service fees to wholesalers to operationalize this distribution and
chargeback process, and those fees typically are based on a percent of
WAC. As with fees paid to PBMs, Sanofi's view is that flat pricing for
wholesaler administrative services could exert downward pressure on
drug prices by delinking list price from fee payments.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
proposed rebate rule
Question. As has been done in many other settings, drug
manufacturers said during the hearing that one reason list prices for
drugs are high is that pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) demand
larger and larger rebates in order for the drug to receive favorable
placement on a formulary. You and your colleagues who testified during
the hearing stated if the administration's proposal on changes to the
anti-kickback safe harbor for pharmaceutical rebates took effect, your
company would likely lower list price.
Like many Oregonians, I am skeptical drug manufacturers would
voluntarily lower their prices. Therefore, would you support
legislation that would (1) make similar changes the administration has
put forward related to Part D and Medicaid managed care, (2) change the
rebate system in a similar way to the proposal for the commercial
market, and (3) require drug makers to lower the list price of their
drugs equal to the amount of rebates provided today?
Answer. If (1) the proposed changes to the anti-kickback statute
safe harbors were codified, and (2) Congress implemented similar
changes to the commercial insurance market, Sanofi would lower the list
prices of its prescription medications for products in competitive
categories for which there is currently a material difference between
list price and net price on the assumption that patient access and
affordability would be improved. Sanofi also supports policy changes
that would de-link other payments in the pharmaceutical supply chain
from list price.
We support extending the intent behind the anti-kickback statute
safe harbor proposed rule to the commercial market so that incentives
are aligned across the marketplace. Together, we believe these changes
would facilitate Sanofi's ability to lower our list prices. However, we
recommend a step-wise approach, implementing changes to the commercial
market after the safe harbor rule is implemented on January 1, 2020.
Such an approach would provide an opportunity for stakeholders and the
government to identify unintended consequences, and address them, prior
to extending these policies to the commercial market.
We want to ensure that the new system achieves its goal of
improving affordability for patients. For instance, CMS should monitor
and evaluate how the new system affects formulary access, utilization
management, and patient cost-sharing, particularly with respect to
medicines with a lower list price. We also have concerns that changes
to the rebate system may lead to new fees, which simply require
manufacturers to pay previous rebate values in new ways, rather than
creating savings for patients.
Without a better understanding of how these policy changes
ultimately would affect the competitive marketplace, patient access,
and affordability, we are unable to quantify the amount of any
potential list price reduction.
We support legislation that would incentivize manufacturers to
lower list prices by connecting better patient access and affordability
to such pricing actions. The U.S. market-based approach to drug pricing
has been successful in reducing net prices, but in the current system,
that value is not being passed on to patients. We expect that the
reforms we note above would address that issue while preserving a
market-based approach that promotes competition and ensures patients
have affordable and sustainable access to innovative medicines.
medicaid drug rebate program
Question. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) requires
manufacturers to provide a basic rebate and an additional inflationary
rebate for both brand and generic drugs. The inflationary rebate is an
increasingly substantial part of total rebates due in large part to
large increases in drug prices that exceed inflation. Under current
law, this inflationary rebate is capped at 100 percent of Average
Manufacturer Price (AMP). This is the case even when manufacturers
continue to raise their prices well above inflation.
Please provide a list of all of your pharmaceutical products that
have reached the Medicaid AMP rebate cap in any of the 20 quarters from
January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018.
For each drug listed in response to question 1, please also provide
a list of which quarters and years each drug hit the cap.
Answer. Sanofi takes steps to ensure that it complies with all
applicable laws related to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including
that it is paying rebates to the state Medicaid programs in accordance
with law. Sanofi sells NDCs in 29 product families for which it pays
Medicaid rebates at 100 percent of AMP. Respectfully, Sanofi's view is
that the detailed information requested by this question is
confidential and proprietary. We would be happy to work with the
Committee to provide this information in a way that mitigates against
competitive harms that could arise from public disclosure of this
information.
medicaid drug rebate program compliance
Question. I am concerned about recent reports and legal settlements
surrounding drug manufacturers' failure to comply fully with the
requirements of the MDRP. For example, an analysis by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General
found that between 2012 and 2016 taxpayers may have overpaid by as much
as $1.3 billion for 10 potentially misclassified drugs. That is why I
introduced the Right Rebate Act with Chairman Grassley to prevent drug
manufacturers from manipulating Medicaid to increase their profits.
However, I continued to be concerned about oversight and manufacturer
compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Accordingly, please describe the following:
Your company's current compliance plan and procedures used to
ensure compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program including internal audits or other checks you use to identify
compliance vulnerabilities.
Answer. Sanofi takes steps to ensure that it complies with all
applicable laws related to its participation in the Medicaid Drug
Rebate Program (MDRP). These steps include, for example, documenting
Medicaid rebate calculation methodologies, processes, and reasonable
assumptions as appropriate. Sanofi's government price reporting
personnel also hold weekly meetings with the Sanofi legal department,
including with support from outside counsel as needed, to ensure that
compliance questions are discussed and addressed in a timely manner.
Sanofi's MDRP compliance is tested through several audits, including
biannual Sarbanes-Oxley Act audits, biannual external audits,
conversations with an external consultant government pricing advisory
team, and annual calculation audits of Average Manufacturer Price and
Best Price.
Question. Any past or ongoing issues of non-compliance.
Answer. Given the complexity of the MDRP and applicable law and
guidance, Sanofi routinely reviews its calculation methodologies and
reasonable assumptions. In the normal course of business, questions may
arise as to specific Sanofi compliance processes for the MDRP. When
such questions arise, Sanofi takes prompt steps to engage with CMS
about appropriate next steps, including a restatement of any of the
components of the Medicaid rebate calculation if needed. Such
restatements are administrative in nature and expressly contemplated by
the CMS regulations.
Question. Any corrective actions taken to address identified
problems or issues of noncompliance with the MDRP and how such steps
were communicated to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.
Answer. As noted above, in the event that Sanofi identifies any
compliance questions that it believes warrant review by CMS, Sanofi
promptly engages with CMS. This may occur, for example, in the event of
statutory or regulatory changes, or if CMS releases new sub-regulatory
guidance.
Question. Any steps taken to improve compliance and ensure that all
Medicaid drug rebates owed to the federal government and the states are
paid in full.
Answer. Sanofi's government price reporting team routinely works
with in-house and outside counsel regarding compliance with the
Medicaid Drug Rebate Act and CMS rules. As part of this continuing
compliance, the company assesses its calculation processes and
reasonable assumptions for purposes of calculating Average Manufacturer
Price, Best Price, and Unit Rebate Amount. In certain cases, moreover,
Sanofi engages directly with CMS to seek the agency's view of Sanofi's
reasonable assumptions or compliance processes. In any instance in
which Sanofi would determine that the State Medicaid Programs were
underpaid rebates, Sanofi would engage with CMS to determine the
appropriate way forward, including restating pricing metrics and paying
additional rebates to the States.
bonus payments tied to specific drugs
Question. I am concerned by the potential for employee financial
incentives to encourage high launch prices and price increases for
prescription drugs.
Is your salary, bonus or other compensation tied to sales or
revenue targets of a single product your company sells? Has it ever
been? If yes, please state the product or products to which your
salary, bonus or other compensation was tied.
Is your salary, bonus or other compensation tied to either revenue
or net income of the company as a whole? Has it ever been? If yes,
please explain what assumptions about price increases are used when the
compensation committee sets revenue or net income goals. Does the
compensation committee provide any guidance to executives in regards to
the amount of revenue that the company will generate from price
increases versus volume growth?
Answer. The Sanofi board of directors, acting on the recommendation
of the Compensation Committee, sets the compensation for the chief
executive officer (CEO). That compensation structure includes fixed
compensation, variable compensation, options, performance shares, and
benefits in kind.
Sanofi's overall compensation policy is designed to motivate and
reward performance by ensuring that a significant portion of
compensation is contingent on the attainment of financial, operational,
and extra-financial criteria aligned with the corporate interest and
with the creation of shareholder value. Therefore, in 2017 (the most
current year in which public information is available), as Sanofi's
CEO, Dr. Brandicourt was eligible for up to 250 percent of his target
fixed compensation in variable compensation. Several factors are
considered in determining his variable compensation; 40 percent is
based on financial indicators, and 60 percent is based on specific
individual objectives, including external growth, product launches,
operational transformation, organization and staff relations, and new
product pipeline.
Dr. Brandicourt's compensation package also includes equity-based
compensation, which is medium-term and aims to align the interests of
the CEO with those of the shareholders and other stakeholders. In 2017,
he received a set number of options to subscribe for shares, based on
performance conditions measured over a 3-year period, as well as
performance shares based on business net income, return on assets, and
total shareholder return.
net prices
Question. In your testimony, you stated, ``we have increased
transparency by providing, each year, information about our list and
net prices across all of our medicines,'' and that ``in 2018, the
average aggregate list price increase across all Sanofi medicines in
the U.S. was 4.6 percent . . . the price actually paid to Sanofi,
declined by 8 percent. So declining average aggregate net price in
[2018] represents the third consecutive year in which the amount paid
by payers across all of our medicines went down.'' Please describe how
the company's year-over-year aggregate net price is calculated. Please
also specifically address the following questions.
Answer. Sanofi calculates the aggregate net price as follows: Brand
net sales are divided by common units for the appropriate period. This
amount--``net price per unit''--is then compared to the prior period.
This amount establishes any increase or decrease for the brand for the
period being calculated. Once this is done for all brands, the
increase/decrease is weighted by gross sales (i.e., volume) to show the
aggregate net price impacts for Sanofi's portfolio of medicines.
Question. How many products are included in the calculation of the
average net price change? What was the median net price change?
Answer. This analysis is done on 79 separate products, covering 76
brands. Some brands have multiple product forms with different prices;
Sanofi separates these product forms when calculating average net
price.
The median net price change in 2018 was zero percent across all
products. Removing products with no net price change, the median net
price change in 2018 is -1.0%. This calculation is not weighted by
gross sales.
Question. Is net price weighted? If so, how? For example, in
determining the aggregate net price does the company assign different
weights to different products based on volume or other factors? Are
``on patent'' and ``off patent'' drugs weighted identically? Are other
statistical weights used or are all products treated equally?
Answer. All products are weighted by gross sales (i.e., volume),
irrespective of whether Sanofi has any current patents related to the
product. No other statistical weights were used.
Question. Does the figure that you provided during your testimony
account for U.S. prices, international prices, or both? Generally
speaking, when your company reports net price changes, does it
differentiate between U.S. and international prices?
Answer. The data Dr. Brandicourt provided regarding average
aggregate list price and average aggregate net price accounted for U.S.
prices. Sanofi's annual pricing report \9\ and related reporting on net
price consider U.S. prices only.

Question. In its most recent pricing report, Sanofi states that it
``increased the price of 35 of our 76 prescription medicines'' in the
United States. This statement appears to be in regards to list price.
How many of these medicines had their net price increase?
Answer. Seventeen of the 35 prescription medicines with list price
increases also had average net price increases.
Question. In its most recent pricing report, Sanofi states that
``in 2018, 55 percent of our gross sales were given back to payers as
rebates, including $4.5 billion in mandatory rebates to government
payers and $7.3 billion in discretionary rebates.'' For each product,
please disclose the gross sales and the amount of rebates paid.
Answer. Product-level rebate information is confidential and
proprietary information for competitive reasons and falls within the
definition of ``trade secret'' under the Trade Secrets Act, 18 U.S.C.
Sec. 1905, Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C.
Sec. 552(b)(4), and the Defend Trade Secrets Act of 2016, 18 U.S.C.
Sec. 1836. Public disclosure of this information would cause
significant harm to Sanofi and Sanofi's customers, and competitors
would gain unfair competitive advantage if they were to obtain this
information through public disclosure.
We note that congressional and executive agencies have historically
expressed concern that disclosure of such information could inhibit
competition. For example, in 2007 when then-chairman Waxman asked
several Medicare Part D prescription drug plans (``PDPs'') to submit to
the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee information on the
negotiated price discounts, rebates and other price concessions that
they obtained from drug manufacturers, the CBO issued a report
concluding that public disclosure of that information could reduce the
rebates that PDPs received and thus raise Medicare costs.\19\
Specifically, the CBO found that the disclosure of rebate data could
cause the variation in rebates among purchasers to decline. Because
PDPs generally secure rebates that are somewhat larger than the average
rebates observed in commercial health plans, the disclosure of Part D
rebates to competitors could create pressure to reduce those rebate
amounts, which in turn could increase costs for the Medicare program
and, on average, the costs for Medicare beneficiaries.\20\
Specifically, the CBO found that the disclosure of rebate data could
cause the variation in rebates among purchasers to decline. Second, CBO
concluded that disclosure of rebates could facilitate tacit collusion
among the manufacturers of competing brand-name drugs, reducing the
rebates to PDPs and thus increasing net drug prices.\21\ Similarly, the
Federal Trade Commission (``FTC'') has cited concerns regarding the
anti-competitive effects of disclosing net pricing and other price-
sensitive information. In the context of the healthcare industry
generally, the FTC noted:

[Price transparency] can actually harm competition and
consumers. Some types of information are not particularly
useful to consumers, but are of great interest to competitors.
We are especially concerned when information disclosures allow
competitors to figure out what their rivals are charging, which
dampens each competitor's incentive to offer a low price, or
increases the likelihood that they can coordinate on higher
prices.\22\

Moreover, in describing its concerns about a New York state bill

disclose their rebate arrangements with drug manufacturers, the FTC
explained that disclosure of this information could ``facilitate
collusion, raise prices, and harm the patients the Bill is supposed to
protect.'' \23\ The FTC further explained that, without knowledge of
such competitor rebate information:

Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez
Question. When new products enter the market, do drug companies set
high initial prices and then provide deep rebates in order to gain
access to insurance plan's formularies?
Answer. We can only speak for Sanofi. Consistent with our pricing
principles, when Sanofi sets the price of a new medicine, we hold
ourselves to a transparent, rigorous, and structured process that
includes consultation with external stakeholders. In our view, an
objective measure of a new product's value considers the benefit to
patients, compared to a standard of care; the reduced need--and
therefore costs--of other health care interventions; and any increase
in quality of life and productivity. We believe our pricing reflects
these factors. We also consider factors such as the affordability for
patients and any unique factors specific to the medicine, like the need
to support ongoing clinical trials, implement important regulatory
commitments, or develop sophisticated patient support tools that
improve care management and help decrease the total cost of care.
Additionally, under our pricing principles, we limit annual list price
increases to the National Health Expenditure, which is CMS's projected
annual health-care spending growth rate. Since we established our
pricing principles in 2017, all price increases for our insulin
products have been at or below NHE.
Sanofi offers rebates to health plans and PBMs in order to help
secure and maintain favorable formulary positions. Our aim in these
negotiations is to establish affordable access to patients. Currently,
however, payers and PBMs inconsistently pass through to patients the
growing savings they receive from increased negotiated rebates and
discounts. Accordingly, despite increasing rebates and lower net
prices, out-of-pocket costs for many patients have continued to grow.
Sanofi supports policies that would pass through PBM rebate savings to
patients at the pharmacy counter in the form of lower cost-sharing.
Question. If CMS finalizes the rebate rule, do you anticipate
future products entering the market with significantly lower initial
list prices?
Answer. We can only speak for Sanofi. If (1) the proposed changes
to the anti-kickback statute safe harbors were codified, and (2)
Congress implemented similar changes to the commercial insurance
market, Sanofi would lower the list prices of its prescription
medications for products in competitive categories for which there is
currently a material difference between list price and net price on the
assumption that patient access and affordability would be improved.
Sanofi also supports policy changes that would de-link other payments
in the pharmaceutical supply chain from list price.
We support extending the intent behind the anti-kickback statute
safe harbor proposed rule to the commercial market so that incentives
are aligned across the marketplace. Together, we believe these changes
would facilitate Sanofi's ability to lower our list prices. However, we
recommend a step-wise approach, implementing changes to the commercial
market after the safe harbor rule is implemented on January 1, 2020.
Such an approach would provide an opportunity for stakeholders and the
government to identify unintended consequences, and address them, prior
to extending these policies to the commercial market.
We want to ensure that the new system achieves its goal of
improving affordability for patients. For instance, CMS should monitor
and evaluate how the new system affects formulary access, utilization
management, and patient cost-sharing, particularly with respect to
medicines with a lower list price. We also have concerns that changes
to the rebate system may lead to new fees, which would simply require
manufacturers to pay previous rebate values in new ways, rather than
creating savings for patients.
Without a better understanding of how these policy changes
ultimately would affect the competitive marketplace, patient access,
and affordability, we are unable to quantify the amount of any
potential list price reduction. When setting the price of a new
medicine, Sanofi's decision making will continue to be guided by our
pricing principles framework, which are discussed in Part 1 of this
response.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Thomas R. Carper
Question. What are your recommendations for lowering prices for the
40 percent of drugs that do not offer rebates in Medicare Part D? In
the health insurance plans that you offer your employees, do you ask
your insurers to pass through the full manufacturer rebates to the
beneficiaries?
Answer. To address prices of drugs that are not subject to rebates
in Medicare Part D, Sanofi supports policies that would incentivize
responsible pricing by tying smaller list price increases, or even list
price reductions, to both access and affordability for patients. Sanofi
also believes that value-based discounting arrangements could drive
down the price of prescription drugs in all contexts, regardless of the
existence of rebates, including for Medicare Part D. Sanofi favors
reforms in applicable statutes and regulations to permit manufacturers
and payers to adopt these arrangements more broadly than is the case
today.
The Sanofi medical plan is self-insured; as such, the company pays
the majority (approximately 80 percent) of the health-care claims that
are incurred by our employees and their dependents. Sanofi does not,
therefore, pass rebates through to members. Importantly, the Sanofi PPO
medical/Rx plan, which covers 90 percent of our employees who elect
medical coverage, maintains very low member cost-sharing for
prescriptions. For example, members incur no cost ($0 co-pays) for
Sanofi and partner prescription drugs. For non-Sanofi prescriptions,
the out-ofpocket expense varies for generic ($15/prescription),
preferred brand ($25/prescription) and non-
preferred brand ($40/prescription).
Question. The systems for pricing and distributing drugs are opaque
and difficult to understand. What are your recommendations for
increasing transparency in how your companies set the list prices for
drugs, and for improving transparency in the supply chain for
prescription drugs? Would you support federal standards for
transparency in setting the list prices for drugs?
Answer. Sanofi supports increased system-wide transparency, which
would improve competition by making relevant information available to
patients and policymakers. Two years ago, Sanofi announced our
progressive and industry-leading pricing principles to help
stakeholders understand our pricing decisions and to advance a more
informed discussion of issues related to the pricing of medicines.\25\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

principles-for-the-u-s/.
Sanofi's pricing policy includes a commitment to transparency in
how we price new medicines coming to the market for the first time.
When Sanofi sets the price of a new medicine, we hold ourselves to a
transparent, rigorous, and structured process that includes
consultation with external stakeholders. In our view, an objective
measure of a new product's value considers the benefit to patients,
compared to a standard of care; the reduced need--and therefore costs--
of other health care interventions; and any increase in quality of life
and productivity. We believe our pricing reflects these factors. We
also consider factors such as the affordability for patients and any
unique factors specific to the medicine, like the need to support
ongoing clinical trials, implement important regulatory commitments, or
develop sophisticated patient support tools that improve care

management and help decrease the total cost of care.
Tied to our pledge to keep annual list price increases at or below
the projected U.S. National Health Expenditure growth rate, Sanofi has
committed to providing its rationale should Sanofi increase any list
price above the NHE growth rate, highlighting clinical value, real
world evidence, regulatory change, new data, or other circumstances
that support our decision. Sanofi also has committed to disclose
annually our aggregate U.S. gross and net price changes from the prior
calendar year. These data may help illustrate how pricing changes
accrue to manufacturers versus others in the value chain, highlighting
our discrete role in the broader U.S. health care system.
We support Federal standards for transparency in the rationale for
price increases above a certain threshold, provided that there are
appropriate guardrails. Sanofi believes that increased transparency
should accomplish three goals:
(1)
Preempt similar state laws, as was done with the Sunshine
Act, to create a consistent reporting process.
(2)
Ensure information that if released publically could be
anti-competitive is kept confidential.
(3)
Take a holistic approach to transparency, such as
requiring PBMs to disclose when the net price of a medicine has
declined and whether the increased rebates are used to lower
costs for patients or for other reasons.
We would be willing to work with this Committee on appropriate
policy solutions.
Question. In nearly every sector of the health-care industry,
Medicare, Medicaid, employers, and insurers are moving away from fee-
for-service payments to reimbursements based on value and performance.
Prescription drugs and medical devices were the glaring exceptions to
this trend until recently. How many of your drugs are included in
value-based contracts and how many patients are benefiting from them?
How do these value-based contracts work to lower drug prices for both
patients and taxpayers?
Answer. At this time, Sanofi has entered into value-based
arrangements involving three Sanofi products: Soliqua 100/33, Praluent,
and Kevzara. At present, we are not able to identify the specific
number of patients who benefit from these arrangements.
Sanofi believes that encouraging an environment that is supportive
of value-based arrangements would help promote drug affordability,
increase patient access to medicines, and improve patient adherence and
outcomes. Specifically, although there are different types of these
agreements, value-based contracts generally tie prices and payments to
the value of a particular prescription drug product--while potentially
reducing patient out-of-pocket costs and providing patients with better
access to the most innovative drug products. A manufacturer could, for
example, condition payment for a product on its success in meeting a
predefined clinical outcome, and this type of arrangement could make
drugs more affordable and lower costs throughout the system.
Question. Last year, Senator Portman and I did an investigation on
the pricing of an opioid overdose reversal drug called EVZIO,
manufactured by Kaleo. Kaleo increased the price of EVZIO from $575 in
2014 to $4,100 in 2017. We found that the best price Medicare was able
to get for EVZIO, about $4,000, was much higher than the price other
Federal programs and private insurers were able to get. It seemed that
Kaleo was able to get this higher price of $4,000 from Medicare by
helping doctors fill out paperwork showing that the drug was medically
necessary, even though there are cheaper alternatives on the market. As
a result of the investigation, Kaleo announced it will bring a generic
version of the drug to market at only $168 per pack. Are any of your
companies providing medical necessity paperwork to doctors in order to
get your drugs covered by Medicare?
Answer. No. Sanofi does not provide patient-specific clinical or
medical necessity information to physicians in furtherance of the
Medicare coverage of any of Sanofi's products for particular patients.
Consistent with guidance from the Department of Health and Human
Services Office of Inspector General (OIG), Sanofi typically provides
physicians with a copy of an applicable blank prior authorization form,
or in some cases, the form with only the physician's demographic
information filled out, along with separate instructions for filling
out the form. Also, in keeping with OIG guidance, Sanofi provides
physicians with template appeals letter for instances in which a
physician needs to appeal non-coverage for a Sanofi product. These
template letters do not include any patient medical information, and
instead are provided only as a guide for physicians to describe the
reasons that the patient requires his or her prescribed Sanofi
product.\26\ Similarly, Sanofi provides physicians with template
letters of medical necessity, which do not offer medical information on
specific patients. Instead, these documents provide a general framework
pursuant to which physicians may prepare their own, patient-specific
letters of medical necessity.\27\ These measures comply with the OIG
guidance in that they provide ``limited support'' in connection with a
purchase or prescribing decision for a Sanofi product.

Question. In 2017, the Rand Corporation estimated that biosimilar
drugs, which are competitors to complex, biologic drugs, could save the
United States more than $50 billion over the next decade. Some of you
have also argued that increasing the use of biosimilar drugs would help
lower drugs costs for consumers and taxpayers. What is delaying the
uptake of biosimilar drugs in the United States? What policies do you
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
recommend to increase the development of biosimilar drugs?
Answer. Sanofi supports the entry of biosimilar medicines in the
market after a reasonable period of time after the innovator biologic
is developed, which we believe is already reflected in U.S. law. There
are changes already in place that will help patients and taxpayers
realize the benefit of biosimilars. Specifically, in March 2020,
certain biologics that are currently regulated as drugs, including long
acting insulins, will be regulated as biologics and therefore will be
subject to the existing biosimilars pathway. We expect the change in
regulation to spur the continued development of substitutable or
interchangeable products, and to increase competition in this space
generally. Further, we believe that as health-care providers become
more familiar with biosimilars, the uptake of biosimilar drugs will
increase. Findings from a recent review show that there is an overall
lack of biosimilar familiarity among U.S. and European health-care
providers, leading to low prescribing comfort as well as safety and
efficacy concerns.\28\ The study concludes that, to realize the full
cost-saving potential of biosimilar medicines, clinician-directed
biosimilar education is necessary to address the gaps in biosimilar
knowledge, facilitate prescribing changes, and ultimately increase
biosimilar use.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
Question. The United States is one of the only countries in the
world to allow prescription drug manufacturers to advertise directly to
consumers through magazines, billboards, radio, and television
commercials. While I will not argue that it is beneficial to educate
consumers about an unfamiliar disease and encourage them to seek
medical help, most commercials from all of your companies recommend
asking about a specific brand name drug, not a medical condition.
Furthermore, even if your advertisements follow all FDA rules and list
medication side effects, they also almost always list these while a
smiling, apparently healthy person is walking on a beach.
Researchers say that this type of imagery, combined with viewing
hours of drug commercials each month, leads consumers to underestimate
the risks associated with medications. For the past decade, studies
have shown that aggressive direct-toconsumer advertising is associated
with rising drug prices and an increase in inappropriate drug
prescriptions.
Since researchers have concluded that consumers are
misunderstanding the benefits and risks described in your ads, what
further policies could help you and your colleagues ensure that you are
educating patients in a clear manner?
Answer. Sanofi believes DTC advertisements can play an important
role in both raising awareness about a disease and educating patients
about their treatment options. The benefits of DTC advertisements are
reflected in the results of a recent survey conducted by Princeton
Survey Research Associates International, which found that DTC
advertisements often prompt conversations about alternatives such as
generics or lifestyle changes, and prompt positive behaviors, such as
information-seeking and medicine adherence.\29\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\29\ https://www.phrma.org/report/2017-direct-to-consumer-
advertising-survey-results.
When DTC advertisements solely discuss a particular disease or
condition without mentioning or alluding to a specific drug, FDA
considers the advertisements disease awareness communications. Disease
awareness communications are not considered promotional labeling or
advertising, and thus such communications are not subject to the
requirements of the Federal, Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) or FDA
regulations. In contrast, DTC advertisements that make claims about a
drug are subject to requirements governing disclosure of risk and other
information, including a statutory requirement to include a brief
summary relating to side effects, contraindications, and effectiveness.
FDA's prescription drug advertising regulations distinguish between
print and broadcast advertisements, which require a ``brief summary''
for print advertisements and what is referred to as a ``major
statement'' of risks for broadcast advertisements. FDA regulations also
set forth additional requirements for information to be included in
both print and broadcast advertisements. Certain broadcast
advertisements, including the initial television advertisement for a
prescription drug and all television advertisements for prescription
drugs subject to a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy with elements to
assure safe use, are subject to pre-dissemination review by FDA. Even
where a television advertisement is not subject to mandatory review,
sponsors may elect to voluntarily submit the advertisement to FDA for
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
advisory review.
While the time-limited nature of broadcast DTC advertisements can
present challenges in ensuring a drug advertisement presents all
information required by the FDCA and FDA regulations in a manner easily
digestible to a consumer, or even HCP, audience, Sanofi strives to
disseminate balanced DTC advertisements that clearly and effectively
communicate a product's benefits and risks. To that end, prior to
airing any DTC television advertisement, Sanofi submits each
advertisement to FDA for pre-dissemination review and incorporates
FDA's comments, even when such review is not required for the
advertisement in question. To further the objective of ensuring that
DTC advertisements educate consumers about potential treatment options
in a non-misleading manner, we believe industry would benefit from a
regulatory framework that allows for greater flexibility in the risk
and other information required to be included in broadcast
advertisements, including, for example, the flexibility to focus on
select significant risks in the advertisement itself while directing
consumers to a website for a more fulsome discussion of a product's
risks. FDA has acknowledged that its regulations provide ``only limited
flexibility'' for risk disclosure in broadcast advertisements. Thus,
allowing for greater flexibility in content control in DTC
advertisements would likely require amending existing FDA regulations,
as well as potentially the underlying statutory provisions governing
the information required to be disclosed in advertisements.
pharmaceutical companies continue to raise prices
Question. As you are well aware, high prescription drug prices are
the number one concern for Americans and their families. According to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average
American spends around $1,208 annually on prescription drugs. There
have been several instances where brand name or even generic drugs that
have been on the market for years continue to increase in price.
One of the most well-known examples is Mylan's increase of the
price of EpiPen from less than $100 in 2007 to more than $600 in 2016.
Another example, is the ever-increasing price of insulin. Sanofi
increased the price of a vial of Lantus from $88.20 in 2007 to $307.20
in 2017. And those are just a small sample of price increases.
Why don't we see price decreases for drugs that have been on the
market for years without new formulations or added benefit?
Answer. Current regulations, including price reporting
requirements, create uncertainty about the implications of lowering a
list price. We are working with CMS on alternatives that could enable
us to put lower list price versions of our products on the market.
Until such system changes are implemented, we are working to improve
the affordability of our products for those who are uninsured or
underinsured through our many patient support programs.
It is important to note, as well, that revenues from existing
therapies are used to fund future R&D across therapeutic areas.
Sanofi's R&D strategy is to allocate resources to priority therapeutic
areas based both on scientific opportunity and unmet medical need,
leveraging multiple therapeutic modalities and accelerating early
development. Our R&D pipeline currently contains 81 projects, including
33 new molecular entities in clinical development, and 35 projects are
in Phase III or have been submitted to regulatory authorities. From
2008 to 2017, Sanofi invested over $55 billion dollars globally in R&D.
Last year we invested almost $7 billion globally, or approximately 24%
of our gross profits, in our research and development activities. We
expect to continue to spend around the same on R&D in the coming years.
pay for delay
Question. Pay for delay is a tactic that more and more branded drug
manufacturers have been using to stifle competition from lower-cost
generic manufacturers. This allows you to sidestep competition by
offering patent settlements that pay generic companies not to bring
lower-cost alternatives to market.
These ``pay-for-delay'' patent settlements benefit both brand-name
pharmaceutical companies by helping them avoid costly patent litigation
and general manufacturers by rewarding them a hefty sum to delay
entering the market with a cheaper drug alternative. However, these
deals do not benefit consumers. According to an FTC study, these
anticompetitive deals cost consumers and taxpayers $3.5 billion in
higher drug costs every year.
Does your company partake in pay-for-delay settlements?
Answer. No, Sanofi does not enter into ``pay for delay'' agreements
that prohibit generic drug or biosimilar development after the
expiration of a patent. Sanofi has reached settlements in patent
infringement cases, and these agreements have allowed the generic
company to commercialize its product before the expiration of the
applicable patent covering Sanofi's innovator product.
Question. Why would a pharmaceutical company enter into a pay-for
delay agreement?
Answer. We can only speak for Sanofi, and we do not enter into
``pay-for-delay'' settlement agreements.
Question. Do you think these agreements stifle competition and
prevent generic alternatives to your branded medications?
Answer. With respect to patent litigation, generally, Sanofi
believes it is inappropriate to presume that any settlement of patent
litigations related to pharmaceutical products is anticompetitive. Such
settlements are often the most efficient and effective way to resolve
disputes regarding patented drugs. Additionally, they often lead to the
earliest appropriate entry of generic products into the market thereby
benefiting patients--earlier than expiration of the relevant patents.
Each patent litigation and potential settlement presents unique factors
and must be considered individually and in light of the relevant
circumstances.
drug rebate rule
Question. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services'
(HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) promulgated a new regulation to
remove regulatory safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback
Statute (AKS) for rebates on prescription drugs rebates paid by
manufactures to PBMs under Medicare Part D and for Medicaid managed
care organizations (MCOs). The OIG proposal attempts to ban most
rebates by eliminating their regulatory protections.
The rule is predicted to increase net drug costs in its early
years. The CMS actuaries estimate it would cost $196 billion over 10
years. Despite this high price tag, the beneficiary benefits are
limited. The proposed rule notes that under the CMS Actuary's analysis,
the majority of beneficiaries would see an increase in their total out-
of-pocket payments and premium costs; reductions in total cost sharing
will exceed total premium increases.
I wanted to ask a question about the administration's rebate rule,
which I understand that many of the drug manufacturers, and your main
trade association, strongly support. According to an analysis of the
rule by the Office of Actuaries at CMS, drug manufacturers are likely
to initially retain 15 percent of the current rebates as higher net
drug prices.
Given that estimate, can you provide the committee with any
assurances that prices will not increase under this proposed rule?
Answer. At this time, it is difficult to predict the effect of the
administration's proposed rule. It is our expectation that it will
result in lower out-of-pocket costs for patients by protecting only
manufacturer rebates to Medicare Part D and Medicaid MCO plans and
their PBMs that are reflected in the point-of-sale price. Without a
better understanding of how these policy changes ultimately would
affect the competitive marketplace, patient access, and affordability,
however, we are unable to provide assurances regarding how prices might
change.
We want to ensure that the new system achieves its goal of
improving affordability for patients. For instance, CMS should monitor
and evaluate how the new system affects formulary access, utilization
management, and patient cost-sharing, particularly with respect to
medicines with a lower list price. We also have concerns that changes
to the rebate system may lead to new fees, which simply require
manufacturers to pay previous rebate values in new ways, rather than
creating savings for patients.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
Question. According to an article recently published in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, medical marketers spent nearly $30
billion dollars in 2016, up from $17 billion in 1997. Direct-to-
Consumer (DTC) advertising had the biggest percentage increase: from
$2.1 billion, or 11.9% of all medical marketing, in 1997 to $9.6
billion, or 32% of total spending, in 2016.
Can each of you please provide what your ratio of spending on sales
and marketing to research and development is today?
Answer. In 2018, Sanofi's global ratio of spending on sales and
marketing \30\ to research and development was approximately 117
percent.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\30\ ``Sales and marketing'' includes, but is not limited to: sales
force, promotion, and marketing management.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
price-gouging
Question. Sanofi, as I understand it, has made a pledge to the
public to limit its price increases to the national health expenditures
growth projection.
As the chair of the board of directors at PhRMA would you support
membership requirements that would cap annual price increases for drugs
sold as part of Medicare, similar to what Sanofi has pledged?
Given that PhRMA members are considering creating higher standards
for themselves, would you support an industry-wide standard on annual
price increases that applies to all pharmaceutical corporations,
whether or not they are members of PhRMA?
Answer. Dr. Brandicourt appeared before the committee on behalf of
Sanofi; we cannot speak on behalf of PhRMA or any other company. We
note that pricing discussions among PhRMA members, or pharmaceutical
manufacturers more generally, could implicate federal antitrust laws
and therefore would be inappropriate.
Two years ago, Sanofi announced our progressive and industry-
leading pricing principles, which include a pledge to keep annual list
price increases at or below the projected U.S. National Health
Expenditure (NHE) growth rate, as calculated by CMS. In 2018, all of
Sanofi's price increases across its medicines were consistent with
those pricing principles, as are all pricing actions taken in 2019.
Question. What policies would you propose to help ensure lower
launch prices for new drugs?
Answer. For Sanofi, the key requirement for any policy solution is
that it should result in improved access and lower prescription out-of-
pocket drug costs for patients, while maintaining incentives for
innovations. To reform the current misaligned incentives in the current
system, Sanofi supports de-linking payments to PBMs, payers and others
in the supply chain from the list price. Additionally, we support
policies that would incentivize lower launch prices, smaller list price
increases, or even list price reductions, by requiring health plans to
cover those medicines at an affordable co-pay level and only allow
access restrictions consistent with the label and accepted best
clinical practice.
transparency
Question. In many of your testimonies, you mentioned that the
current system of pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) back-end rebates do
not rarely results in a scenario where the PBM passes on savings to
consumers at the point of sale (POS). The Administration recently
proposed a rule to eliminate the anti-kickback statute safe harbor
protections for these drug rebates.
Do you agree that greater transparency should be required to
understand how manufacturers and PBMs are negotiating prices and
rebates to ensure that savings are passed down to beneficiaries?
Answer. Yes. Sanofi supports policies, such as those proposed in
the C-THRU Act, that would encourage or require PBMs and payers to be
transparent regarding how they use manufacturer rebates and pass
through manufacturer rebates to patient at point of sale in the form of
lower out-of-pocket costs.
As part of our pricing principles, Sanofi voluntarily discloses
annually our aggregate U.S. gross and net price changes from the prior
calendar year. These data help illustrate how pricing changes accrue to
manufacturers versus others in the value chain, highlighting our
discrete role in the broader U.S. health care system.
pbms
Question. An Axios article from March 7, 2019 highlights the fact
that, while ``pharmaceutical companies put a lot of the blame for high
drug prices on pharmacy benefit managers,'' many large pharmaceutical
companies ``rely on PBMs to manage their own health-care benefits.''
In your role as an employer, does your company contract with a
pharmaceutical benefit manager (PBM) to administer the prescription
drug benefits for your employees and negotiate lower drug costs on your
behalf?
Answer. Yes, we do.
Question. For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the
prescription drug benefit for your employees, how do you utilize the
rebates your PBM negotiates to lower health-care costs or drug costs
for your employee plans and what does your company do with that
savings? Specifically, do the savings go toward lowing premiums?
Answer. The Sanofi medical plan is self-insured; as such, the
company pays the majority (approximately 80 percent) of the health-care
claims that are incurred by our employees and their dependents.
Therefore, Sanofi uses rebates to defray the overall cost of its health
plan, which allows us to keep plan costs stable for all participants.
We offer our employees generous healthcare coverage and have been
able to keep the deductibles of our PPO, which covers 90% of our
employees who elect medical coverage, at $200 for single coverage and
$400 for family coverage over the past few years. With respect to our
PPO prescription drug benefit, members incur no cost ($0 co-pays) for
Sanofi and partner prescription drugs. For non-Sanofi prescriptions,
the out-of-pocket expense varies for generic ($15/prescription),
preferred brand ($25/prescription) and non-preferred brand ($40/
prescription). The Sanofi plan's actuarial value is around 90%, which
puts it at the ``platinum'' level.
Question. For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the
prescription drug benefit for your employees, does your PBM offer
point-of-sale rebates to your employees?
Answer. Yes, our PBM does offer point-of-sale rebates, however only
around 8 percent of its clients currently are enrolled in point-of-sale
rebates.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse
Question. Please describe any policy changes you support that would
result in your company lowering the list prices of its drugs.
Answer. For Sanofi, the key requirement for any policy solution is
that it should result in improved access and lower prescription out-of-
pocket drug costs for patients, while maintaining incentives for
innovations. To reform the current misaligned incentives in the current
system, Sanofi supports de-linking payments to PBMs, payers and others
in the supply chain from the list price. Additionally, we support
policies that would incentivize lower launch prices, smaller list price
increases, or even list price reductions, by requiring health plans to
cover those medicines at an affordable co-pay level and only allow
access restrictions consistent with the label and accepted best
clinical practice.
Sanofi also supports the intent behind legislation like the SPIKE
Act, which would impose price transparency requirements on companies
that increase the list price of a particular drug over a certain
threshold. We believe that increased transparency should accomplish
three goals: (1) preempt similar state laws, as was done with the
Sunshine Act, to create a consistent reporting process; (2) ensure
information that if released publically could be anti-competitive is
kept confidential; and (3) take a holistic approach to transparency,
such as requiring PBMs to disclose when the net price of a medicine has
declined and whether the increased rebates are used to lower costs for
patients or for other reasons.
Question. How much does your company's research and development
portfolio rely on taxpayer-funded research conducted by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH)? How many of your company's products are
based, at least in part, on NIH research, and how many are the result
of research funded solely by your company?
Answer. In identifying targets for new drugs, Sanofi relies on
global science, which often includes NIH-funded research. Sanofi has
collaborated with NIH on various research and development (R&D)
initiatives on projects related to HIV,
Epstein-Barr virus, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus.
While there is no question that NIH plays a vital role in basic
research and early discovery, the majority of Sanofi's current
portfolio of products in the pre-development to development phases do
not rely on NIH funding. Sanofi reinvests a significant portion of its
revenue into the R&D of new or improved medicines and vaccines. Last
year, Sanofi globally spent almost $7 billion on R&D globally, an
increase of approximately 7 percent from 2017, which reflects our
commitment to bringing better therapies to patients. Sanofi plans to
maintain this level of R&D investment through 2021, and our R&D
pipeline now contains 81 projects, including 33 new molecular entities
in clinical development, and 35 projects that are in Phase III or have
been submitted to regulatory authorities. This investment means that
Sanofi potentially will seek approval for nine new medications in the
next three years, primarily in therapeutic areas where Sanofi sees the
greatest nexus between our expertise and patient need: diabetes,
vaccines, oncology, immunology, rare diseases, and rare blood
disorders.
Question. In each of the last 5 years, how much has your company
spent on research and development versus the advertising and marketing
of your products?

Question. During the hearing, you mentioned that your company would
be likely to lower the list prices of its drugs if the recent proposal
by the Trump administration to change the current system of rebates was
extended to the private market.
If the policy was extended to the private market, how large would
the list price reductions be relative to the size of the rebates your
company is currently providing?
Answer. If (1) the proposed changes to the anti-kickback statute
safe harbors were codified, and (2) Congress implemented similar
changes to the commercial insurance market, Sanofi would lower the list
prices of its prescription medications for products in competitive
categories for which there is currently a material difference between
list price and net price on the assumption that patient access and
affordability would be improved. Sanofi also supports policy changes
that would de-link other payments in the pharmaceutical supply chain
from list price.
We support extending the intent behind the anti-kickback statute
safe harbor proposed rule to the commercial market so that incentives
are aligned across the marketplace. Together, we believe these changes
would facilitate Sanofi's ability to lower its list prices. However, we
recommend a step-wise approach, implementing changes to the commercial
market after the safe harbor rule is implemented on January 1, 2020.
Such an approach would provide an opportunity for stakeholders and the
government to identify unintended consequences, and address them, prior
to extending these policies to the commercial market.
We want to ensure that the new system achieves its goal of
improving affordability for patients. For instance, CMS should monitor
and evaluate how the new system affects formulary access, utilization
management, and patient cost-sharing, particularly with respect to
medicines with a lower list price. We also have concerns that changes
to the rebate system may lead to new fees, which simply require
manufacturers to pay previous rebate values in new ways, rather than
creating savings for patients.
Without a better understanding of how these policy changes
ultimately would affect the competitive marketplace, patient access,
and affordability, we are unable to quantify the amount of any
potential list price reduction.
Question. How will this proposal affect how your company sets the
list prices for new drug products?
Answer. When setting the price of a new medicine, Sanofi's decision
making will continue to be guided by our pricing principles framework.
When Sanofi sets the price of a new medicine in the U.S., we hold
ourselves to a rigorous and structured process that includes
consultation with external stakeholders. In our view, an objective
measure of a new product's value considers the benefit to patients,
compared to a standard of care; the reduced need--and therefore costs--
of other health-care interventions; and any increase in quality of life
and productivity. We believe our pricing reflects these factors. We
also consider factors such as the affordability for patients and any
unique factors specific to the medicine, like the need to support
ongoing clinical trials, implement important regulatory commitments, or
develop sophisticated patient support tools that improve care
management and help decrease the total cost of care.
To the extent reform of the anti-kickback statute safe harbors
results in changes in the competitive marketplace, patient access, and
affordability, the rule is likely to affect our pricing of new
medicines.
Question. If the proposal is finalized and not extended to the
private market, will your company make any list price reductions? If
so, how large would the reductions be relative to the size of the
rebates your company is currently providing?
Answer. Sanofi is committed to working with other stakeholders to
lower patient out-of-pocket costs, and the company will carefully
review any final rule issued by HHS regarding the Anti-Kickback Statute
and its safe harbor regulations--with the goal of providing point-of-
sale discounts to patients, in accordance with law, to lower their out-
of-pocket costs.
Without addressing the currently misaligned incentives across all
payer channels, it is unclear the extent to which Sanofi would be able
to lower list prices. We would need a better understanding of how the
rule ultimately would affect the competitive marketplace, patient
access, and affordability in both the government and commercial
insurance markets in order to quantify the amount of any potential list
price reduction.

Question Submitted by Hon. Maggie Hassan
Question. In June of 2018, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access
Commission (MACPAC) unanimously recommended under Recommendation 1.1 in
their annual report to Congress that Congress remove the statutory
requirement that manufacturers blend the average manufacturer price
(AMP) of a brand drug and its authorized generic.\33\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\33\ MACPAC, ``Improving Operations of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program,'' https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Improving-
Operations-of-the-Medicaid-Drug-Rebate-Program.pdf.
This requirement created an unintended loophole. Rather than use
the price of the authorized generic, drug companies can sell its
authorized generic to a corporate subsidiary at an artificially lower
price, and use that lower price to bring down the AMP, which in turn
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
lowers the rebate obligation.
Does your company engage in this practice? Has your company ever
engaged in this practice in the past?
Answer. Sanofi currently markets authorized generic versions of
certain of its products, through corporate affiliates, under separate
National Drug Codes (``NDC''). Sanofi's general approach for these
products has been that if two products share the same drug, dosage
form, and strength, and both are sold by the same corporate entity or
Sanofi business unit, then their sales are blended for the calculation
of AMP and Best Price.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
Question. In October you were asked by a reporter whether you would
lower the price of insulin if point-of-sale rebates were enacted. Your
response was, ``We realize that some medicines remain economically out
of reach for some patients. We take this issue seriously and will
continue to seek innovative solutions to help make insulins more
affordable for patients.'' Please answer that question more
specifically: will you lower your list price in response to the rebate
rule?
Answer. If (1) the proposed changes to the anti-kickback statute
safe harbors were codified, and (2) Congress implemented similar
changes to the commercial insurance market, Sanofi would lower the list
prices of its prescription medications for products in competitive
categories for which there is currently a material difference between
list price and net price on the assumption that patient access and
affordability would be improved. Sanofi also supports policy changes
that would de-link other payments in the pharmaceutical supply chain
from list price.

Without a better understanding of how these policy changes
ultimately would affect the competitive marketplace, patient access,
and affordability, we are unable to quantify the amount of any
potential list price reduction.
Question. As a portion of your revenue, for what percentage of the
drugs in your portfolio do you offer no rebates? Based on the drugs in
your pipeline, do you foresee that portion growing? For those drugs is
your list price equal to your net price?
Answer. When considering rebates paid by Sanofi in any form,
including those that are government-mandated, Sanofi offers rebates on
all of its products at some point in the distribution channel. We do
not expect that this will change based on the company's pipeline.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you generate in U.S. sales
revenue? Please include specific figures.
Answer. In 2018, Sanofi spent $6,954,920,000 globally on R&D, a 7-
percent increase over 2017 and approximately 24 percent of its global
gross profits. In 2018, Sanofi's U.S. net sales were $13,617,200,000.
Answer. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
administration? What company functions do you consider to be included
in administration? Please include specific figures.
Answer. Yes. In 2018, Sanofi spent $6,954,920,000 globally on R&D,
and $6,921, 880,000 globally on marketing and administration.
``Administration'' includes, but is not limited to: finance, human
resources, external affairs, legal, business services, business
development, and internal audit.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
sales? What company functions do you consider to be included in sales?
Please include specific figures.
Answer. In 2018, Sanofi spent $6,954,920,000 globally on R&D, and
$8,154,980,000 globally on marketing and sales. The primary function
included in ``sales'' is the sales force.
Question. Why do you advertise for the drugs you manufacture? What
factors do you consider in choosing which drugs you advertise?
Answer. Sanofi believes that advertising is an important tool to
inform and educate the public about its medicines, while raising
general awareness of diseases that are frequently surrounded by stigma.
We are committed to ensuring that our advertisements provide accurate,
accessible, and useful health information to patients and consumers.
Our communications are designed to educate patients and consumers about
serious health conditions and the availability of treatments, and to
encourage them to seek guidance from their healthcare professionals
about appropriate treatment. We consider a variety of factors in
determining whether and how to advertise a product, including patient
needs and the unique aspects of an individual product or disease state.

Prepared Statement of Giovanni Caforio, M.D., Chairman of the Board and
Chief Executive Officer, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company
Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the
committee, thank you for the opportunity to be here today on behalf of
the 24,000 employees at Bristol-Myers Squibb, who are working every day
to improve the lives of patients with serious diseases. I look forward
to working together to align incentives to ensure all Americans have
access to the medicines they need.
I am a physician who joined the biopharmaceutical industry 30 years
ago because of the impact companies like Bristol-Myers Squibb--and the
others represented here today--have on patients with serious diseases.
We should all be proud that American companies lead our industry.
Bristol-Myers Squibb researchers have contributed to the
development of medicines that have reduced mortality from
cardiovascular disease, helped transform HIV/AIDS into a chronic
disease, and are now making significant progress in the treatment of
cancer.
Just 10 years ago, the idea of harnessing the immune system to
treat cancer was viewed with great skepticism. But Bristol-Myers Squibb
researchers saw the promise of the approach and ignited an era of
scientific innovation that has changed survival expectations in
multiple tumor types.
Prior to the availability of Immuno-Oncology treatments, only 25
percent of patients diagnosed with metastatic melanoma survived 1 year.
Today, thanks to Immuno-Oncology therapies, this has increased to 74
percent.
The potential of this approach has also been seen in lung cancer,
kidney cancer, and many other difficult-to-treat tumors. Patients with
these diseases now have a chance for quality, long-term survival.
But not all patients respond to current immunotherapies, so we must
do more. We recently opened a new discovery facility dedicated to
investigating Immuno-
Oncology resistance, and we continuously seek external innovation to
augment our pipeline across multiple therapeutic areas. In this
context, we recently announced our plan to acquire Celgene, a natural
next step for our company. Our goal is to bring together the drive and
dedication of two science-driven organizations to do even more for
patients.
As a physician, I recognize that medicines are only helpful if
patients and health-care systems can afford them. We share the
committee's concern with escalating health-care costs and believe that
our responsibility to patients extends to ensuring they can access and
afford our medicines.
The average net pricing across our U.S. portfolio of medicines
increased by 5 percent or less per year during the last 5 years. In
2018, it did not increase and we anticipate the same in 2019.
Despite this fact, we recognize that patients' out-of-pocket costs
continue to increase. We believe it is possible to work together to
realign incentives to ensure patients can afford medicines without
stifling scientific innovation.
So what are the solutions?

We are supportive of the proposed rule aimed at reforming
the rebate system with a focus on what is best for patients.

We need to ensure more generics are available whenever
permissible under our system, and applaud Congress and the
administration's success with speeding the approval of
generics.

We support value-based purchasing arrangements that tie
payments to value. These models can reduce costs, improve
access and adherence, and contribute to better outcomes. We
applaud efforts by Health and Human Services and the Committee
to remove regulatory barriers and facilitate greater use of
these arrangements.
We do not believe the U.S. should adopt policies that stifle
innovation in other countries, which could reduce a patient's access to
new medicines. Outside of the U.S., reimbursement of new medicines can
often take more than two years. Our Opdivo and Yervoy regimen was first
approved in September 2015 to treat metastatic melanoma in the U.S.
Today, six of the 16 countries included in the International Price
Index proposal do not provide access to this combination, which is now
considered the standard of care for this cancer.
This exemplifies why Bristol-Myers Squibb does not support HHS's
proposed International Price Index Model for Medicare Part B drugs.
I would like to leave you with a few thoughts.
We are witnessing a historic era in biomedical innovation. But we
must ensure patients have affordable access to these innovations.
We recognize the need for change, and we are committed to working
with Congress to ensure every patient can benefit from today's medical
innovations.
American research-based companies are leading the next wave of
biomedical innovation to help patients whose diseases cannot be
adequately treated with today's medicines. We should work to ensure
policies that support and reward these investments.
On behalf of my colleagues at Bristol-Myers Squibb, and the
patients we serve, my sincere thanks for your time and attention today.
I look forward to working together to implement real change that
broadens access to innovative medicines for patients.

Questions Submitted for the Record to Giovanni Caforio, M.D.
Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
Question. At the hearing, you testified that Bristol-Myers Squibb
does not withhold samples from generic manufacturers in order to block
generic versions of your drug from entering the market. You also
expressed your support for the ``Creating and Restoring Equal Access to
Equivalent Samples Act,'' also known as the CREATES Act.
As you know, the FDA has a list on its website which identifies
reference listed drug (RLD) access inquiries where brand manufacturers
may have prevented generic companies from obtaining samples of products
necessary to support FDA approval. Celgene is on this FDA list.
According to your testimony, Bristol-Myers Squibb is in the process of
acquiring Celgene.
Are you aware that Celgene is on the FDA list and that Celgene had
multiple access inquiries?
Answer. Yes.
Question. Will you ensure that Bristol-Myers Squibb/Celgene will
not block access to samples once the Celgene acquisition is final?
Answer. As Dr. Caforio testified at the hearing, BMS does not
withhold samples from generic manufacturers in order to block generic
versions of the drug from entering the market. BMS believes it is
important to ensure generics are made available whenever that is
permissible under our system, and supports the administration's focus
on increasing the approval of generics. As part of that system, it is
important that generic companies perform the needed testing to ensure
product quality and patient safety. BMS cannot comment on Celgene's
practices in this area, but once the transaction closes, BMS's
practices with regard to generic samples will govern the combined
portfolio.
Question. The Department of Health and Human Services' proposed
rule, ``Fraud and Abuse; Removal of Safe Harbor Protection for Rebates
Involving Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Creation of New Safe Harbor
Protection for Certain Point-of-Sale Reductions in Price on
Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Certain Pharmacy Benefit Manager
Service Fees,'' envisions that drug manufacturers will offer up-front
discounts rather than the back-end rebates that are now commonly
provided. Some observers argue that a 1996 court case called into
question whether manufacturers could offer up-front discounts,
resulting in today's rebate-based system. I've heard differing opinions
as to whether the issues related to the initial court case are still
relevant. If the HHS proposed rule is finalized, can you assure the
committee that your company will offer up-front discounts? If not, why?
Answer. BMS supports the HHS proposed rule to eliminate safe harbor
protection for back-end rebates under Medicare Part D and the rule's
objective to ensure that patients benefit from price reductions that
BMS provides on its drugs. As the proposed rule notes, there is
uncertainty as to the strategic behavior changes that will occur if the
rule is enacted, and therefore uncertainty as to precise mechanisms
that will be available to meet the objectives of the rule. However,
there is some risk that manufacturers would have to defend themselves
against antitrust litigation if they were to offer up-front discounts
instead of rebates if the proposed rule were finalized. In particular,
there may be risk of claims being crafted under the Robinson-Patman
Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 13. Any such claims would have to meet significant
substantive requirements and be subject to important statutory
defenses. Nonetheless, even if meritless, Robinson-Patman claims can be
expensive and time consuming for manufacturers to defend against.
In light of the potential for antitrust litigation, BMS recommends
that the committee consider how best to address this risk as it
considers the HHS proposal. Congress, could, for example, enact
legislation that immunizes from liability under the Robinson-Patman Act
drug manufacturers who offer up-front discounting under Medicare Part D
in accordance with the fraud and abuse safe harbor created by the HHS
rule.
Question. Please describe how you expect your company to respond to
the HHS proposed rule to eliminate safe harbor protection for back-end
rebates in Medicare Part D that is referenced above if it is finalized.
Assuming you are confident that antitrust laws do not prevent your
company from offering up-front discounts, specifically, do you envision
that your company lowers the list price of a drug to the current after-
rebate net price, offer discounts equal to the current rebate amount,
or a combination of both?
Answer. BMS supports the HHS proposed rule to eliminate safe harbor
protection for back-end rebates in Medicare Part D, and we believe it
would lead to lower out-of-pocket costs. This question rightly supposes
that the goals of the proposed rule could be achieved through lower
list prices, negotiated discounts at the point-of-sale, or some
combination of these two approaches. While it is unclear how Part D
plans and PBMs will react to the proposed rule, at this time, BMS
envisions that we would offer point-of-sale discounts to Part D plans
equivalent on average to the current contracted rebate amount and will
continue to assess the possibility of lowering list price on a product-
by-product basis. Our ability to lower list prices, however, is
constrained by the fact that the HHS proposed rule does not apply to
the commercial insurance market, where we anticipate back-end rebates
to continue for the foreseeable future.
Please also see the answer to the previous question.
Question. To what extent are the back-end rebates your company
currently offers contingent on the amount of market share realized for
your drugs as a result of Part D plan formulary placement and other
techniques?
Answer. The back-end rebates BMS currently offers pursuant to its
Medicare Part D agreements are not contingent on the amount of market
share realized for any of BMS's drugs as a result of Part D plan
formulary placement or any other performance requirement.
Question. Please provide a breakdown of percentage of sales that go
to each payer (including Medicare, Medicaid, private pay, other) and a
similar percentage by volume of the total number of each drug compared
to total volume. Please provide this data for the most recent year
available.
Answer. This information is not available publicly and is
competitively sensitive.
Question. Do your companies hire consultants or lobbyists to
promote products at State Medicaid Pharmacy and Therapeutics
Committees? To whom do you disclose advocacy activities surrounding
State Medicaid programs, if at all?
Answer. BMS does not hire consultants or lobbyists to promote its
products at State Medicaid P&T Committees. BMS complies with the
applicable lobbying laws across all 50 States, Puerto Rico, and the
District of Columbia. Many States require engagement with its Medicaid
officials to be reported. We disclose required lobbying activities to
each State in accordance with the individual State lobbying disclosure
and ethics laws.
Question. Please describe how the costs of patient assistance
programs are accounted for within your company's financial statements.
Please also describe the types of market information, such as
prescribing and use patterns that your company collects from different
types of patient assistance programs and patient hub services.
Answer. For purposes of responding to this request, BMS interprets
``patient assistance programs'' and ``patient hub services'' as BMS
programs or services supporting education, access and/or treatment
adherence for eligible patients who are prescribed a BMS medicine.
Costs associated with these programs are accounted for in our financial
statements as marketing, selling and administrative expenses or gross-
to-net sales adjustments, depending on the type of assistance offered.
Data captured through the administration of patient support
programs allows our program administrators to validate information
provided directly from patients and providers in support of the
specific program(s) for which assistance is being requested. This data
capture includes, but may not be limited to: (1) information that
supports determination of patient eligibility; (2) validation of
licensed provider/prescriber; (3) prescription related information
necessary to execute patient assistance available through program(s)
(i.e., dosage and units being prescribed/dispensed); and, (4) insurance
information.
Question. Please provide a list of all contributions since January
1, 2014, that your company has made to any tax exempt organizations
working on issues related to drugs within your product lines, including
but not limited to patient groups, disease awareness groups, medical or
professional societies, universities or hospitals, industry
associations or leagues. For each contribution, please provide the name
of the organization that received the donation, the date the donation
was made, the amount of the donation, and a description of the purpose
of the contribution (i.e., was the contribution for the general fund, a
specific purpose to a specific program, or continuing medical
education). Please also note whether the contribution was unrestricted
or restricted; if it was restricted, please explain all restrictions.
Finally, if your company maintains a foundation or other separate
charitable arm, please provide the name of all such entities, and list
all donations made from that entity or entities.
Answer. BMS refers the committee to the Corporate Giving page on
the BMS website (https://www.bms.com/about-us/responsibility/corporate-
giving.html). This page includes comprehensive information about BMS'
Corporate Giving policies and practices. It also includes comprehensive
lists of IME Grants, Charitable Donations and Corporate Giving for
calendar years 2016, 2017 and 2018. These grants are made for a variety
of appropriate purposes, not limited to issues related to drugs within
the BMS product line.
BMS supports the BMS Patient Assistance Foundation (BMSPAF), a non-
profit organization that helps patients in the United States who need
temporary help obtaining various BMS medications. In 2018, BMS donated
over $1 billion worth of BMS medicines to the BMSPAF, and the BMSPAF
provided free medicine to more than 75,000 patients.
BMS also supports the Bristol-Myers Squibb Foundation, a non-profit
organization that promotes health equity and seeks to improve the
health outcomes of populations disproportionately affected by serious
diseases by strengthening health-care worker capacity, integrating
medical care and community based support services, and mobilizing
communities to fight against disease. BMS views the activities of the
BMS Foundation as outside the scope of this question.
Question. Pay for delay agreements cost consumers and taxpayers
billions in higher drug costs every year. The FTC has gone after drug
companies that enter into these settlements where the brand pays the
generic company to keep its lower cost alternative off the market. I'm
the lead Republican sponsor of S. 64, the ``Preserve Access to
Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act,'' which would help put an end
to these deals.
Do you agree that these pay-off agreements keep drug costs high for
patients because they delay competition?
Answer. BMS agrees that patent settlement agreements that have
substantial payments going from innovators to generics, and are solely
intended to delay competition, are anticompetitive.
Question. Has your company ever entered into these kinds of
settlements with a generic company?
Answer. BMS has not entered into patent settlements that have
substantial payments going from innovator to generics and are solely
intended to delay competition.
Question. Do you support the pay for delay bill?
Answer. In general, the ability to settle patent litigation, like
any litigation, reflects a balancing of considerations by the involved
parties and often leads to earlier generic entry than patent
expiration. The current system provides the government with the ability
to monitor and review these settlements, and has worked well.
With regard to S. 64, BMS supports the goals of the legislation but
has objections to the legislation as currently drafted. For example,
the legislation should be revised: (1) only to apply prospectively and
not retroactively to agreements already entered into; (2) eliminate the
presumption that all settlements are presumptively anticompetitive; (3)
eliminate restrictions on the arguments companies would be permitted to
advance to defend agreements; and (4) include ``exclusions'' for
certain types of agreements, such as those containing exclusive
licenses, to name a few. BMS would be happy to follow up and provide
further details to the committee.
rebate traps/walls
Question. I'm increasingly concerned about the effect of so-called
``rebate traps'' or ``rebate walls'' on patients' access to quality,
lower cost medicine. I understand there is ongoing litigation
challenging these practices as anti-competitive.
Does your company engage in the bundling of rebates over multiple
products? If so, why? And what benefit does the consumer gain from
that?
Answer. BMS does not have any Medicare Part D or any other payer
contracts with bundling of rebates.
Question. Does your company view these practices as anticompetitive
or harmful to patients' access to quality, lower cost medicine?
Answer. BMS believes that clinical treatment decisions should be
made by physicians in consultation with patients. As noted, BMS does
not have bundled payer agreements and without insight to the specific
terms of other manufacturers' bundling agreements, it is difficult to
assess the impact on patient access and healthcare costs. BMS does not
support agreements that create barriers to patients' access to quality,
lower cost medicines.
Question. If a policy were adopted to eliminate rebates, or to
require that rebate savings be passed on to the consumer, would that in
and of itself solve the issue of rebate ``traps'' and ``walls''? And
would consumers benefit from such a policy?
Answer. BMS believes that requiring PBMs and payers to pass
manufacturer rebates on to patients has the potential to lower patient
out-of-pocket costs, and therefore benefit consumers. However, it is
unclear how payers will adjust their benefit plan designs in response
to this change and whether it would completely solve the issue of
rebate ``traps'' and ``walls.'' It is possible, for example, that in
response to such changes, PBM and payer business models might evolve,
and thus we recommend implementing safeguards to protect consumers'
access to medicines.
drug pricing
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider regulatory costs or compliance? If so, how specifically do
those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at least
one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
Answer. BMS does not consider these costs in setting list price.
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider the risk of liability or litigation? If so, how specifically
do those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at
least one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
Answer. BMS does not consider the risk of liability or litigation
in setting list price.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Pat Roberts
Question. What role do you see Value Based Arrangements (VBAs)
playing in the effort to reduce prescription drug costs? What potential
do these arrangements have to find the ``sweet spot'' between
controlling costs to patients and encouraging innovation of new drugs?
Answer. Manufacturers and payers have been participating in Value
Based Agreements (VBAs) with increasing frequency. These agreements can
potentially reduce overall health-care costs by reducing costs for
medicines, and importantly, improving outcomes for patients and
reducing overall health-care costs. Although there are many types of
VBAs, and the goals and impact of these arrangements differ by specific
medicines and therapeutic areas, we believe that as the sophistication
of these payer and manufacturer arrangements increase, and the capture,
integrity and timeliness of health-care data improves, these agreements
will evolve to the ``sweet spot'' between controlling costs and
encouraging the innovation of new medicines.
Question. How can VBAs help lower what patients pay out-of-pocket?
Answer. VBAs may lower patient out-of-pocket costs where, as a
result of the VBA, the drug is placed on a preferred or lower formulary
tier. In addition, as explained above, VBAs can potentially reduce
overall healthcare costs, including patient out-of-pocket costs, by
improving outcomes for patients through the reduction or elimination of
the need for additional medicines and/or healthcare services.
Question. Can Congress do more to allow for and encourage the use
of VBAs?
Answer. Yes. Congress can do more to allow for and encourage the
use of VBAs. For example, Congress could adopt an exception to the
Anti-Kickback Statute and enact measures to avoid unintended
consequences under Medicaid price reporting.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
Question. We continue to hear that rebates negotiated off of the
list price of a drug are both good and bad. Pharmacy benefit managers
and plans have argued that rebates are used to lower premiums across
the board and that it is the best way to seek a price concession on
otherwise expensive drugs. Your industry argues that these payers are
insisting on higher rebates that can only be achieved by raising list
prices. But patients often lose under this system, with out of pocket
costs being tied to list price. Insulin patients appear to be routinely
impacted by this perversity in the system.
Please explain to the committee how your company would reduce list
prices if rebates were no longer a part of the equation?
Answer. BMS supports the HHS proposed rule to eliminate safe harbor
protection for back-end rebates in Medicare Part D, and we believe it
would lead to lower out-of-pocket costs. The goals of the proposed rule
could be achieved through lower list prices, negotiated discounts at
the point-of-sale, or some combination of these two approaches. While
it is unclear how Part D plans and PBMs will react to the proposed
rule, at this time, BMS envisions that we would offer point-of-sale
discounts to Part D plans equivalent on average to the contracted
rebate amount and will continue to assess the possibility of lowering
list prices on a product-by-product basis. BMS would likely follow a
similar approach if back-end rebates were eliminated from the
commercial insurance market.
Question. What assurance can you provide that you would in fact
lower your prices?
Answer. Please see answer to previous question.
Question. What actions should be taken to ensure that patients are
actually seeing the benefits of lower out of pocket costs?
Answer. In order to ensure that patients receive the full benefits
of manufacturer discounts, we support the proposed rule's requirement
that manufacturer discounts be passed on to patients at the point-of-
sale. In addition, we recommend implementing safeguards to protect
consumers' access to medicines, to prevent increases in patients' out-
of-pocket costs, and to ensure that patients' costs at the point-of-
sale fully reflect manufacturer discounts.
Question. If rebates are driving high list prices for drugs as drug
manufacturers' claim, why do you think that Part B drugs, which have no
PBM rebates, are also seeing significant price increases? Whose fault
is that?
Answer. The price increases for BMS Part B drugs have been largely
in line with Medical CPI. We cannot comment on the Part B price
increase practices of other manufacturers.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
re-evaluating business strategies in foreign countries
Question. Since taking office, President Trump has made reducing
drug prices one of his highest priorities--and has repeatedly spoken
about his frustration with the U.S. subsidizing the costs of
pharmaceuticals for the rest of the world. He has gone so far as to
issue proposals, like the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model, in
an attempt to bring down prescription drug prices.
With the increased scrutiny of the industry and of the drug supply
chain as a whole in the United States, have any of your companies re-
evaluated your business strategy in foreign countries?
Answer. Please see answer below.
Question. If not, then why?
Answer. Please see answer below.
Question. If a proposal, like IPI, were implemented, would it force
your companies to potentially ``walk away from the negotiating table
when other countries demand low prices subsidized by America's
seniors,'' as HHS Senior Advisor for Drug Pricing Reform John O'Brien
has said?
Answer. Please see answer below.
Question. What are some of your ideas on how we can ensure
Americans aren't shouldering the full cost of pharmaceuticals?
Answer. BMS reviews its business strategies within and outside of
the U.S. on a regular basis. BMS believes that all patients deserve
access to life changing medicines. Because of these ethical
considerations, BMS would not walk away from discussions about access
to our medicines in foreign countries. We believe that the most likely
outcome of IPI is further delays in access to life extending and
innovative medicines within the referenced countries, resulting in, for
example, lower cancer survival rates.
The IPI proposal imposes price controls in the U.S. based on the
policies of foreign countries with socialized health-care systems that
often deny their citizens access to innovative medicines. Patients in
many of the countries included in the reference basket wait
significantly longer for new, life extending and innovative medicines
to reach them. Outside of the U.S., reimbursement of new medicines can
often take more than 2 years. In Greece, for example, only 8 percent of
new cancer therapies are available, and on average it requires 32
months for these products to be available to patients. In comparison,
in the U.S., 96 percent of new cancer drugs are available within 3
months of market approval. Eventually, the industry often accepts
foreign prices which do not recognize the value and cost-effectiveness
of our medicines because patients can wait no longer.
BMS is committed to working with Congress and the administration to
advance better, more effective ways to lower drug prices for patients.
As an alternative to the IPI model, finalizing the proposed rebate rule
would lower seniors' out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy counter.
Regulatory reforms at the FDA are leading to more medicine approvals
and greater competition in the market. Value-based arrangements (VBAs)
and indication-based pricing (IBP) can reduce the payer risk of
exposure to failed outcomes, more closely associate drug costs and
value, and make prescription medicines more affordable for patients.
foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
Question. President Trump and Secretary Azar have both repeatedly
described their frustrations with ``foreign freeloading'' of U.S. drugs
in the last year.
``When foreign governments extort unreasonably low prices from U.S.
drug makers, Americans have to pay more to subsidize the enormous cost
of research and development. . . . It's unfair and it's ridiculous, and
it's not going to happen any longer.''
Do you agree that because of foreign countries' pricing and
reimbursement systems, U.S. patients and innovators are shouldering the
burden for financing medical advances?
Answer. Please see answer below.
Question. How do foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
systems affect our prescription drug costs?
Answer. Please see answer below.
Question. Are foreign governments taking note of the concerns being
raised by the Trump administration, and have they responded in any way?
Answer. Please see answer below.
Question. Has there been any noticeable change in any of our trade
agreements since these concerns have been raised by the Trump
administration?
Answer. Drug pricing in markets outside of the U.S. must take into
account significant differences in economic status, cultural beliefs
and values, as well as differences in the local processes for setting
prices, which vary significantly from market-to-market. Countries vary
significantly in their per capita gross domestic product (GDP), their
willingness to invest in, and provide rapid access to, health-care
innovation, their focus on a single best average treatment for a
population versus focusing on patient heterogeneity and preserving
consumer choice and provider autonomy, and their tolerance and
acceptability for optimal patient care.
The countries selected for international comparison through the IPI
model are not economically comparable with the U.S. Many of the
countries in the IPI model, most notably Greece, the Czech Republic,
and Italy, do not have comparable economies as measured in per capita
gross domestic product (GDP). The significant difference in drug costs
between the U.S. and other countries referred to by CMS in the IPI
proposal is also seen with the comparative cost of physician services,
hospital care, diagnostics, and medical devices. For example, according
to a recent report by the OECD, hospital services in the U.S. cost 150
percent more than in Japan, France, Germany, Finland and Spain; 170
percent higher than in UK, Greece, and Italy.
Through the USMCA and other trade actions, the Trump administration
has taken steps to crack down on foreign violations of U.S.
intellectual property rights. There remain, however, several practices
that undermine U.S. intellectual property and violate existing trade
deals. We need to continue to negotiate better trade deals with better
enforcement that protect American medical innovations.
medicaid closed formulary proposals
Question. In an attempt to bring down drug costs, various States
have been exploring whether to exclude certain drugs from its Medicaid
program. For example, the State of Massachusetts' recently asked CMS
for permission to create a closed formulary where the State Medicaid
program would pick at least one drug per therapeutic class. CMS denied
their waiver request citing violation of Federal law, but this proposal
does bring up important questions on how to contain drug prices in
State Medicaid programs.
If the principles of the Medicare Part D program--including the
necessary patient protections--were applied to State Medicaid programs,
do you think it lower drugs costs while ensuring access to patients?
Answer. It is unlikely that applying Part D principles to Medicaid
would lower drug costs. Medicaid is already a lower-cost channel and
patients have little to no copay obligations.
medicaid ``best price''
Question. In the Trump administration's Blueprint, they suggested
that because drug manufactures have to give Medicaid the ``best price''
on drugs, there is no incentive to offer deeper discounts to other
payers--both government and commercial--than what is already offered
under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Does the Medicaid ``best price'' requirement encourage
manufacturers to increase initial prices?
Answer. For BMS, Medicaid ``best price'' is not a consideration in
determining initial product pricing.
Question. What, if any, changes would you suggest we make to the
program?
Answer. As clarification, prices offered to Medicare Part D plans
are excluded from Medicaid ``best price,'' and therefore, manufacturers
can offer deeper discounts to Part D without impacting Medicaid best
price.
More generally, BMS recommends the creation of an exemption from
best price and AMP for select value based purchasing arrangements and
greater clarity on best price and AMP reporting on issues related to
such arrangements.
outcomes-based contracts
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you highlight your
support of outcomes-based contracts and how we need to be shifting our
system toward that approach.
How will these contracts lower drug costs for patients in both the
near term and long-term?
Answer. The goal and design of outcome-based contracts will vary
depending on the specific drug and the therapeutic area/disease State
which is being evaluated. In general, outcome-based contracts are
designed to demonstrate the efficacy, safety, clinical superiority,
cost savings and/or improvement in overall patient health outcomes. To
the extent that outcomes-based contracts demonstrate improvement in
clinical outcomes and/or reduction in overall health-care costs and
facilitate access to appropriate medicines, patients will benefit from
improved outcomes and reduced out-of-pocket costs, and Federal health-
care programs will benefit from lower overall health-care costs.
Question. How will they lower overall health-care costs for our
Federal programs?
Answer. Please see answer to previous question.
Question. What have the preliminary results looked like so far?
Answer. Eliquis has demonstrated a better safety profile than
alternate therapies (less bleeding events) as proven through outcomes-
based contracts using real world data. Oncology patients have higher
rates of diagnostic testing done to monitor disease progression (as
recommended by guidelines), through our testing based value-based
contract.
transparency/point of sale
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you express your
support for the Trump administration's proposal to allow manufacturers
to provide PBMs up-front discounts that are passed onto patients at the
point-of-sale.
Do you feel like this proposal will make the transactions within
the drug supply chain more transparent?
Answer. To the extent that discounts provided by manufacturers to
PBMs and payers are passed through to the patients at the point-of-
sale, transactions within the drug supply chain will be more
transparent.
Question. If so, would this transparency bring down drug costs--
overall and for specialty drugs?
Answer. In terms of bringing down drug costs, the result of passing
discounts through to patients at the point-of-sale will likely vary
depending on the individual drug. We anticipate that patients who are
prescribed high-cost, highly discounted drugs, primarily specialty
drugs, and are subject to high co-insurance costs, will experience the
greatest reduction in drug costs.
the relationship between wholesalers and manufacturers
Question. When talking about the pharmaceutical supply chain, a lot
of focus has been placed on the Pharmacy Benefit Manager. But there's
another side of the equation that I'd like to ask about.
How do wholesalers negotiate pricing with manufacturers?
Answer. Wholesalers and manufacturers negotiate distribution
service agreements that include terms and fees. The fees are typically
a percentage of list price.
Question. What impact does this have on drug costs?
Answer. It is BMS's understanding that the fees negotiated by
wholesalers and manufacturers do not have a material impact on drug
costs.
Question. What incentives or disincentives do they have to contain
price increases?
Answer. This question is best answered by wholesalers.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
proposed rebate rule
Question. As has been done in many other settings, drug
manufacturers said during the hearing that one reason list prices for
drugs are high is that pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) demand
larger and larger rebates in order for the drug to receive favorable
placement on a formulary. You and your colleagues who testified during
the hearing stated if the administration's proposal on changes to the
anti-kickback safe harbor for pharmaceutical rebates took effect, your
company would likely lower list price.
Like many Oregonians, I am skeptical drug manufacturers would
voluntarily lower their prices. Therefore, would you support
legislation that would (1) make similar changes the administration has
put forward related to Part D and Medicaid managed care, (2) change the
rebate system in a similar way to the proposal for the commercial
market, and (3) require drug makers to lower the list price of their
drugs equal to the amount of rebates provided today?
Answer. BMS supports the extension of rebate reforms to the
commercial market. However, given the significant market change in the
proposed Part D safe harbor change, we urge the committee to pursue an
implementation timeline that will allow manufacturers, PBMs, plans,
retail pharmacies, wholesalers, and other impacted parties to address
the many operational challenges for the industry. We anticipate that
the implementation of the safe harbor change in Part D will provide
important learnings, but in order to extend these changes to the
commercial market, industry will need additional lead time to do so.
Given the many payers and channels in the health-care market, an
individual drug has multiple net price points. Moreover, the goals of
the proposed rebate rule can be achieved not only through lower list
prices, but also through negotiated discounts at the point-of-sale, or
through some combination of the two approaches. We believe the goals of
the proposed rule can be best achieved by giving manufacturers the full
range of options in their negotiations with plans and PBMs.
Consequently, BMS would not support legislation that required drug
makers to lower the list price of their drugs equal to the amount of
rebates provided today.
There may be instances where a reduction in product list price is
warranted, but with or without a list price change, in order for
patients to benefit fully from the changes, regulations would need to
ensure that manufacturer discounts are passed through to patients at
the point-of-sale and that patient out-of-pocket costs are based on
product net price.
medicaid drug rebate program
Question. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) requires
manufacturers to provide a basic rebate and an additional inflationary
rebate for both brand and generic drugs. The inflationary rebate is an
increasingly substantial part of total rebates due in large part to
large increases in drug prices that exceed inflation. Under current
law, this inflationary rebate is capped at 100 percent of Average
Manufacturer Price (AMP). This is the case even when manufacturers
continue to raise their prices well above inflation.
Please provide a list of all of your pharmaceutical products that
have reached the Medicaid AMP rebate cap in any of the 20 quarters from
January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018.
Answer. Please see answer below.
Question. For each drug listed in response to question 1, please
also provide a list of which quarters and years each drug hit the cap.

medicaid drug rebate program compliance
Question. I am concerned about recent reports and legal settlements
surrounding drug manufacturers' failure to comply fully with the
requirements of the MDRP. For example, an analysis by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General
found that between 2012 and 2016 taxpayers may have overpaid by as much
as $1.3 billion for 10 potentially misclassified drugs. That is why I
introduced the Right Rebate Act with Chairman Grassley to prevent drug
manufacturers from manipulating Medicaid to increase their profits.
However, I continued to be concerned about oversight and manufacturer
compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Accordingly, please describe the following:
Your company's current compliance plan and procedures used to
ensure compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program including internal audits or other checks you use to identify
compliance vulnerabilities.
Answer. The Company routinely assigns new employees working in the
government pricing area formal training on U.S. government pricing and
contracting. This training includes an overview of the Medicaid Program
obligations and requirements. BMS also maintains policy and procedural
documents which govern compliance relative to the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program. In addition, BMS periodically holds informal training sessions
as part of departmental and other internal meetings, where compliance
training is provided on topics relevant to the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program. BMS has also identified key controls related to the Medicaid
Drug Rebate Program which are independently tested as part of the
Company's Sarbanes-Oxley controls. As part of these controls, all
Medicaid pricing submissions are reviewed and approved by the
appropriate Company management. In addition, BMS Global Internal Audit
and Assurance periodically conducts internal audits of the Company's
operations, which include activities that support the Medicaid Drug
Rebate Program.
Question. Any past or ongoing issues of non-compliance.
Answer. There are no ongoing issues of non-compliance with the
Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, nor were there any within the past 5
years. (BMS interprets the question as asking for a reasonable period
in the past, and has selected 5 years).
Question. Any corrective actions taken to address identified
problems or issues of non-compliance with the MDRP and how such steps
were communicated to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Answer. There are no ongoing issues of non-compliance with the
Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, nor were there any within the past 5
years. (BMS interprets the question as asking for a reasonable period
in the past, and has selected 5 years).
Question. Any steps taken to improve compliance and ensure that all
Medicaid drug rebates owed to the Federal Government and the States are
paid in full.
Answer. In addition to the compliance and audit activities already
outlined, the BMS Government Pricing team conducts regular cross-
functional information sharing meetings in order to facilitate
communication within the organization, to gather all relevant pricing
and contracting information, and to provide education that is focused
on ensuring compliance with our Medicaid reporting obligations. The
Government Pricing team also conducts quarterly Medicaid Best Price
review meetings with key members of the pricing and contracting
organization and requires that leaders of key functions within the
pricing and contracting organization sign-off on quarterly Medicaid
Best Price information prior to the Company's final. Additionally, the
Company has made significant investments in the systems which are used
to support the calculation and payment of Medicaid rebates to help
ensure greater compliance, standardization and automation of our
processes. BMS also maintains a Compliance and Ethics hotline and
encourages all employees to raise potential compliance concerns so that
they can be investigated and addressed.
More specifically with regard to the payment of Medicaid drug
rebates, based on the current portfolio of active drugs, all BMS drugs
are classified as Innovator Single Source or Innovator Multiple Source
drugs which are subject to the higher basic rebate calculation. When
BMS launches a new drug that is subject to Medicaid reporting, the drug
classification is reviewed as part of the Medicaid submission approval
process.
To the extent that BMS has questions on MDRP compliance or on
interpretative approaches to MDRP price reporting, we communicate with
the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
bonus payments tied to specific drugs
Question. I am concerned by the potential for employee financial
incentives to encourage high launch prices and price increases for
prescription drugs.
Is your salary, bonus, or other compensation tied to sales or
revenue targets of a single product your company sells? Has it ever
been? If yes, please state the product or products to which your
salary, bonus or other compensation was tied.
Answer. No, Dr. Caforio's salary and bonus are not tied to sales or
revenue targets for a single product. Dr. Caforio's compensation is
tied in part to the revenue of the Company as a whole. Please see
answer below.
Question. Is your salary, bonus, or other compensation tied to
either revenue or net income of the company as a whole? Has it ever
been? If yes, please explain what assumptions about price increases are
used when the compensation committee sets revenue or net income goals.
Does the compensation committee provide any guidance to executives in
regards to the amount of revenue that the company will generate from
price increases versus volume growth?
Answer. Dr. Caforio's compensation is tied in part to the revenue
of the Company as a whole. The revenue metric is based on the overall
Company target for the applicable performance period (annual for annual
bonus and longer-term, 3 years for Performance Share Units), which
typically includes assumptions concerning both price changes and volume
growth. Over the last few years, BMS' revenue growth has been primarily
attributable to increased volume arising from increased demand for our
products rather than price increases.
Dr. Caforio's compensation is reviewed and recommended by the
Compensation and Management Development Committee, which is a committee
consisting of only independent directors, and approved by at least
three-fourths of the independent directors of our Board of Directors.
The Compensation Management and Development committee annually
completes a thoughtful and rigorous evaluation of the Company's
executive compensation program to ensure that the program is aligned
with our mission and delivers shareholder value, while not encouraging
excessive or inappropriate risk-taking by our executives. When
determining metrics and setting incentive plan targets each year and
for 3 year performance period, the committee is aware of the risks
associated with drug pricing, among other risks, and ensures our plans
do not incentivize risky behavior in order to meet targets and goals.
net prices
Question. In your testimony you stated, ``for this reason, the
average net pricing across our U.S. portfolio of medicines increased by
5 percent of the last year-over-year for the last 5 years. Importantly,
it did not increase at all in 2018 and we expect that it will not
increase in 2019.'' Please describe how the company's year-over-year
aggregate net price is calculated. Please also specifically address the
following questions.
Answer. Dr. Caforio testified that BMS's average net pricing across
the company's U.S. portfolio increased by 5 percent or less year-over-
year for the last 5 years. Please see the answer below for a
description of how year-over-year net price is calculated.
Question. How many products are included in the calculation of the
average net price change? What was the median net price change?
Answer. Approximately 20 products are included in the calculation
of the average net price change. The median net price change over the
last 5 years is 3.4% based on the following net price change per year:
2018
2017
2016
2015
2014
(0.3%)
1.6%
5.2%
3.4%
4.0%
Question. Is net price weighted? If so, how? For example, in
determining the aggregate net price does the company assign different
weights to different products based on volume or other factors? Are
``on patent'' and ``off patent'' drugs weighted identically? Are other
statistical weights used or are all products treated equally?
Answer. Net price is weighted according to the product's sales
relative to total BMS sales. Year-over-year change in Net Price =
Change in List Price + Change in effective discount rate across all
channels. Patent and off-patent drugs are treated equally in the
calculation.
Question. Does the figure that you provided during your testimony
account for U.S. prices, international prices, or both? Generally
speaking, when your company reports net price changes, does it
differentiate between U.S. and international prices?
Answer. The figure included in Dr. Caforio's testimony accounted
for U.S. prices. Yes, BMS discloses by region (i.e., U.S., Europe, Rest
of World) in our quarterly 10Q and Annual 10K filings. However, the
only net price changes specifically outlined (i.e., in percentage
terms) is for the U.S.
Question. Please list the five drugs your company sold in the U.S.
that had the greatest year-over-year net price increase in 2018, noting
the increase for each drug by dollar figure and percentage. Please list
the five drugs your company sold in the U.S. that had the lowest year-
over-year net price increase (and/or the greatest decrease) in 2018,
noting the increase (or decrease) for each drug by dollar figure and
percentage.
Answer. This question calls for information that BMS does not
disclose publicly and considers to be competitively sensitive.
Question. For 2018, what was the average net price change in the
U.S. market for (1) drugs with no competition, (2) drugs with only
branded competition, and (3) drugs with generic competition?
Answer. This questions calls for information that BMS does not
disclose publicly and considers to be competitively sensitive.
Question. You stated that average net price increased 5 percent in
2017, but did not increase in 2018, and that you do not expect it to
increase in 2019. What factors contributed to the change from 2017 to
2018? What would the net price increase have been if your company
excluded the impact of drugs like Reyataz and Sustiva, which lost
exclusivity in the United States at the end of 2017, and Daklinza,
which the company reported losing revenue on?
Answer. Dr. Caforio testified that BMS's average net pricing across
the Company's U.S. portfolio increased by 5 percent or less year-over-
year for the last 5 years. Average U.S. net price remained unchanged
from 2017 to 2018 (i.e., 0 percent net price increase from 2017 to
2018), because discounts across all channels increased at a rate higher
than list price increased. If drugs which lost exclusivity, like
Reyataz, Sustiva and Daklinza, were excluded, the net price change
would still be 0 percent.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez
Question. When new products enter the market, do drug companies set
high initial rebates and then provide deep rebates in order to gain
access to insurance plan's formularies?
Answer. BMS does not. We cannot comment on the pricing practices of
other manufacturers.
Question. If CMS finalizes the rebate rule, do you anticipate
future products entering the market with significantly lower initial
list prices?
Answer. If CMS were to finalize the rebate rule, the impact on list
prices of future products would likely differ by product depending on
such factors as the clinical profile of the product, competition,
market dynamics, and the channel into which the product is primarily
sold. As noted above, the goals of the proposed rule could be achieved
through lower list prices, negotiated discounts at the point-of-sale,
or some combination of these two approaches.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Thomas R. Carper
Question. What are your recommendations for lowering prices for the
40 percent of drugs that do not offer rebates in Medicare Part D?
Answer. BMS believes that market-based reforms are the best way to
lower costs and maintain the appropriate incentives for innovation. BMS
supports policies that enable payers to negotiate innovative and
flexible ways to pay for medicines, including value-based purchasing
arrangements. Additionally, we need to ensure generics are available
whenever permissible under our system. BMS notes also that even
manufacturers pay coverage gap discounts for all Part D drugs
regardless of whether a payer rebate is provided for that drug.
Question. In the health insurance plans that you offer your
employees, do you ask your insurers to pass through the full
manufacturer rebates to the beneficiaries?
Answer. Based on the contract negotiated with the PBM with which
BMS has contracted, BMS has elected to reinvest the rebates we would
otherwise have received from the PBM to reduce the per claim cost for
brand drugs across the entire population of members we cover. BMS
provides health care coverage to approximately 10,000 active employees,
4,000 retirees and 18,000 spouses and other dependents.
Under this reinvested model, those rebate dollars are applied to
reduce the negotiated rate our enrollees pay for brand drugs. This
means that the PBM charges the plan a lower negotiated rate for all
branded drugs (not just those associated with specific rebates),
benefiting a broader portion of our covered population. Since our
health plan benefit design uses a coinsurance for member cost sharing,
this lower negotiated drug cost enabled by the application of the
rebate value, reduces the coinsurance amount our members pay for their
medications at the pharmacy counter.
Question. The systems for pricing and distributing drugs are opaque
and difficult to understand. What are your recommendations for
increasing transparency in how your companies set the list prices for
drugs, and for improving transparency in the supply chain for
prescription drugs? Would you support Federal standards for
transparency in setting the list prices for drugs?
Answer. BMS intends to provide added transparency around the list
prices for its medicines. We are creating pricing pages for all of our
advertised medicine websites to include list price and additional
information on out-of-pocket costs and support programs. Any DTC TV ads
will direct patients to the site through a web link. Our plan is to
have this information available by April 15, 2019. We solicited
feedback from the patient community to ensure the resources we provide
about pricing are meaningful to patients. The research suggests
patients may misinterpret list price information in a television
advertisement without additional context.
BMS is complying with the recently enacted California drug price
transparency legislation and would like to work with the committee on
similar legislation at the Federal level, or legislation similar to the
SPIKE Act (S. 474), both of which are intended to require manufacturers
to disclose price increases above a certain threshold.
Question. In nearly every sector of the health-care industry,
Medicare, Medicaid, employers, and insurers are moving away from fee-
for-service payments to reimbursements based on value and performance.
Prescription drugs and medical devices were the glaring exceptions to
this trend until recently. How many of your drugs are included in
value-based contracts and how many patients are benefiting from them?
How do these value-based contracts work to lower drug prices for both
patients and taxpayers?
Answer. Currently, BMS has value-based contracts for two products.
Approximately 39 million patients are eligible for potential coverage
under those contracts.
The goal and design of outcome-based contracts will vary depending
on the specific drug and the therapeutic area/disease state which is
being evaluated. In general, outcome-based contracts are designed to
demonstrate the efficacy, safety, clinical superiority, cost savings
and/or improvement in overall patient health outcomes. To the extent
that outcomes-based contracts demonstrate improvement in clinical
outcomes and/or reduction in overall health-care costs, patients will
benefit from improved outcomes and reduced costs, and the Federal
programs will benefit from lower overall health-care costs.
Question. Last year, Senator Portman and I did an investigation on
the pricing of an opioid overdose reversal drug called EVZIO,
manufactured by Kaleo. Kaleo increased the price of EVZIO from $575 in
2014 to $4,100 in 2017. We found that the best price Medicare was able
to get for EVZIO, about $4,000, was much higher than the price other
Federal programs and private insurers were able to get. It seemed that
Kaleo was able to get this higher price of $4,000 from Medicare by
helping doctors fill out paperwork showing that the drug was medically
necessary, even though there are cheaper alternatives on the market. As
a result of the investigation, Kaleo announced it will bring a generic
version of the drug to market at only $168 per pack. Are any of your
companies providing medical necessity paperwork to doctors in order to
get your drugs covered by Medicare?
Answer. BMS offers patient support programs that help eligible
patients who are prescribed our medicines obtain access to those
medicines. This includes assisting patients in navigating the insurance
approval process. Consistent with longstanding OIG guidance and common
industry practices, BMS does provide the template forms required by
insurers for use in making coverage determinations, but BMS does not
provide medical necessity content. That content must be independently
provided by the prescribing health-care provider.
Question. In 2017, the Rand Corporation estimated that biosimilar
drugs, which are competitors to complex, biologic drugs, could save the
United States more than $50 billion over the next decade. Some of you
have also argued that increasing the use of biosimilar drugs would help
lower drugs costs for consumers and taxpayers. What is delaying the
uptake of biosimilar drugs in the United States? What policies do you
recommend to increase the development of biosimilar drugs?
Answer. BMS does not have a biosimilar or a branded product with
biosimilar competition, and consequently, is not in a position to offer
first-hand insight.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
Question. The United States is one of the only countries in the
world to allow prescription drug manufacturers to advertise directly to
consumers through magazines, billboards, radio, and television
commercials. While I will not argue that it is beneficial to educate
consumers about an unfamiliar disease and encourage them to seek
medical help, most commercials from all of your companies recommend
asking about a specific brand name drug, not a medical condition.
Furthermore, even if your advertisements follow all FDA rules and list
medication side effects, they also almost always list these while a
smiling, apparently healthy person is walking on a beach.
Researchers say that this type of imagery, combined with viewing
hours of drug commercials each month, leads consumers to underestimate
the risks associated with medications. For the past decade, studies
have shown that aggressive direct-to-consumer advertising is associated
with rising drug prices and an increase in inappropriate drug
prescriptions.
Question. Since researchers have concluded that consumers are
misunderstanding the benefits and risks described in your ads, what
further policies could help you and your colleagues ensure that you are
educating patients in a clear manner?
Answer. BMS engages in DTC TV advertising selectively and only when
we think it will help educate patients. Our DTC TV advertising is
submitted to the FDA for advisory comments prior to being broadcast in
accordance with FDA guidance. BMS believes that our DTC advertising
clearly and appropriately communicates the benefits and risks of our
medicines.
BMS believes responsible DTC communications play a critical role in
educating patients and families about treatment options and encourages
them to have an informed discussion with their physician about the best
treatment for their needs. BMS would be open to considering any
additional policy proposals that further facilitate the achievement of
this goal.
pharmaceutical companies continue to raise prices
Question. As you are well aware, high prescription drug prices are
the number one concern for Americans and their families. According to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average
American spends around $1,208 annually on prescription drugs. There
have been several instances where brand name or even generic drugs that
have been on the market for years continue to increase in price.
One of the most well-known examples is Mylan's increase of the
price of EpiPen from less than $100 in 2007 to more than $600 in 2016.
Another example, is the ever-increasing price of insulin. Sanofi
increased the price of a vial of Lantus from $88.20 in 2007 to $307.20
in 2017. And those are just a small sample of price increases.
Why don't we see price decreases for drugs that have been on the
market for years without new formulations or added benefit?
Answer. Although list prices for a drug without new formulations or
added benefits may not decrease over time, in our experience, net
prices generally decrease over time and/or volume decreases
significantly as generics enter the market.
pay for delay
Question. Pay for delay is a tactic that more and more branded drug
manufacturers have been using to stifle competition from lower-cost
generic manufacturers. This allows you to sidestep competition by
offering patent settlements that pay generic companies not to bring
lower-cost alternatives to market.
These ``pay-for-delay'' patent settlements benefit both brand-name
pharmaceutical companies by helping them avoid costly patent litigation
and general manufacturers by rewarding them a hefty sum to delay
entering the market with a cheaper drug alternative. However, these
deals do not benefit consumers. According to an FTC study, these
anticompetitive deals cost consumers and taxpayers $3.5 billion in
higher drug costs every year.
Does your company partake in pay-for-delay settlements?
Answer. No.
Question. Why would a pharmaceutical company enter into a pay-for
delay agreement?
Answer. As stated above, BMS does not enter into any pay-for-delay
settlements. We cannot comment on the actions and motivations of other
manufacturers.
Question. Do you think these agreements stifle competition and
prevent generic alternatives to your branded medications?
Answer. BMS agrees that patent settlement agreements that have
substantial payments going from innovators to generics, and are solely
intended to delay competition, are anticompetitive. In contrast,
agreements that do not contain such substantial payments and properly
balance litigation considerations often lead to earlier generic entry
than patent expiration.
drug rebate rule
Question. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services'
(HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) promulgated a new regulation to
remove regulatory safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback
Statute (AKS) for rebates on prescription drugs rebates paid by
manufactures to PBMs under Medicare Part D and for Medicaid managed
care organizations (MCOs). The OIG proposal attempts to ban most
rebates by eliminating their regulatory protections.
The rule is predicted to increase net drug costs in its early
years. The CMS actuaries estimate it would cost $196 billion over 10
years. Despite this high price tag, the beneficiary benefits are
limited. The proposed rule notes that under the CMS Actuary's analysis,
the majority of beneficiaries would see an increase in their total out-
of-pocket payments and premium costs; reductions in total cost sharing
will exceed total premium increases.
I wanted to ask a question about the administration's rebate rule,
which I understand that many of the drug manufacturers, and your main
trade association, strongly support. According to an analysis of the
rule by the Office of Actuaries at CMS, drug manufacturers are likely
to initially retain 15 percent of the current rebates as higher net
drug prices.
Given that estimate, can you provide the committee with any
assurances that prices will not increase under this proposed rule?
Answer. BMS supports HHS's proposed rule because BMS believes it
will lower patient costs at the point-of-sale and ensure patients
realize the benefit of manufacturer discounts. We do not anticipate
that manufacturer average net prices will increase as a result of this
rule.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
Question. According to an article recently published in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, medical marketers spent nearly $30
billion dollars in 2016, up from $17 billion in 1997. Direct-to-
Consumer (DTC) advertising had the biggest percentage increase: from
$2.1 billion, or 11.9 percent of all medical marketing, in 1997 to $9.6
billion, or 32 percent of total spending, in 2016.
Can you please provide what your ratio of spending on sales and
marketing to research and development is today?
Answer. BMS does not disclose sales and marketing investments
separately. In 2018, BMS marketing, selling and administrative expenses
were $4.6 billion, which is inclusive of sales and marketing, and R&D
expenses were $6.3 billion. That ratio is approximately 7 to 10.
price-gouging
Question. Sanofi, as I understand it, has made a pledge to the
public to limit its price increases to the national health expenditures
growth projection.
Would your company commit to a cap on annual price increases as
part of your PhRMA membership criteria?
Answer. It is BMS's understanding that a cap on annual price
increases as part of PhRMA membership would raise significant antitrust
concerns.
Question. What policies would you propose to help ensure lower
launch prices for new drugs?
Answer. BMS does not believe that government policies should govern
launch pricing of new drugs. Payers, providers, patients, and the
marketplace should freely assess the value of new innovative therapies
relative to their improvement in outcomes and impact to total cost of
care. At BMS, we believe the prices of our medicines reflect the value
they bring to patients, healthcare providers, payers, and society as a
whole.
transparency
Question. In many of your testimonies, you mentioned that the
current system of pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) back-end rebates do
not rarely results in a scenario where the PBM passes on savings to
consumers at the point of sale (POS). The administration recently
proposed a rule to eliminate the anti-kickback statute safe harbor
protections for these drug rebates.
Do you agree that greater transparency should be required to
understand how manufacturers and PBMs are negotiating prices and
rebates to ensure that savings are passed down to beneficiaries?
Answer. Yes, BMS agrees that manufacturer's net prices should be
transparent to and passed through to beneficiaries. BMS also believes
that this transparency should be required for all entities in the
health-care market.
pbms
Question. An Axios article from March 7, 2019 highlights the fact
that, while ``pharmaceutical companies put a lot of the blame for high
drug prices on pharmacy benefit managers,'' many large pharmaceutical
companies ``rely on PBMs to manage their own health care benefits.''
In your role as an employer, does your company contract with a
pharmaceutical benefit manager (PBM) to administer the prescription
drug benefits for your employees and negotiate lower drug costs on your
behalf?
Answer. Yes.
Question. For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the
prescription drug benefit for your employees, how do you utilize the
rebates your PBM negotiates to lower health care costs or drug costs
for your employee plans and what does your company do with that
savings? Specifically, do the savings go toward lowing premiums?
Answer. BMS uses a PBM for our self-funded Pharmacy Benefit
Program, which is part of our overall healthcare plan. The PBM offers
the option of direct point-of-sale rebates, however, based on the
contract negotiated with the PBM, BMS has elected to reinvest the
rebates we would otherwise have received from the PBM to reduce the per
claim cost for brand drugs. Under this reinvested model those rebate
dollars are applied to reduce the negotiated rate our enrollees pay for
branded drugs. This means that the PBM charges the plan a lower
negotiated rate for all branded drugs (not just those associated with
specific rebates). Since our health plan benefit design uses a
coinsurance for beneficiary cost sharing, this lower negotiated drug
cost enabled by the application of the rebate value, reduces the
coinsurance amount our members pay for their medications at the
pharmacy counter. Under this model, a greater number of participants
benefit from the value of the rebates.
Question. For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the
prescription drug benefit for your employees, does your PBM offer
point-of-sale rebates to your employees?
Answer. Please see answer to previous question.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse
Question. Please describe any policy changes you support that would
result in your company lowering the list prices of its drugs.
Answer. BMS supports the HHS proposed rule to eliminate safe harbor
protection for back-end rebates in Medicare Part D, and we believe it
would lead to lower out-of-pocket costs. The goals of the proposed rule
could be achieved through lower list prices, negotiated discounts at
the point-of-sale, or some combination of these two approaches. While
it is unclear how Part D plans and PBMs will react to the proposed
rule, at this time, BMS envisions that we would offer point-of-sale
discounts to Part D plans equivalent to the contracted rebate amount
and will continue to assess the possibility of lowering list price on a
product-by-product basis. Our ability to lower list prices, however, is
constrained by the fact that the HHS proposed rule does not apply to
the commercial insurance market, where we anticipate back-end rebates
to continue for the foreseeable future.
Question. How much does your company's research and development
portfolio rely on taxpayer-funded research conducted by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH)? How many of your company's products are
based, at least in part, on NIH research, and how many are the result
of research funded solely by your company?
Answer. Government institutions such as NIH and NCI do critically
important basic research. However, the most significant investment
behind any molecule is the clinical development program, which is
usually when a pharmaceutical company comes into the development
process. On average it takes 10 to 15 years and about $2.5 B to bring a
medicine to patients, depending on the asset, therapeutic area, number
of indications, and other factors. This is highly dependent on the
stage of the molecule/asset when it comes to BMS. There is also
considerable risk of failure given the complexity of clinical
development. Only about 12 percent of drugs that make it to Phase 1
clinical trials result in an approved product.
Question. In each of the last 5 years, how much has your company
spent on research and development versus the advertising and marketing
of your products?
Answer. BMS does not publicly disclose specific advertising and
marketing expenditures. The figures below are for marketing, sales and
administrative expenses, which includes advertising and marketing
expenditures.
2018 spend:
Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses: $4.6 billion
Research and development expenses: $6.3 billion
2017 spend:
Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses: $4.8 billion
Research and development expenses: $6.5 billion
2016 spend:
Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses: $5.0 billion
Research and development expenses: $5.0 billion
2015 spend:
Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses: $4.8 billion
Research and development expenses: $5.9 billion
2014 spend:
Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses: $4.8 billion
Research and development expenses: $4.5 billion
Question. During the hearing, you mentioned that your company would
be likely to lower the list prices of its drugs if the recent proposal
by the Trump administration to change the current system of rebates was
extended to the private market.
If the policy was extended to the private market, how large would
the list price reductions be relative to the size of the rebates your
company is currently providing?
Answer. While it is unclear how health plans and PBMs would react
if the HHS proposed rule's policy were extended to the private market,
at this time, BMS envisions that we generally would offer point-of-sale
discounts to health plans equivalent on average to the contracted
rebate amount and would continue to assess the possibility of lowering
list price on a product-by-product basis. In the absence of list price
reductions, the policy requirement that manufacturer discounts be
passed on at the point-of-sale would accomplish the goal of reducing
patient out-of-pocket costs.
Question. How will this proposal affect how your company sets the
list prices for new drug products?
If the proposal is finalized and not extended to the private
market, will your company make any list price reductions? If so, how
large would the reductions be relative to the size of the rebates your
company is currently providing?
Answer. While it is unclear how health plans and PBMs would react
if the HHS proposed rule were finalized and not extended to the private
market, at this time, BMS envisions that we would offer point-of-sale
discounts to Part D plans equivalent on average to the contracted
rebate amount and would continue to assess the possibility of lowering
list price on a product-by-product basis. In the absence of a list
price reduction, the proposed rule's requirement that manufacturer
discounts be passed through to patients at the point-of-sale would
accomplish the goal of reducing patient out-of-pocket costs.

Question Submitted by Hon. Maggie Hassan
Question. In June of 2018, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access
Commission (MACPAC) unanimously recommended under Recommendation 1.1 in
their annual report to Congress that Congress remove the statutory
requirement that manufacturers blend the average manufacturer price
(AMP) of a brand drug and its authorized generic.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ MACPAC, ``Improving Operations of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program,'' https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Improving-
Operations-of-the-Medicaid-Drug-Rebate-Program.pdf.
This requirement created an unintended loophole. Rather than use
the price of the authorized generic, drug companies can sell its
authorized generic to a corporate subsidiary at an artificially lower
price, and use that lower price to bring down the AMP, which in turn
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
lowers the rebate obligation.
Does your company engage in this practice? Has your company ever
engaged in this practice in the past?
Answer. No. BMS does not have any authorized generics with its own
corporate subsidiary.

Answer. BMS believes it is important to ensure generics are made
available whenever that is permissible under our system, and supports
the administration's focus on increasing the approval of generics. As
part of that system, it is important that generic companies perform the
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
needed testing to ensure product quality and patient safety.
Until the transaction closes, BMS and Celgene will continue to
operate as separate companies. BMS thus does not know and cannot
comment on Celgene's practices as they relate to generic manufacturers.
Once the transaction closes, BMS' practices with regard to generic
manufacturers, including the provision of samples, will govern the
combined portfolio.
Question. As a portion of your revenue, for what percentage of the
drugs in your portfolio do you offer no rebates? Based on the drugs in
your pipeline, do you foresee that portion growing? For those drugs is
your list price equal to your net price?
Answer. Although the level of rebates varies by product and
channel, BMS pays rebates for all products in our portfolio.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you generate in US sales
revenue? Please include specific figures.
Answer. BMS invested $6.3 billion in R&D in 2018, which includes
the discovery and development of new medicines.
U.S. sales for 2018 were $12.5 billion.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
administration? What company functions do you consider to be included
in administration? Please include specific figures.
Answer. BMS does not publicly disclose specific marketing and
administration expenditures. The figures below are for marketing, sales
and administrative expenses, which includes marketing and
administration expenditures.
2018 spend:
Marketing, selling, and administrative expenses: $4.6 billion
Research and development expenses: $6.3 billion

Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
sales? What company functions do you consider to be included in sales?
Please include specific figures.
Answer. BMS does not publicly disclose the functions included in
sales nor specific marketing and sales expenditures. Please see the
answer to the prior question for R&D and marketing, selling and
administrative expenses.
Question. Why do you advertise for the drugs you manufacture? What
factors do you consider in choosing which drugs you advertise?
Answer. BMS believes responsible DTC communications plays a
critical role in educating patients and families about treatment
options, and encourages them to have an informed discussion with their
physician about the best treatment for their needs. As a company, BMS
engages in DTC TV advertising selectively and only when we think it
will help educate patients. Currently BMS is engaging in DTC TV
advertising for one product (Eliquis).

Prepared Statement of Kenneth C. Frazier, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer, Merck and Company, Inc.
Mr. Chairman, Senator Wyden, and members of the committee, thank
you for the opportunity to appear today. Merck's mission is to save and
improve lives around the world by bringing forward breakthrough
medicines and vaccines, and ensuring they are available and affordable
to patients who need them.
Merck is a science-based company that exists to help solve the
world's most vexing medical challenges. We have a long history of doing
this, from the development of most of the common childhood vaccines, to
bringing the first protease inhibitor to patients, turning AIDS from a
death sentence to a chronic disease, to developing the first statin,
which led to significant reductions in the negative health effects of
high cholesterol. This legacy of invention continues today.
Research is at the core of who we are and what we do. Last year,
Merck invested nearly $10 billion in research and development toward
our mission of preventing, treating, and curing disease, and since 2010
we've invested nearly $70 billion in these efforts. Our more than
12,000 researchers are focused on cancer, infectious diseases, and
Alzheimer's, as well as other major health challenges that affect large
numbers of people around the world. For our breakthrough immuno-
oncology drug Keytruda alone we have over 900 clinical trials under
way.
In pursuit of these efforts, we are also investing significantly in
infrastructure here in the United States. We have invested more than $5
billion in the last five years, and we plan to invest $9 billion more
over the next few years to increase manufacturing capacity and open two
new discovery research centers.
Our mission is to go where the science leads us, which means we
don't allocate resources only to addressing diseases in wealthy
countries; we focus our efforts on conditions that significantly impact
people living all over the world.
For instance, we are proud to have deployed 70,000 doses of our
experimental Ebola vaccine in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,
working in partnership with the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority,
and the Department of Health and Human Services. For efforts such as
this there is no commercial opportunity, but we pursue them because
these are the challenges that Merck was created to tackle.
At the end of the day we do all of this to serve patients. We
understand that patients are having a harder and harder time affording
their health care, including their prescription medicines. As a result
of robust negotiation and competition in the marketplace, medicine
costs are growing at the slowest rate in years, but the system is still
not working for patients who are too often being asked to pay more out-
of-pocket due to the complex system of pricing, distribution, and
insurance. I am here today to suggest a few ways that we can address
this problem together.
First, we want to be clear that our industry has a duty to be
responsible in our pricing practices and contribute to solutions that
address the affordability problems facing patients. We have all heard
the egregious examples of irresponsible behavior. At Merck, we have a
history of responsible pricing. To help increase transparency about our
pricing practices, we publicly disclose information about our prices in
the U.S. and the rebates and discounts we provide to payers--including
insurers, pharmacy benefit managers, and the government. Last year, we
pledged that we will not increase our average net prices for our
portfolio by more than the rate of inflation annually.
From 2010 to 2017, Merck's average net price increase across our
portfolio each year has been in the low to mid-single digits. In fact,
our average net price declined in 2017 by almost 2 percent. In 2017,
the average discount for our medicines and vaccines was more than 45
percent lower than the list price. Despite these very large discounts,
patients do not see a commensurate benefit. In fact, patient out-of-
pocket costs continue to rise, and patients are being asked to shoulder
more of their drug costs than other health-care services.
Second, we must ensure that patients get the benefit of the large
rebates and discounts that manufacturers are paying to PBMs and
insurance companies.
The incentives in the current system are badly misaligned. As a
result, the current system of drug competition that depends on rebating
is not working for patients. The growing gap between our list prices
and our net prices that results from rebating has created incentives
for supply chain entities to favor products with higher list prices.
For instance, in 2016, we introduced our hepatitis C therapy, Zepatier,
at a list price that was 42 percent below the price of the therapy that
was the standard of care. However, due to the misaligned incentives in
the supply chain that create a preference for higher priced products,
we had difficulty gaining access for patients in certain market
segments.
This kind of misalignment can have a significant negative impact on
patients because their cost-sharing is often based on the list price of
a drug, even when insurance companies and PBMs are paying a fraction of
that price. Our current system that incentivizes high list prices and
large rebates as a mechanism to keep insurance premiums low means that
sick patients are essentially subsidizing healthy patients. In this
way, our insurance system is broken. We urge you to support action to
make sure that all patients benefit from the discounts we make
available.
Third, we can significantly reduce spending on pharmaceuticals,
especially for patients, by ensuring that we have a viable market for
biosimilars in the United States. We believe, like with traditional
small molecule medicines, generic competition after a reasonable period
of exclusivity will create headroom for patients to afford the newest,
most innovative medicines. Research shows that generics and biosimilars
are expected to drive savings of $105 billion through 2022 in the
U.S.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ IQVIA Institute for Human Data Science. ``Medicine use and
spending in the U.S.: A review of 2017 and outlook to 2022.'' https://
www.iqvia.com/institute/reports/medicine-use-and-spending-in-the-us-
review-of-2017-outlook-to-2022. Published April 19, 2018. Accessed
April 2018.
However, we share the concerns expressed by FDA Commissioner
Gottlieb regarding the challenges biosimilars have experienced in
penetrating the market. Merck introduced a biosimilar to the market 18
months ago at a 35 percent discount to the originator product, yet we
have captured only a tiny fraction of the market. In general,
biosimilars competition thus far has resulted in moderation of prices,
but actual utilization of the biosimilars remains modest at best. We
fear that an environment where market entry of biosimilars brings value
to the market, but little or none of that value accrues to the
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
biosimilar, will not be sustainable.
Therefore, we urge Congress to pursue policies to encourage and
support biosimilar uptake and utilization in order to realize these
potential savings for the system and patients. These could include
reduced cost sharing in Medicare Part B.
Fourth, we believe that prices can more align with a drug's value
when manufacturers and payers are able to negotiate innovative
contracts that base payment on a drug's benefits. Manufacturers should
be rewarded based on the value that our therapies deliver. When we
developed our breakthrough immuno-oncology treatment Keytruda, we
incorporated a biomarker where clinically appropriate so that we could
identify those patients most likely to benefit, but this is not always
the case. We did this because we believe in giving the right medicine
to the right patient at the right time. This is important both for
therapeutic and economic reasons. If patients regularly take our
medicines as they are prescribed, we are prepared to stand behind their
effectiveness.
Moving to a system where we are reimbursed for the value our
medicines provide would be revolutionary. Yet there remain major
regulatory and operational obstacles to value-based payment and
contracting in the commercial and public markets, which we urge
Congress to address.
Fifth, we support efforts to encourage generic competition. A
version of Chairman Grassley's CREATES Act could make some needed
reforms to encourage generic competition, and there are likely other
policies we should consider as well to ensure there is no inappropriate
gaming of the system.
We also support the idea of eliminating the use of drug company
coupons in cases where a brand name drug now has generic competition.
This slows the use of generics and violates the spirit of the Hatch-
Waxman drug price competition law.
Finally, we would also like to work with the committee to find ways
to end the price gouging pursued by those who jack up the prices of
off-patent drugs that have no competition. These high prices hurt
patients and do not create incentives for the kind of cutting edge
research we pursue.
These six changes could bring real relief to patients while
preserving the incentives that allow us to invest billions in
developing new medicines. These are exciting times, when decades of
investment in scientific research are yielding life-changing
discoveries. But it is the investment of today that fuels the
innovations of tomorrow, and if we damage the ecosystem that drives
those investments, we'll never know what we could have achieved for the
patients we are all here to serve.
The single most important contribution that we make at Merck--to
economies, to health care, and to individual patients and their
families--is to continue making the necessary costly and long-term
investments in R&D and persuading thousands of brilliant researchers to
sit at a lab bench and try to create something transformative--despite
the overwhelming odds that their efforts will not succeed, since 9 out
of 10 compounds that even start clinical trials will fail.
The solutions to health-care spending and out-of-pocket costs for
patients must be achieved in a way that provides the balance necessary
for innovation to occur. The innovation ecosystem includes academia,
small biotechnology companies, large pharmaceutical companies,
government, and patients and providers. It is incumbent on all of us to
solve the affordability challenges of today's patients without
compromising our ability to invent for tomorrow's patients.
I'd like to end on a personal note. My mother died when I was a
child and my siblings and I were raised by my dad who worked as a
janitor in North Philadelphia. He was a giant in my life and it was
devastating when Alzheimer's took him away from me and my family.
Last year, after spending many years and over a billion dollars,
Merck had to end development of a promising new Alzheimer's therapy
because it simply didn't work. Yet we continue on, seeking better
approaches. And I truly believe Merck or one of the other companies at
this table can and will find a medicine that will ensure that no one
will have to experience the pain of seeing a loved one taken from them
in this way.
But, our success depends on having a U.S. market that is free,
competitive, and predictable. The changes I've discussed today have the
potential to vastly improve that market and help patients survive and
thrive without financial hardship. I am here to pledge our cooperation
with you for creating such changes.
Thank you.

Questions Submitted for the Record to Kenneth C. Frazier
Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
Question. At the hearing, you testified that Merck does not
withhold samples from generic manufacturers in order to block generic
versions of your drug from entering the market. You also expressed your
support for the ``Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent
Samples Act,'' also known as the CREATES Act.
However, the FDA has a list on its website which identifies
reference listed drug (RLD) access inquiries where brand manufacturers
may have prevented generic companies from obtaining samples of products
necessary to support FDA approval. Cubist Pharmaceuticals is on this
FDA list. According to news reports, Merck bought this company in 2014.
If this is accurate, this would appear to contradict your testimony at
the hearing that Merck has not withheld samples of their products to
delay generic competition.
Could you please explain in detail the discrepancy between your
testimony and the FDA list?
Has Merck ever blocked access to samples?
Answer. Merck does not block generic companies from accessing
samples. Your inquiry references FDA's website for reference listed
drugs, or RLDs, which lists inquiries the agency has received from
potential generic companies for samples of RLDs. Importantly, FDA's
website also provides the following statement in describing the various
inquiries related to the RLDs listed: ``We note that FDA has not
independently investigated or confirmed the access limitations
described in the inquiries received.''
As FDA's website details, ENTEREG (alvimopan) has a restricted
distribution requirement mandated by its FDA-approved Risk Evaluation
and Mitigation Strategy (REMS). ENTEREG is the only Merck product
subject to an FDA-approved REMS. Under this program, ENTEREG is
available only to hospitals that perform surgeries that include a bowel
resection and dispensed by pharmacies that are enrolled in the E.A.S.E.
ENTEREG REMS Program. This program is designed to ensure that ENTEREG
is used in accordance with the FDA-approved label.
Merck acquired ENTEREG from Cubist Pharmaceuticals in 2015. Since
acquiring ENTEREG, whenever Merck has received a request from a
generics company to supply ENTEREG, we have directed them to the draft
FDA Guidance which outlines how the generics company can obtain a
letter from FDA stating that their study protocols contain the
appropriate safety protections for products subject to this type of
REMS. If provided with a copy of such a letter from FDA, Merck is happy
to work with generics companies on supply arrangements. To date, we
have not received any such letters. FDA's website also details that the
agency has not issued any Safety Determination Letters for samples of
ENTEREG.
Question. The Department of Health and Human Services' proposed
rule, ``Fraud and Abuse; Removal of Safe Harbor Protection for Rebates
Involving Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Creation of New Safe Harbor
Protection for Certain Point-of-Sale Reductions in Price on
Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Certain Pharmacy Benefit Manager
Service Fees,'' envisions that drug manufacturers will offer up-front
discounts rather than the back-end rebates that are now commonly
provided. Some observers argue that a 1996 court case called into
question whether manufacturers could offer up-front discounts,
resulting in today's rebate-based system. I've heard differing opinions
as to whether the issues related to the initial court case are still
relevant. If the HHS proposed rule is finalized, can you assure the
committee that your company will offer up-front discounts? If not, why?
Answer. Merck is aware that some in the industry have asked whether
the antitrust laws as interpreted in the In re Brand Name Prescription
Drugs Antitrust Litigation would limit the ability of manufacturers to
offer point-of-sale discounts (as opposed to rebates). But, the U.S.
antitrust laws, including the Robinson-Patman Act, apply to price
discrimination in any context (including rebates), and nothing about In
re Brand Name Prescription Drugs Antitrust Litigation changes this
fact. As a result, Merck commits that, if the OIG's Proposed Rule is
finalized, we will modify our contracts to comply with the new safe
harbors and will provide discounts in a manner consistent with the new
regulations.
Question. Please describe how you expect your company to respond to
the HHS proposed rule to eliminate safe harbor protection for back-end
rebates in Medicare Part D that is referenced above if it is finalized.
Assuming you are confident that antitrust laws do not prevent your
company from offering up-front discounts, specifically, do you envision
that your company lowers the list price of a drug to the current after-
rebate net price, offer discounts equal to the current rebate amount,
or a combination of both?
Answer. We expect that the robust negotiations that occur today
will continue in the highly competitive Part D market, and we expect to
realize the same level of net price that we do today. In fact, we
expect that there could be additional pricing pressure under the new
system, which could lead to lower net prices.
Over time, we expect that our list prices will go down if the
misaligned incentives across the system are addressed. We are currently
working with other stakeholders in the system to solve the operational
challenges that will enable these changes.
But, it is also important to note that if the rule is implemented,
Medicare beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs will be reduced,
independent of any lowering of list prices, since their cost-sharing
will be based on the net price. Nonetheless, we believe the rebate rule
will align incentives in a way that will restrain list prices.
If this rule is implemented as written, it would only apply to our
contracts with PBMs and health plans for Medicare Part D and Managed
Medicaid. If PBMs and health plans maintain the rebate model in the
commercial market, we would still have commercial contracts based on
rebates, which would be subject to the existing constraints to lowering
list price. We also would still need a mechanism to revalue drug in the
distribution channel in a financially viable manner.
Question. To what extent are the back-end rebates your company
currently offers contingent on the amount of market share realized for
your drugs as a result of Part D plan formulary placement and other
techniques?
Answer. Our contracts typically provide rebates to Part D plans in
exchange for a specified formulary status. We are aware of only one
current agreement that makes a Part D rebate contingent on reaching a
certain market share.
Question. Please provide a breakdown of percentage of sales that go
to each payer (including Medicare, Medicaid, private pay, other) and a
similar percentage by volume of the total number of each drug compared
to total volume. Please provide this data for the most recent year
available.
Answer. The table below provides a proxy for volume by reporting
percentages based on gross sales from 2018, given that there is no
standard unit of volume measure that can be applied across our diverse
product line (e.g., tablet products, injectable products, vaccines).
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes: CML refers to private commercial payers; Medicare Part B
also encompasses Part B products sold through Medicare
Advantage Plans; Medicaid includes fee for service and managed
Medicaid; Federal includes the VA, DoD, Coast Guard, Public
Health Service and other similar purchasers.
Question. Do your companies hire consultants or lobbyists to
promote products at State Medicaid Pharmacy and Therapeutics
Committees?
Answer. No. While Merck does contract with lobbyists who may
interact with individuals associated with State Medicaid programs, they
do not promote products at State Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees.
Question. To whom do you disclose advocacy activities surrounding
State Medicaid programs, if at all?
Answer. Merck requires employees to adhere to State ethics law
requirements for disclosing advocacy activity. Additionally, employees
who attend Medicaid program meetings must comply with State public
meeting law requirements pertaining to their attendance and
participation.
Question. Please describe how the costs of patient assistance
programs are accounted for within your company's financial statements.
Please also describe the types of market information, such as
prescribing and use patterns, that your company collects from different
types of patient assistance programs and patient hub services.
Answer. For purposes of this question, we are interpreting
``patient assistance programs'' to include the Merck Patient Assistance
Program (Merck PAP), which provides free product to qualifying
patients, Merck donations to independent patient assistance
foundations, and Merck's patient coupon programs which help eligible
privately insured patients afford their prescribed medications. Merck
also makes available patient hub support programs to assist patients
with accessing their prescribed medications.
With respect to the company's financial statements, for Merck PAP
and Merck's donations to independent patient assistance foundations,
the costs are recorded to the ``Selling, general and administrative''
category on our Consolidated Statement of Income. The co-pay assistance
made available to patients through Merck's coupon programs is treated
as a reduction to Merck's gross sales for the applicable products and
is included in the ``Sales'' line of our Consolidated Statement of
Income. The expenses associated with administering Merck's coupon
programs are recorded in the ``Selling, general and administrative''
category on our Consolidated Statement of Income. Similarly, the
expenses associated with administering Merck's patient hub support
programs are recorded in the ``Selling, general and administrative''
category of our Consolidated Statement of Income.
Merck receives different types of market information in connection
with the different programs identified above. For market information
associated with the Merck PAP, the Merck PAP reviews data, such as
patient insurance status and household income, to determine an
individual's eligibility for PAP program enrollment. Merck PAP also
tracks the number of prescriptions associated with the PAP for
budgeting and planning purposes, but Merck PAP does not collect
information associated with the courses of therapy for individual
patients. With respect to Merck's donations to independent patient
assistance foundations Merck does not receive any market information.
Merck receives only a final report that confirms donations were
received and spent in their totality for their intended purpose.
With respect to Merck's patient coupon programs, Merck may receive
certain market information to assist it with evaluating whether its
coupons programs are functioning consistent with their intended purpose
and whether the vendor is meeting its contractual obligations. The
information also may be used to assist Merck with budgeting and
planning. For example, Merck may receive information about: the product
filled; the product dispensing date and site; the prescriber; the
number of patients enrolled in the coupon program; the number of
coupons redeemed; the patient out-of-pocket costs associated with the
use of a Merck coupon; and the benefit amount Merck pays on behalf of
privately-insured patients using a coupon.
With respect to Merck's patient hub support programs, Merck may
receive certain market information to assist it with evaluating whether
its hub support programs are functioning consistent with their intended
purpose and whether the vendor is meeting its contractual obligations.
The information also may be used to assist Merck with budgeting and
planning. For example, Merck may receive aggregate information about:
call type, frequency, and vendor response times; the number of patients
enrolled in the program; patient enrollment demographic and diagnosis
information; patient benefit investigations; insurance coverage
information for the applicable product; and pharmacy product
fulfillment information.
Merck's third-party contractors may receive additional, patient-
specific information that is not shared directly with Merck.
Question. Please provide a list of all contributions since January
1, 2014, that your company has made to any tax-exempt organizations
working on issues related to drugs within your product lines, including
but not limited to patient groups, disease awareness groups, medical or
professional societies, universities or hospitals, industry
associations or leagues. For each contribution, please provide the name
of the organization that received the donation, the date the donation
was made, the amount of the donation, and a description of the purpose
of the contribution (i.e., was the contribution for the general fund, a
specific purpose to a specific program, or continuing medical
education). Please also note whether the contribution was unrestricted
or restricted; if it was restricted, please explain all restrictions.
Finally, if your company maintains a foundation or other separate
charitable arm, please provide the name of all such entities, and list
all donations made from that entity or entities.
Answer. The information concerning our Philanthropic grants and
charitable contributions, including contributions made through the
Office of Corporate Responsibility, our company's Foundation, U.S.
Global Human Health, and the MSD for Mothers Program can be found here:
https://www.msdresponsibility.com/ethics-transparency/transparency-
disclosures/. Please note the website does not include grants or
contributions from Merck's Research Laboratories or Merck's
Manufacturing Division.
In addition, the information concerning our grants of more than
$500 provided by the company's Global Human Health division to U.S.
organizations in support of independent, accredited educational
programs for health-care professionals, as well as grants to patient
organizations and other medical education or scientific societies and
organizations in the United States, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and
Canada can also be found at the website referenced above.
Question. Pay for delay agreements cost consumers and taxpayers
billions in higher drug costs every year. The FTC has gone after drug
companies that enter into these settlements where the brand pays the
generic company to keep its lower cost alternative off the market. I'm
the lead Republican sponsor of S. 64, the Preserve Access to Affordable
Generics and Biosimilars Act, which would help put an end to these
deals.
Do you agree that these pay-off agreements keep drug costs high for
patients because they delay competition?
Answer. Patent settlement agreements challenged by the FTC as anti-
competitive, in which brands pay generic companies to stay out of the
market when it would otherwise be lawful for them to enter the market,
could delay patient access to lower cost alternatives. In contrast,
patent settlement agreements in which the brand, while not conceding
the invalidity or non-infringement of the patents, but in the face of
the uncertainties and costs associated with protracted litigation,
settles cases in a manner that allows a generic to enter the market
prior to expiry of the brand's patents could actually accelerate
patient access to lower cost alternatives. Still, brands do not enter
into such agreements lightly because they believe in the rights of
patent holders to vigorously enforce their intellectual property rights
in court. At the end of the day, these settlements do not delay entry
or cause the loss of any lawful competition because entry prior to the
expiry of these patents would be unlawful infringement unless and until
the generic manufacturers prevailed in court.
Question. Has your company ever entered into these kinds of
settlements with a generic company?
Answer. Merck has not entered into patent settlement agreements
with generic companies to delay their entry past when it would
otherwise be lawful for them to enter the market. Merck has been party
to a number of patent settlement agreements that provide for generic
market entry prior to patent expiry, including some that have provided
some level of exclusivity for a limited time. These agreements allowed
generic products to enter the market earlier than would have otherwise
been the case. The FTC has not challenged as anti-competitive any of
these types of agreements involving Merck.
Question. Do you support the pay for delay bill?
Answer. Merck does not support S. 64 in its present form. Merck
believes that the development of the law through the judicial process
is the most effective way to address the balance between antitrust law
and patent law raised by settlement agreements. S. 64 upsets the
careful balance embodied in a rule-of-reason analysis by creating a
presumption that ``anything of value'' or an ``exclusive license'' are
anticompetitive, thus denying an antitrust defendant the ability to
present and rely on countervailing evidence of pro-competitive effects,
such as the impact on competition by the entry of the generic product
before the expiration of the patent or statutory exclusivity term. As
noted by the Supreme Court in FTC v. Actavis:
Given these factors, it would be incongruous to determine
antitrust legality by measuring the settlement's
anticompetitive effects solely against patent law policy,
rather than by measuring them against procompetitive antitrust
policies as well.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ FTC v. Actavis, 570 U.S. 136, 148 (2013).
S. 64 also seeks to insulate the FTC's fact finding from judicial
review. Finally, the retroactive application of the provisions of the
bill to June 2013 is unworkable. While there had been a split between
the Circuit Courts over the proper analysis of reverse payment
settlements, the Supreme Court's opinion in Actavis in 2013 settled
that split by holding that patent settlements including those with
reverse payments were subject to a rule-of-reason analysis. That
decision did not provide hard and fast rules for the balance between
antitrust and patent principles. To impose a process that alters that
balance, and to do so retroactively, is imprudent and unfair.
rebate traps/walls
Question. I'm increasingly concerned about the effect of so-called
``rebate traps'' or ``rebate walls'' on patients' access to quality,
lower cost medicine. I understand there is ongoing litigation
challenging these practices as anti-competitive.
Does your company engage in the bundling of rebates over multiple
products? If so, why? And what benefit does the consumer gain from
that?
Answer. Merck understands this question to refer to certain
concerns about contracting practices applied to contracts between
manufacturers and PBMs or health plans. Merck offers rebates to payers
on bundles of products within certain product families (e.g., JANUVIA
and JANUMET, ASMANEX TWISTHALER and ASMANEX HFA). These bundled
discounts benefit patients by ensuring that multiple therapies are
maintained on a PBM or health plan formulary, thus ensuring wider
patient access to our medicines at lower costs to the payer. Merck also
offers discounts with respect to multiple bundled products outside of
the PBM and health plan contracts, such as in the vaccine and hospital
markets.
Question. Does your company view these practices as anticompetitive
or harmful to patients' access to quality, lower cost medicine?
Answer. No. Merck believes the rebates it offers to payers on
pharmaceutical products are procompetitive. Merck does not believe that
its rebating practices are harmful to patients.
Question. If a policy were adopted to eliminate rebates, or to
require that rebate savings be passed on to the consumer, would that in
and of itself solve the issue of rebate ``traps'' and ``walls''? And
would consumers benefit from such a policy?
Answer. Merck is very supportive of current efforts to change the
system. We believe these efforts will remove misaligned incentives
within the system, drive more transparency in the system and, most
importantly, benefit patients by lowering out-of-pocket costs. It is
difficult to predict whether these changes will solve all of the issues
seen today, but Merck is committed to working toward additional
solutions if issues remain after these changes are implemented.
drug pricing
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider regulatory costs or compliance? If so, how specifically do
those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at least
one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
When setting the list price of a drug, does your company consider
the risk of liability or litigation? If so, how specifically do those
factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at least one
specific example, if applicable, from your current product portfolio.
Answer. In setting the list price for a drug, we do not
specifically consider the regulatory costs or compliance or the risk of
liability or litigation.
Merck approaches pricing from the perspective of value. This
approach looks at the value that a medicine provides through multiple
lenses with the goal of reflecting its benefit to patients and to
society, while at the same time paying an appropriate return on
invested capital to our investors, to ensure that we are able to
sustain R&D. While each individual situation varies based on factual
circumstances and market dynamics, generally, we consider:

Value provided to patients--to what extent does a new
medicine or vaccine establish a new standard of care that has
the potential to significantly extend and improve patient
lives?

Value provided to health-care systems--to what extent does a
new medicine or vaccine reduce the costs associated with
hospitalization and other costly complications of disease if
not appropriately (or optimally) treated?

Unmet need--does a new medicine or vaccine address a
critically unmet medical need, where few or no treatments
exist?

Access--what is the ability of various customers around the
world--including national, regional or local institutional
payers, physicians, employers and patients--to pay for our
products?

R&D sustainability--given the long-term risk and cost of
capital, can we appropriately compensate our investors to
ensure continued investment in the kind of risky and capital-
intensive research and development that will bring forward
medically important breakthroughs?

Competition--what are the costs of other treatments
currently on the market relative to the value provided by
Merck's products?
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Pat Roberts
Question. What role do you see value-based arrangements (VBAs)
playing in the effort to reduce prescription drug costs? What potential
do these arrangements have to find the ``sweet spot'' between
controlling costs to patients and encouraging innovation of new drugs?
How can VBAs help lower what patients pay out-of-pocket?
Can Congress do more to allow for and encourage the use of VBAs?
Answer. For more than 10 years, Merck has worked with payers and
health-care providers to advance alternative pricing and contracting
arrangements, and Merck has publicly shared information about value-
based agreements (VBAs) it entered into with the payers Aetna and
Cigna. We are continuously reviewing ways in which the company may
enter into VBAs for our products, which we define as a contractual
framework aimed at achieving a mutually agreed upon value objective
that that drives greater value from health care spending. Merck is
interested, where business and customer objectives align, to implement
VBAs across the health care market, including Medicare Part D, Managed
Medicaid, and Fee-For-Service Medicaid.
By aligning payments for medicines more directly with their value
in improving meaningful health outcomes and/or reducing the need for
other health-care services (such as hospitalizations), VBAs make
pharmaceutical manufacturers accountable for the results their products
achieve in a concrete way and can help improve patients' health and
maximize the benefits of health-care spending. A recent Avalere survey
of payers found that 44 percent of payers engaged in outcomes-based
contracts experienced improvements in patient outcomes.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Avalere Health. ``Outcomes-Based Contracts: Payer
Perspectives.'' Avalere Policy 360. July 19, 2018.
VBAs also can increase patient access to new therapies which could
ultimately improve patient outcomes. A payer that might otherwise
decline to cover a new medicine (or that would only cover the medicine
with significant utilization management restrictions or high cost
sharing) due to uncertainties about the expected percentage of its
patient population who would benefit might increase access to the
medicine if the manufacturer shared the risks of the medicine's
performance. These agreements may make medicines more accessible to
patients who will benefit from them and increase competition in
relevant therapeutic classes.\3\ Researchers have found that value-
based arrangements can improve patient access to medicines.\4\

in: Seely, E., and Kesselheim, A. ``Outcomes-Based Pharmaceutical
Contracts: An Answer to High U.S. Drug Spending?'' Commonwealth Fund.
Issue Brief. September 2017.
While Merck has had some experience with VBAs, these efforts have
not been as robust as they could be due to the challenges involved in
developing and implementing them. In addition to infrastructure and
data limitations, challenges include regulatory limitations such as
government pricing frameworks (e.g., Medicaid Best Price (BP) rules,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Medicare's Average Sales Price (ASP)) and Federal fraud and abuse laws.
Accordingly, we support opportunities that would enable greater
experimentation in the design, structure, and implementation of VBAs.
Further innovation in this space is needed to support overall sponsor
and plan learning, and to determine the range of potential benefits to
diverse health systems and beneficiaries. To fully achieve these goals,
however, the impacts of the current regulatory framework, including
government pricing requirements, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
(AKS), and overall environmental barriers, must be analyzed and
addressed as appropriate. Policy solutions such as the Patient
Affordability Value and Efficiency Act (PAVE), introduced by Senators
Warner and Cassidy, could provide necessary regulatory flexibility for
properly structured VBAs.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Michael B. Enzi
Question. More than 10 years ago, I worked on a bipartisan basis
with my good friends Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch to develop a
biosimilars approval pathway. One of the difficult things was
accounting for the differences between biosimilars and generics. I have
said before that if a drug was a three-bedroom, two-bath home, a
biologic would be a skyscraper. The size and complexity of the items
are just that different. I understand that it is much harder to build a
skyscraper without blueprints than a house. Even though the science has
come a long way since then, there aren't as many biosimilars on the
market as we might have hoped. Do you think the incentives in the law
appropriately account for the differences between biosimilars and
generics?
Answer. In general, biosimilars competition thus far has resulted
in moderation of prices, but actual utilization of the biosimilars
remains modest at best. We fear that an environment where market entry
of biosimilars brings value to the market, but little or none of that
value accrues to the biosimilar patient or the health-care system, will
not be sustainable.
Merck remains an advocate for rigorous biosimilarity standards
globally, and we believe that all biosimilar product applicants should
be required to demonstrate equivalence (i.e., biosimilarity) in safety
(including immunogenicity) and efficacy, and no differences in purity
and potency profiles between the originator reference product and the
biosimilar candidate. We believe the FDA has instituted such a standard
with its Totality of the Evidence approach, ``including structural and
functional characterization, nonclinical evaluation, human PK and PD
data, clinical immunogenicity data, and comparative clinical study(ies)
data.'' \5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ U.S. Food and Drug Administration. ``Scientific Considerations
in Demonstrating Biosimilarity to a Reference Product Guidance for
Industry.'' (Apr. 2015), https://www.fda.gov/downloads/drugs/guidances/
ucm291128.pdf.
We are urging Congress to pursue policies to encourage and support
biosimilar uptake and utilization in order to realize these potential
savings for the system and patients. These policies could include
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
reduced cost sharing in Medicare Part B.
Question. I know there are proposals to essentially pay more for
biosimilars to make them more attractive, but that is not exactly what
we were intending when we wrote the law. Can you talk about adverse
incentives in the market and any barriers to market penetration that we
might address to help improve patient access to these lower cost
products?
Answer. Merck introduced a biosimilar to the market 18 months ago
at a 35-
percent discount to the originator product, yet we have captured only a
tiny fraction of the market. Uptake of the product was limited, we
believe due to physician confusion regarding interchangeability and
extrapolation, and a lack of physician, patient, and payer incentives.
While we believe that the prescribing physician must always have the
authority to designate exactly which biological product is dispensed to
the patient, we believe there are market barriers that hamper
appropriate adoption of biosimilars. Merck encountered the following
market barriers that hampered uptake of RENFLEXIS:

We have observed cases where Medicare Advantage plans seem
to be imposing utilization management controls that require
providers to first use the reference biologic before providing
coverage for the biosimilar. This is a significant disincentive
to biosimilar uptake in that setting, and we believe is
contrary to policy objectives to promote the uptake of
biosimilars.

Some providers may be hesitant to adopt biosimilar products
due to overall confusion and the current lack of standardized
definitions of biosimilarity (including the concepts of
extrapolation and interchangeability). Currently, we lack
standardized definitions of interchangeability as it relates to
clinical significance, and concerns about the clinical
appropriateness of switching stable patients to a biosimilar
product have been contentious issues for some prescribers.
Further, prescribers may be comfortable with a single switch
(i.e., moving a stable patient from a reference product
treatment protocol to a biosimilar), but may have concerns
about switching a patient multiple times, absent the
interchangeability designation. We believe that regulatory
clarification of these terms and concepts could help mitigate
concerns for providers and support biosimilar product adoption.
We suggest the following policy changes to help encourage and
support prescriber biosimilar utilization:

Consider options to reduce or eliminate patient cost sharing
in Medicare Part B for biosimilars. While some Part B
beneficiaries are already able to reduce their 20 percent cost
sharing via supplemental coverage, we believe eliminating cost
sharing will encourage many physicians to use biosimilars for
their patients. A similar approach in Part D and in Medicaid
for small-molecule generics has driven generic utilization up

Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
Question. We continue to hear that rebates negotiated off of the
list price of a drug are both good and bad.
Pharmacy benefit managers and plans have argued that rebates are
used to lower premiums across the board and that it is the best way to
seek a price concession on otherwise expensive drugs.
Your industry argues that these payers are insisting on higher
rebates that can only be achieved by raising list prices.
But patients often lose under this system, with out of pocket costs
being tied to list price. Insulin patients appear to be routinely
impacted by this perversity in the system.
Please explain to the committee how your company would reduce list
prices if rebates were no longer a part of the equation?
What assurance can you provide that you would in fact lower your
prices?
What actions should be taken to ensure that patients are actually
seeing the benefits of lower out of pocket costs?
Answer. As we stated when we reduced the list price of several of
our products in July 2018, we will continue to look for opportunities
to reduce our list prices. We think the proposed rule will help create
those opportunities, but it can't happen overnight. We are currently
working with other stakeholders in the system to solve the operational
challenges that will enable these changes.
It is important to note that if the proposed rule is implemented,
Medicare beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs will be reduced,
independent of any lowering of list prices, since their cost-sharing
will be based on the net price. Further actions to ensure patients
actually see the benefit of lower out of pocket costs might include
prohibitions on changes in benefit design by payers/PBMs that could
allow payers/PBMs to defeat the intent of delivering savings to
patients.
Question. If rebates are driving high list prices for drugs as drug
manufacturers' claim, why do you think that Part B drugs, which have no
PBM rebates, are also seeing significant price increases? Whose fault
is that?
Answer. While the misaligned incentives of Part D are partly
responsible for PBMs favoring high list prices, that is not the sole
dynamic associated with price increases. There may be unique reasons
for price increases on specific products given their individual
circumstances, including competitive dynamics and the costs of clinical
research and manufacturing improvements. In addition, while PBMs
generally do not manage Part B benefits, this does not mean that
discounts are not provided or applied on these products. Providers and
commercial health plans do receive discounts, the average of which is
passed along to patients through ASP-based reimbursement.
The 20-percent coinsurance paid by a patient is based on the ASP,
which reflects the average discounts received by providers and payers.
biosimilar competition/insulin
Question. Biosimilars have been much anticipated as a solution to
the drug pricing crisis. In particular, the FDA is moving to make
insulin a biologic that would be subject to biosimilar competition in
the future.
But we are hearing from all of you that the biosimilar market
doesn't work and the benefit of these cheaper but equally effective
alternatives are really not available to U.S. patients.
Can a biosimilar version of insulin be part of the solution for
diabetes patients?
If so, what changes need to be made to the system so that patients
and the taxpayer can realize the benefit of biosimilars? (Merck gave up
on pursuing a biosimilar to Sanofi's Lantus \7\)

biosimilar-lantus-but-will-ease-path-for-mylan-s-rival-insulin-product.
Answer. We believe there is potential for significant savings to
national health-care systems if high quality biosimilars--including
insulins--can be brought to the market and compete with those biologics
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
that have exhausted their intellectual property protections.
Biosimilar products are still the subject of a great deal of
confusion, particularly among providers, regarding the scientific,
regulatory, and clinical basis for extrapolation and interchangeability
decisions made by the FDA. Merck has urged the FDA to expand its work
in educating providers and other stakeholders on these topics.
Beyond that, we believe Congress should consider policy changes to
help encourage and support prescriber biosimilar utilization. In our
Blueprint comments to HHS we recommended incentives targeting patients,
health plans, and providers that we believe can move the needle in
stimulating uptake. One idea is for Congress to consider options to
reduce or eliminate patient cost sharing in Medicare Part B for
biosimilars.
As to the Lantus biosimilar, after a comprehensive assessment of
the current and future market environment for insulin glargine,
including biosimilars, which included an assessment of anticipated
pricing and cost of production, we made the business decision to
terminate our agreement on the commercialization of the Lusduna pen and
vial. There is already one other biosimilar glargine on the market and
others on the way. So, we concluded this space was, or soon will be,
adequately covered. This will allow us to allocate resources to other
products in development.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
re-evaluating business strategies in foreign countries
Question. Since taking office, President Trump has made reducing
drug prices one of his highest priorities--and has repeatedly spoken
about his frustration with the U.S. subsidizing the costs of
pharmaceuticals for the rest of the world. He has gone so far as to
issue proposals, like the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model, in
an attempt to bring down prescription drug prices.
With the increased scrutiny of the industry and of the drug supply
chain as a whole in the United States, have any of your companies re-
evaluated your business strategy in foreign countries?
If not, then why?
If a proposal, like IPI, were implemented, would it force your
companies to potentially ``walk away from the negotiating table when
other countries demand low prices subsidized by America's seniors,'' as
HHS Senior Advisor for Drug Pricing Reform John O'Brien has said?
What are some of your ideas on how we can ensure Americans aren't
shouldering the full cost of pharmaceuticals?
Answer. Merck continually reevaluates its business strategies in
all markets, seeking in particular to make its vaccines and medicines
accessible to patients while realizing their full value in foreign
markets with regulatory schemes that do not recognize the full value of
these products and artificially reduce prices. Nevertheless, in most
markets there are very limited options for adjusting prices to
recognize the full value of our medicines and vaccines. One-sided and
onerous pricing and reimbursement schemes most often leave little room
for negotiation.
With regard to ``walking away from the negotiating table,'' Merck
always reserves that option. However, we recognize the serious and
negative implications on patient health and access, the company's
ultimate mission, and other possible repercussions that would result
from denying patient access to our medicines. Moreover, foreign
governments can resort to compulsory licensing, essentially seizing
patent rights, where a company refuses to market a product, which also
makes it difficult to withdraw from a foreign market.
Regarding ideas to ensure Americans aren't shouldering the full
cost of pharmaceuticals, we believe appropriate U.S. trade strategies
are a promising avenue to dealing with unreasonable foreign government
action. Positive actions in the U.S. can also reduce prices in the
U.S., including removing misaligned incentives that cause PBMs to favor
more expensive products and lead to higher out-of-pocket costs for U.S.
patients, like the administration's proposal regarding the rebate safe
harbor. One potential proposal would be to create a special USTR
negotiator specifically for drug pricing issues.
foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
Question. President Trump and Secretary Azar have both repeatedly
described their frustrations with ``foreign freeloading'' of U.S. drugs
in the last year.
``When foreign governments extort unreasonably low prices from U.S.
drug makers, Americans have to pay more to subsidize the enormous cost
of research and development. . . . It's unfair and it's ridiculous, and
it's not going to happen any longer.''
Do you agree that because of foreign countries' pricing and
reimbursement systems, U.S. patients and innovators are shouldering the
burden for financing medical advances?
How do foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement systems affect
our prescription drug costs?
Are foreign governments taking note of the concerns being raised by
the Trump administration and have they responded in any way?
Has there been any noticeable change in any of our trade agreements
since these concerns have been raised by the Trump administration?
Answer. We agree that foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
systems result in their not paying enough to support the
biopharmaceutical innovation from which they benefit. This causes the
U.S. to shoulder more than its fair share of financing medical
advances. These pricing and reimbursement systems do not necessarily,
however, affect prescription drug costs in the U.S. in any direct or
algorithmic fashion. Rather, Merck approaches pricing from the
perspective of value. This approach looks at the value that a medicine
provides through multiple lenses with the goal of reflecting its
benefit to patients and to society, while at the same time paying an
appropriate return on invested capital to our investors, to ensure that
we are able to sustain R&D. While each individual situation varies
based on factual circumstances and market dynamics, generally, we
consider:

Value provided to patients--to what extent does a new
medicine or vaccine establish a new standard of care that has
the potential to significantly extend and improve patient
lives?

Value provided to health-care systems--to what extent does a
new medicine or vaccine reduce the costs associated with
hospitalization and other costly complications of disease if
not appropriately (or optimally) treated?

Unmet need--does a new medicine or vaccine address a
critically unmet medical need, where few or no treatments
exist?

Access--what is the ability of various customers around the
world--including national, regional or local institutional
payers, physicians, employers and patients--to pay for our
products?

R&D sustainability--given the long-term risk and cost of
capital, can we appropriately compensate our investors to
ensure continued investment in the kind of risky and capital-
intensive research and development that will bring forward
medically important breakthroughs?

Competition--what are the costs of other treatments
currently on the market relative to the value provided by
Merck's products?
Prices in other countries often reflect different value systems and
criteria. It is important to note that all components of the health
care system, including hospital services, physician services, physician
salaries, and medical devices are considerably less expensive in
foreign countries than in the U.S. That said, we agree that foreign
countries' pricing and reimbursement systems result in their not
sufficiently supporting biopharmaceutical innovation. While foreign
governments are generally aware of concerns raised by the Trump
administration, we are not aware of any substantive response.
There has been some change in trade agreements, but more work needs
to be done. U.S. free trade agreements address discriminatory
approaches to pricing and reimbursement and ensure fair treatment for
innovative medicines through commitments established by trade partners.
Free trade agreements can help advance innovation, versus approaches
proposed by the administration such as the International Pricing Index
that have the potential to stifle investment in R&D by driving down
prices across markets.
Here are three examples:

A 2004 U.S. Department of Commerce study examining OECD
countries found that foreign price controls restrict the
ability to innovate in our sector and identified trade
agreements as a key lever. We strongly encourage the Trump
administration to update this report to reflect the impact of
continued price controls in OECD countries.

The pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement provisions in
the U.S.-
Mexico-Canada Agreement commit governments to provide
transparency and due process protections in national
pharmaceutical reimbursement processes and decisions. This is a
step in the right direction, but more is needed to ensure that
many countries, such as Canada, appropriately recognize the
value of innovative medicines.

The Trump administration has worked to ensure adherence to
commitments in pricing and reimbursement in the Korea-U.S. Free
Trade Agreement, and direct advocacy by the U.S. has also made
an impact in Japan to mitigate some approaches.
There is clearly more work to be done in these areas, and trade
tools such as a new U.S.-Japan Free Trade Agreement, are critical.
medicaid closed formulary proposals
Question. In an attempt to bring down drug costs, various States
have been exploring whether to exclude certain drugs from its Medicaid
program. For example, the State of Massachusetts' recently asked CMS
for permission to create a closed formulary where the State Medicaid
program would pick at least one drug per therapeutic class. CMS denied
their waiver request citing violation of Federal law, but this proposal
does bring up important questions on how to contain drug prices in
State Medicaid programs.
If the principles of the Medicare Part D program--including the
necessary patient protections--were applied to State Medicaid programs,
do you think it lower drugs costs while ensuring access to patients?
Answer. There are important differences in the population covered
under Medicaid and the coverage options available that need to be
considered. Medicaid beneficiaries remain some of the sickest and most
complex populations of patients, with sometimes inconsistent
relationships with health-care providers and other complicating factors
that make accessing medical care already difficult. Many Medicaid
patients have complex diseases for which there are not always
therapeutically equivalent drugs available, so access to the specific
drug providers prescribe is crucial.
Part D is a highly competitive, successful program that has come in
at nearly half the cost that was originally projected. It also has
extremely high rates of beneficiary satisfaction--generally around 90
percent. While Part D offers multiple plan options and levels of
benefits such that patients can shop for plans that cover their
medicines at varying levels of cost-sharing, patients in Medicaid do
not have access to alternative coverage options. So, if a medicine they
need is not available, they do not have the ability to switch plans or
otherwise obtain access to the medicine.
As a result, the use of restrictive formularies is likely to result
in adverse effects on beneficiary outcomes and increased costs when
applied in Medicaid. While the patient protections that exist in Part D
may provide beneficiaries with an option to appeal formulary decisions,
it would be complicated to navigate for Medicaid patients and their
providers, who may have limited resources to take on the additional
responsibility and may take time that patients with complex conditions
may not have.
Medicaid is already receiving the best price based on the statutory
rebate and States have flexibility to exert utilization management
controls to negotiate supplemental rebates. Given this, we believe that
applying the principles of Medicare Part D in Medicaid is not likely to
result in lower drug costs without significantly impacting access.
medicaid ``best price''
Question. In the Trump administration's Blueprint, they suggested
that because drug manufactures have to give Medicaid the ``best price''
on drugs, there is no incentive to offer deeper discounts to other
payers--both government and commercial--than what is already offered
under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Does the Medicaid ``best price'' requirement encourage
manufacturers to increase initial prices?
What, if any, changes would you suggest we make to the program?
Answer. We can speak only to Merck's practices, and Merck does not
consider the Medicaid Best Price requirement when setting initial
prices. Merck approaches pricing from the perspective of value. This
approach looks at the value that a medicine provides through multiple
lenses with the goal of reflecting its benefit to patients and to
society, while at the same time paying an appropriate return on
invested capital to our investors, to ensure that we are able to
sustain R&D. While each individual situation varies based on factual
circumstances and market dynamics, generally, we consider:

Value provided to patients--to what extent does a new
medicine or vaccine establish a new standard of care that has
the potential to significantly extend and improve patient
lives?

Value provided to health-care systems--to what extent does a
new medicine or vaccine reduce the costs associated with
hospitalization and other costly complications of disease if
not appropriately (or optimally) treated?

Unmet need--does a new medicine or vaccine address a
critically unmet medical need, where few or no treatments
exist?

Access--what is the ability of various customers around the
world--including national, regional or local institutional
payers, physicians, employers and patients--to pay for our
products?

R&D sustainability--given the long-term risk and cost of
capital, can we appropriately compensate our investors to
ensure continued investment in the kind of risky and capital-
intensive research and development that will bring forward
medically-important breakthroughs?

Competition--what are the costs of other treatments
currently on the market relative to the value provided by
Merck's products?
We recognize the value that the Medicaid program provides for
patients who need it, and we do not believe the ``best price''
requirement encourages manufacturers to increase initial prices.
Merck believes that the exclusion of value-based arrangements
(VBAs) from the calculations of Best Price, Average Manufacturer Price,
and Average Sales Price would facilitate VBA implementation, which
would further align prices with the value that pharmaceutical products
bring to the market.
outcomes-based contracts
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you highlight your
support of outcomes-based contracts and how we need to be shifting our
system toward that approach.
How will these contracts lower drug costs for patients in both the
near term and long-term?
How will they lower overall health-care costs for our Federal
programs?
What have the preliminary results looked like so far?
Answer. For more than 10 years, Merck has worked with payers and
health-care providers to advance alternative pricing and contracting
arrangements and Merck has publicly shared information about value-
based agreements (VBAs) it entered into with the payers Aetna and
Cigna. We are continuously reviewing ways in which the company may
enter into VBAs for our products, which we define as a contractual
framework aimed at achieving a mutually agreed upon value objective
that that drives greater value from health-care spending. Merck is
interested, where business and customer objectives align, to implement
VBAs across the health-care market, including Medicare Part D, Managed
Medicaid, and Fee-For-Service Medicaid.
By aligning payments for medicines more directly with their value
in improving meaningful health outcomes and/or reducing the need for
other health-care services (such as hospitalizations), VBAs make
pharmaceutical manufacturers accountable for the results their products
achieve in a concrete way and can help improve patients' health and
maximize the benefits of health-care spending. A recent Avalere survey
of payers found that 44 percent of payers engaged in outcomes-based
contracts experienced improvements in patient outcomes.\8\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ Avalere Health. ``Outcomes-Based Contracts: Payer
Perspectives.'' Avalere Policy 360. July 19, 2018.
VBAs also can increase patient access to new therapies which could
ultimately improve patient outcomes. A payer that might otherwise
decline to cover a new medicine (or that would only cover the medicine
with significant utilization management restrictions or high cost
sharing) due to uncertainties about the expected percentage of its
patient population who would benefit might increase access to the
medicine if the manufacturer shared the risks of the medicine's
performance. These agreements may make medicines more accessible to
patients who will benefit from them and increase competition in
relevant therapeutic classes.\9\ Researchers have found that value-
based arrangements can improve patient access to medicines.\10\

contracts in: Seely, E., and Kesselheim, A. ``Outcomes-Based
Pharmaceutical Contracts: An Answer to High U.S. Drug Spending?''
Commonwealth Fund. Issue Brief. September 2017.
While Merck has had some experience with VBAs, these efforts have
not been as robust as they could be due to the challenges involved in
developing and implementing them. In addition to infrastructure and
data limitations, challenges include regulatory limitations such as
government pricing frameworks (e.g., Medicaid Best Price (BP) rules,
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Medicare's Average Sales Price (ASP)) and Federal fraud and abuse laws.
Accordingly, we support opportunities that would enable greater
experimentation in the design, structure, and implementation of VBAs.
Further innovation in this space is needed to support overall sponsor
and plan learning, and to determine the range of potential benefits to
diverse health systems and beneficiaries. To fully achieve these goals,
however, the impacts of the current regulatory framework, including
government pricing requirements, the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
(AKS), and overall environmental barriers, must be analyzed and
addressed as appropriate. Policy solutions such as the Patient
Affordability Value and Efficiency Act (PAVE), introduced by Senators
Warner and Cassidy, could provide necessary regulatory flexibility for
properly structured VBAs.
transparency/point of sale
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you express your
support for the Trump administration's proposal to allow manufacturers
to provide PBMs up-front discounts that are passed onto patients at the
point-of-sale.
Do you feel like this proposal will make the transactions within
the drug supply chain more transparent?
If so, would this transparency bring down drug costs--overall and
for specialty drugs?
Answer. We believe we must change the system to ensure that
patients receive the benefit of the significant rebates and discounts
that manufacturers like Merck pay to PBMs and plans. The proposed rule
is a positive step in that direction. Based on our initial assessment
of the proposal, we believe that it will remove misaligned incentives
within the system, drive more transparency in the system, and most
importantly, lower beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs.
the relationship between wholesalers and manufacturers
Question. When talking about the pharmaceutical supply chain, a lot
of focus has been placed on the Pharmacy Benefit Manager. But there's
another side of the equation that I'd like to ask about.
How do wholesalers negotiate pricing with manufacturers?
What impact does this have on drug costs?
What incentives or disincentives do they have to contain price
increases?
Answer. There are many entities supporting the distribution and
dispensing of pharmaceutical products. Wholesalers purchase
pharmaceutical products directly from manufacturers and subsequently
sell those products to sites of care for dispensing. Downstream
customers of the wholesalers include retail and specialty pharmacies,
hospitals, clinics, and others. Those entities that purchase from the
wholesalers ultimately dispense or administer the drug to patients.
Many manufacturers typically offer a ``prompt pay'' discount to
wholesalers in exchange for timely payment of invoices (2 percent for
payment within 30 or 35 days is fairly standard in the industry).
Manufacturers also contract with wholesalers for services that
support the appropriate storage and distribution of product to
appropriate customers within the supply chain. These ``Distribution
Service Agreements'' provide wholesalers with an opportunity to earn
fees based on performance against pre-defined metrics that are part of
a set of standard services. These services include managing inventory
levels, achieving defined service levels, consolidating receipt of
inventory to a central location, and administering contract pricing and
chargebacks. Although these distribution service fees manufacturers pay
to wholesalers are commonly administered as a percent of the list
price, they are negotiated at arm's length and are based on fair market
value for the services rendered.
The terms of wholesaler agreements with their downstream customers
vary; however, in general, the prices they offer to their customers are
set relative to a product's list prices. In general, fees paid to
wholesalers by manufacturers are modest and wholesaler economics
(including both buy and sell side) are not likely to influence the
setting of a product's list price.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
proposed rebate rule
Question. As has been done in many other settings, drug
manufacturers said during the hearing that one reason list prices for
drugs are high is that pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) demand
larger and larger rebates in order for the drug to receive favorable
placement on a formulary. You and your colleagues who testified during
the hearing stated if the administration's proposal on changes to the
anti-kickback safe harbor for pharmaceutical rebates took effect, your
company would likely lower list price.
Like many Oregonians, I am skeptical drug manufacturers would
voluntarily lower their prices. Therefore, would you support
legislation that would (1) make similar changes the administration has
put forward related to Part D and Medicaid managed care, (2) change the
rebate system in a similar way to the proposal for the commercial
market, and (3) require drug makers to lower the list price of their
drugs equal to the amount of rebates provided today?
Answer. We believe we must change the system to ensure that
patients receive the benefit of the significant rebates and discounts
that manufacturers like Merck pay to PBMs and plans. The proposed rule
is a positive step in that direction. Based on our initial assessment
of the proposed rule, we believe that it will remove misaligned
incentives within the system, drive more transparency in the system,
and most importantly, lower beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs. Merck
supports the earliest possible implementation of the proposed rule that
can be achieved without creating disruption for the beneficiaries who
rely on Medicare for their drug coverage. We are committed to working
with the PBMs and health plans and other intermediaries to make this
happen.
We do not support legislation to require manufacturers to lower
their list price equal to the amount of rebates today. First, different
purchasers receive different levels of discounts, based on
individualized negotiations and the formulary positioning of Merck's
products. So, there is not a uniform ``rebate amount'' that could
reduce the list price. Moreover, we expect that the robust negotiations
that occur today will continue in the highly competitive Part D market,
and we expect to realize the same level of net price that we do today.
In fact, we expect that there could be additional pricing pressure
under the new system, which could lead to lower net prices.
Over time, we expect that our list prices will go down if the
misaligned incentives across the system are addressed. We are currently
working with other stakeholders in the system to solve the operational
challenges that will enable these changes.
But, it is also important to note that if the rule is implemented,
Medicare beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs will be reduced,
independent of any lowering of list prices, since their cost-sharing
will be based on the net price. Nonetheless, we believe the rebate rule
will align incentives in a way that will restrain list prices.
As we stated when we reduced the list price of several of our
products in July 2018, we have continued to look for opportunities to
reduce our list prices. We think the proposed rule would help create
those opportunities, but it can't happen overnight. All the players in
the ecosystem will need to adjust to the new model. We are actively
working to support the move to a contracting model in Part D that would
change the incentives to support lower list prices.
Lowering list prices is not an easy thing to do in our health-care
system:

One of the key challenges to lowering list prices is the
contractual arrangements that companies have with PBMs and
health plans, which are intended to ensure access to our
products. These contracts are often multi-year and are most
often written to provide a discount off of the list price,
which is paid as a rebate later.

To reduce the list price without significant financial
consequences, all of these contracts would need to be modified
to maintain the same net price. Unless the entire system
changes, one manufacturer runs the risk of being disadvantaged
and losing formulary status or being required to pay the same
percentage discount on a lower list, which could be
unsustainable.

In addition, drugs flow through a complex supply chain, from
the manufacturer, to the wholesaler, to a pharmacy or hospital
who dispenses the drug to patients. For any product but even
more so for a high volume primary care product that is flowing
through to all pharmacies and hospitals, there is not a
mechanism in place to readjust the value of the inventory being
held by all those parties.
If the proposed rule is implemented as written, it would only apply
to our contracts with PBMs and health plans for Medicare Part D and
Managed Medicaid. If PBMs and health plans maintain the rebate model in
the commercial market, we would still have commercial contracts based
on rebates, which would be subject to the existing constraints to
lowering list price. We also would still need a mechanism to revalue
drug in the distribution channel in a financially viable manner.
medicaid drug rebate program
Question. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) requires
manufacturers to provide a basic rebate and an additional inflationary
rebate for both brand and generic drugs. The inflationary rebate is an
increasingly substantial part of total rebates due in large part to
large increases in drug prices that exceed inflation. Under current
law, this inflationary rebate is capped at 100 percent of Average
Manufacturer Price (AMP). This is the case even when manufacturers
continue to raise their prices well above inflation.
Please provide a list of all of your pharmaceutical products that
have reached the Medicaid AMP rebate cap in any of the 20 quarters from
January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018.
For each drug listed in response to question 1, please also provide
a list of which quarters and years each drug hit the cap.
Answer. Merck conforms to all statutory, regulatory, and sub-
regulatory guidance regarding its participation in the Medicaid Drug
Rebate Program, including the payment of Medicaid rebates. The
information requested by this question, however, is confidential,
proprietary, and commercially and competitively sensitive. Merck would
be happy to explore other means to share this information with the
committee in a confidential fashion.
medicaid drug rebate program compliance
Question. I am concerned about recent reports and legal settlements
surrounding drug manufacturers' failure to comply fully with the
requirements of the MDRP. For example, an analysis by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General
found that between 2012 and 2016 taxpayers may have overpaid by as much
as $1.3 billion for 10 potentially misclassified drugs. That is why I
introduced the Right Rebate Act with Chairman Grassley to prevent drug
manufacturers from manipulating Medicaid to increase their profits.
However, I continued to be concerned about oversight and manufacturer
compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Accordingly, please describe the following:
Your company's current compliance plan and procedures used to
ensure compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program including internal audits or other checks you use to identify
compliance vulnerabilities.
Answer. Merck's government price reporting team--in consultation
with in-house attorneys, outside counsel, and third-party vendors as
appropriate--maintains comprehensive and detailed government price
reporting policies, procedures, and reasonable assumptions for
compliance with all price reporting programs, including the Medicaid
Drug Rebate Program (MDRP). Merck's policies are evaluated and updated,
as needed, on an annual basis by the government price report team, in-
house attorneys, and outside counsel to ensure that they are consistent
with current regulations and applicable guidance from the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). Additionally, Merck's reasonable
assumptions are evaluated and updated, as needed, on a monthly basis
for Average Manufacturer Price and on a quarterly basis for Best Price
by the government price reporting team, in-house attorneys, and outside
counsel. Merck has a long history of transparency and communication
with CMS regarding its MDRP compliance and reasonable assumptions, and
company compliance personnel regularly oversee Merck's price reporting
operations. Merck evaluates any new guidance issued by CMS to ensure
that its price reporting calculations and processes are in compliance
with the law.
Question. Any past or ongoing issues of non-compliance.
Answer. Merck maintains comprehensive and detailed reasonable
assumptions for its MDRP participation. In situations in which Merck is
uncertain about a calculation approach that is not clearly addressed in
CMS rules or guidance, the company documents its approach in
assumptions and/or discloses its intended approach to CMS.
Additionally, given the complexity of the calculations, Merck may
identify calculation mistakes or other issues that require correction.
This may happen, for example, to the extent that Merck believes that
any new CMS rules or guidance call into question a reasonable
assumption that the company has previously maintained. In such cases,
if Merck has any concern about its program compliance, it promptly
communicates with CMS to seek the agency's guidance and potentially
restate its prior MDRP reports.
Question. Any corrective actions taken to address identified
problems or issues of non-compliance with the MDRP and how such steps
were communicated to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Answer. As noted above, to the extent that Merck believes that any
of its existing calculation or compliance processes for MDRP
participation are not in keeping with current CMS rules or guidance,
the Company would promptly engage with the agency to identify any
necessary remedial steps and the appropriate way forward, including
filing pricing restatements.
Question. Any steps taken to improve compliance and ensure that all
Medicaid drug rebates owed to the Federal Government and the States are
paid in full.
Answer. As noted above, Merck takes its government price reporting
obligations very seriously, and the Company maintains robust, ongoing
legal and compliance oversight of its price reporting team and its
operations. As discussed above, we routinely review our policies,
procedures, and reasonable assumptions to ensure compliance with
current law. Merck also has an annual training requirement for
government price reporting compliance. If Merck were to identify any
potential noncompliance issue associated with the underpayment of
rebates to the State Medicaid Programs, Merck immediately would
identify this issue to CMS and would work with the agency to ensure the
implementation of any appropriate remedy (including restating pricing
metrics and reconciling rebate amounts with the States).
bonus payments tied to specific drugs
Question. I am concerned by the potential for employee financial
incentives to encourage high launch prices and price increases for
prescription drugs.
Is your salary, bonus, or other compensation tied to sales or
revenue targets of a single product your company sells? Has it ever
been? If yes, please state the product or products to which your
salary, bonus, or other compensation was tied.
Answer. My salary, bonus, or other compensation is not tied to
sales or revenue targets of a single product that Merck sells. In 2011,
a very small percentage of my annual bonus was tied to the net sales of
3 new products (DULERA, SIMPONI, and VICTRELIS).
Question. Is your salary, bonus, or other compensation tied to
either revenue or net income of the company as a whole? Has it ever
been? If yes, please explain what assumptions about price increases are
used when the compensation committee sets revenue or net income goals.
Does the compensation committee provide any guidance to executives in
regards to the amount of revenue that the company will generate from
price increases versus volume growth?
Answer. Yes, a portion of my annual bonus is tied to revenue and
pretax income (i.e., a variation of net income) of the company as a
whole, with each contributing 40 percent (for a total of 80 percent) to
the aggregate incentive target, and research and development
productivity constituting the other 20 percent of the target. The final
bonus that I receive is then calculated based on the company's actual
performance for those three metrics.
The Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Board sets annual
targets for revenue and pretax income based upon the company's annual
plan, as approved by the full Board of Directors.
The company's annual plan includes U.S. pricing assumptions
informed by several variables, including volume, price, and discount
rates, which for 2019 are fully consistent with our July 19, 2018
commitment to not increase net price across our product portfolio in
the U.S. by more than inflation annually.
Neither the board of directors as a whole, nor the Compensation and
Benefits Committee specifically, provides guidance to executives with
regard to the amount of revenue that the company will generate from
price increases versus volume growth.
net prices
Question. In your testimony, you stated, ``last year we pledged
that we will not increase our average net prices for our portfolio by
more than the rate of inflation annually,'' and that ``From 2010 to
2017, Merck's average net price increase across our portfolio each year
has been in the low to mid-single digits. In fact, our average net
price declined in 2017 by almost 2 percent. In 2017, the average
discount for our medicines and vaccines was more than 45 percent lower
than the list price.'' Please describe how the company's year-over-year
aggregate net price is calculated. Please also specifically address the
following questions:
Answer. Net Price Change represents the year-over-year change in
average net price, which is Wholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC) less
rebates, discounts, and returns. The annual percent change versus prior
year was calculated at a product level and weighted across the
company's U.S. Product Portfolio. U.S. Product Portfolio includes human
health pharmaceutical and vaccine products marketed by the company,
excluding partnered products. The product sales utilized in the
analysis represent 97 percent of the total U.S. Product Portfolio in
2010, increasing each year to approach 99.8 percent of coverage in
2017.
Question. How many products are included in the calculation of the
average net price change? What was the median net price change?
Answer. In 2017, 78 products were included. The median net price
change was 0 percent.
Question. Is net price weighted? If so, how? For example, in
determining the aggregate net price does the company assign different
weights to different products based on volume or other factors? Are
``on patent'' and ``off patent'' drugs weighted identically? Are other
statistical weights used or are all products treated equally?
Answer. The Net Price Change percent for each product is weighted
by its Net Sales relative to the Total Net Sales of the Product
Portfolio for the current year. On and off patent drugs are calculated
in the same fashion, and no other ``statistical weighting'' is applied.
Question. Does the figure that you provided during your testimony
account for U.S. prices, international prices, or both? Generally
speaking, when your company reports net price changes, does it
differentiate between U.S. and international prices?
Answer. Only U.S. prices are used in the report.
Question. Please list the five drugs your company sold in the U.S.
that had the greatest year-over-year net price increase in 2018, noting
the increase for each drug by dollar figure and percentage. Please list
the five drugs your company sold in the U.S. that had the lowest year-
over-year net price increase (and/or the greatest decrease) in 2018,
noting the increase (or decrease) for each drug by dollar figure and
percentage.
Answer. The product-specific information requested is competitively
sensitive and Merck therefore cannot produce it in a public setting in
which it could be accessed by competitors. However, Merck does report
similar information in an aggregated format in its annual price
transparency report, which we proactively make available on our
corporate responsibility website:

The report sets forth the average annual list price changes across
the Merck portfolio as well as other price related information
concerning Merck medicines and vaccines. The report shows that in 2018
the average annual list price across the Merck portfolio increased by
5.5 percent--the lowest increase since 2010--as compared with a 6.6
percent increase in 2017. In 2018, the Company's gross U.S. sales were
reduced by 44.3% as a result of rebates, discounts and returns. The

Question. In Merck's most recent pricing transparency report, the
company notes that the ``the average annual net price across our
portfolio declined by 1.9 percent, reflecting specific in-year
dynamics, including the impact of loss of patent protection for three
major medicines.'' Please identify these medicines, and the net price
change for each of them on a dollar and percentage basis for 2017. What
was Merck's average net price increase/decrease in 2017 for drugs
excluding these three medications?
Answer. This information is confidential, proprietary, and
commercially sensitive. Merck's average net price increase/decrease in
2017 excluding the three drugs referred to is -0.6 percent.
Question. In Merck's pricing transparency report, the company
states that its net price is ``represents the year-over-year change in
average net price, which is WAC less rebates, discounts and returns,''
while its average discount is ``weighted . . . [and] calculated by
dividing annual rebates, discounts and returns by annual gross sales.''
Please clarify whether the company's average net price is weighted for
purposes of complying with its publically stated pledge.
Answer. Yes, the average net price is weighted.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez
Question. When new products enter the market, do drug companies set
high initial rebates and then provide deep rebates in order to gain
access to insurance plan's formularies?
Answer. Merck approaches pricing from the perspective of value.
This approach looks at the value that a medicine provides through
multiple lenses with the goal of reflecting its benefit to patients and
to society, while at the same time paying an appropriate return on
invested capital to our investors, to ensure that we are able to
sustain R&D. While each individual situation varies based on factual
circumstances and market dynamics, generally, we consider:

Value provided to patients--to what extent does a new
medicine or vaccine establish a new standard of care that has
the potential to significantly extend and improve patient
lives?

Value provided to health-care systems--to what extent does a
new medicine or vaccine reduce the costs associated with
hospitalization and other costly complications of disease if
not appropriately (or optimally) treated?

Unmet need--does a new medicine or vaccine address a
critically unmet medical need, where few or no treatments
exist?

Access--what is the ability of various customers around the
world--including national, regional or local institutional
payers, physicians, employers and patients--to pay for our
products?

R&D sustainability--given the long-term risk and cost of
capital, can we appropriately compensate our investors to
ensure continued investment in the kind of risky and capital-
intensive research and development that will bring forward
medically important breakthroughs?

Competition--what are the costs of other treatments
currently on the market relative to the value provided by
Merck's products?
When the company launched ZEPATIER into the Hepatitis C market,
Merck chose a low list price strategy, while competitors had a higher
price with significant rebates. Unfortunately, we were unable to gain
reasonable formulary status or resulting sales in certain market
segments with this strategy. Positive actions in the U.S., such as the
administration's proposal regarding the rebate safe harbor could
provide incentives for lower initial list prices in the future.
Question. If CMS finalizes the rebate rule, do you anticipate
future products entering the market with significantly lower initial
list prices?
Answer. Over time, we expect that list prices will go down if you
remove the misaligned incentives in the system. It is also important to
note that if the rule is implemented, Medicare beneficiaries' out-of-
pocket costs will be reduced--independent of any lowering of list
prices--since their cost-sharing will be based on the net price. But we
believe the rebate rule will align incentives in a way that will
restrain list prices.
If this rule is implemented as written, it would only apply to our
contracts with PBMs and health plans for Medicare Part D and Managed
Medicaid. If PBMs and health plans maintain the rebate model in the
commercial market, we would still have commercial contracts based on
rebates, which would be subject to the existing constraints to lowering
list price. We also would still need a mechanism to revalue drug in the
distribution channel in a financially viable manner.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Thomas R. Carper
Question. What are your recommendations for lowering prices for the
40 percent of drugs that do not offer rebates in Medicare Part D?
Answer. Assuming the 40 percent reference is correct, we believe
that the administration's rebate safe harbor proposal will lead to
lower prices even for products which currently may offer no or minimal
rebates in Medicare Part D. We believe the increasing transparency of
prices will spur heightened competition even in classes and for
products where rebating has been limited in the current system.
Similarly, the fact that price concessions will be made directly
available to patients will also create a price-reducing dynamic since
price concessions will make products more affordable to patients,
resulting potentially in greater adherence and appropriate use of
prescribed medicines, clearly benefiting patients and encouraging
manufacturers to offer price concessions. Additionally, assuming policy
changes are made to further incentivize value-based contracts, we
believe that value-based contracts can also help to restrain initial
list prices by tying those prices to the value that the products bring
to patients and the health-care system.
Question. In the health insurance plans that you offer your
employees, do you ask your insurers to pass through the full
manufacturer rebates to the beneficiaries?
Answer. Merck offers a generous health-care benefit for our 24,000
U.S. employees. There is no deductible for medications covered under
our pharmacy benefit, and employees never have to pay more than $50 for
a retail prescription for a covered medication, and in most cases pay
less. We contract with a PBM for management of the prescription drug
benefits for our employees, and the benefit does not offer point-of-
sale rebates to our employees. Merck uses savings generated by rebates
to lower overall costs for employees while ensuring low out-of-pocket
costs.
Question. The systems for pricing and distributing drugs are opaque
and difficult to understand. What are your recommendations for
increasing transparency in how your companies set the list prices for
drugs, and for improving transparency in the supply chain for
prescription drugs? Would you support Federal standards for
transparency in setting the list prices for drugs?
Answer. We are open and transparent about the factors we consider
in setting prices. Merck approaches pricing from the perspective of
value. This approach looks at the value that a medicine provides
through multiple lenses with the goal of reflecting its benefit to
patients and to society, while at the same time paying an appropriate
return on invested capital to our investors, to ensure that we are able
to sustain R&D. While each individual situation varies based on factual
circumstances and market dynamics, generally, we consider:

Value provided to patients--to what extent does a new
medicine or vaccine establish a new standard of care that has
the potential to significantly extend and improve patient
lives?

Value provided to health-care systems--to what extent does a
new medicine or vaccine reduce the costs associated with
hospitalization and other costly complications of disease if
not appropriately (or optimally) treated?

Unmet need--does a new medicine or vaccine address a
critically unmet medical need, where few or no treatments
exist?

Access--what is the ability of various customers around the
world--including national, regional or local institutional
payers, physicians, employers and patients--to pay for our
products?

R&D sustainability--given the long-term risk and cost of
capital, can we appropriately compensate our investors to
ensure continued investment in the kind of risky and capital-
intensive research and development that will bring forward
medically important breakthroughs?

Competition--what are the costs of other treatments
currently on the market relative to the value provided by
Merck's products?
Question. In nearly every sector of the health-care industry,
Medicare, Medicaid, employers, and insurers are moving away from fee-
for-service payments to reimbursements based on value and performance.
Prescription drugs and medical devices were the glaring exceptions to
this trend until recently. How many of your drugs are included in
value-based contracts and how many patients are benefiting from them?
How do these value-based contracts work to lower drug prices for both
patients and taxpayers?
Answer. Merck has been party to value-based discounting
arrangements for four of its products. It is difficult to assess
exactly how many patients have benefitted from them, however, since
that information is not in Merck's possession under the arrangements.
Merck agrees that value-based discounting strategies can benefit
patients and the Federal health care programs by ensuring that payment
aligns with the value or outcomes that a manufacturer's products bring
to the system. If, for example, a value-based agreement demonstrates
that a manufacturer's product helps patients to achieve meaningful
clinical outcomes (or even to avoid more serious illness complications
or comorbidities), the product would have demonstrated a savings to
patients and taxpayers (for example, by avoiding hospitalization or
further treatment for a particular condition). There are, however,
significant impediments under current law regarding adopting this type
of contract--including under the Anti-Kickback Statute and manufacturer
government price reporting obligations--and Merck supports legislative
or regulatory reforms to increase the proliferation of value- or
outcomes-based discounting.
Question. Last year, Senator Portman and I did an investigation on
the pricing of an opioid overdose reversal drug called EVZIO,
manufactured by Kaleo. Kaleo increased the price of EVZIO from $575 in
2014 to $4,100 in 2017. We found that the best price Medicare was able
to get for EVZIO, about $4,000, was much higher than the price other
Federal programs and private insurers were able to get. It seemed that
Kaleo was able to get this higher price of $4,000 from Medicare by
helping doctors fill out paperwork showing that the drug was medically
necessary, even though there are cheaper alternatives on the market. As
a result of the investigation, Kaleo announced it will bring a generic
version of the drug to market at only $168 per pack. Are any of your
companies providing medical necessity paperwork to doctors in order to
get your drugs covered by Medicare?
Answer. In the United States, Merck provides limited reimbursement
support for patients in connection with the purchase of certain of
Merck's products following a physician's prescribing decision (in
accordance with Department of Health and Human Services Office of
Inspector General guidance). In certain cases, this support includes
identifying--for patients and physicians--the appropriate forms and
insurance processes attendant to securing insurance coverage for our
products. But it is Merck's policy never to interfere with the
physician-patient relationship or the decision about whether to seek
insurance coverage.
Question. In 2017, the Rand Corporation estimated that biosimilar
drugs, which are competitors to complex, biologic drugs, could save the
United States more than $50 billion over the next decade. Some of you
have also argued that increasing the use of biosimilar drugs would help
lower drugs costs for consumers and taxpayers. What is delaying the
uptake of biosimilar drugs in the United States? What policies do you
recommend to increase the development of biosimilar drugs?
Answer. Merck agrees that we can significantly reduce spending on
pharmaceuticals, especially for patients, by ensuring that we have a
viable market for biosimilars in the United States. We believe, like
with traditional small molecule medicines, generic competition after a
reasonable period of exclusivity will create headroom for patients to
afford the newest, most innovative medicines. In addition to the RAND
data that you referenced, other research shows that generics and
biosimilars are expected to drive savings of $105 billion through 2022
in the U.S.\11\

We suggest the following policy changes to help encourage and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
support prescriber biosimilar utilization:

Consider options to reduce or eliminate patient cost sharing
in Medicare Part B for biosimilars. While some Part B
beneficiaries are already able to reduce their 20 percent cost
sharing via supplemental coverage, we believe eliminating cost
sharing will encourage many physicians to use biosimilars for
their patients. A similar approach in Part D and in Medicaid
for small-molecule generics has driven generic utilization up
to 90 percent.\12\

General. ``Generic Drug Utilization in the Medicare Part D Program.''
(Nov. 2007), https://oig.hhs.gov/oei/reports/oei-05-07-00130.pdf.

Create pathways for MA and Part D plans to receive bonus
payments and/or enhanced star ratings for achieving metrics
related to access to biosimilars. This will incentivize plans
to implement policies that drive additional utilization of
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
biosimilars.

Consider alternative reimbursement methodologies that adjust
the current Part B reimbursement formula. The current structure
in Part B to reimburse at ASP + 6 percent of the reference
product ASP ensures there is no reimbursement downside to
physicians for using biosimilars. But so far, the evidence does
not suggest the current reimbursement rate sufficiently
incentivizes providers to use biosimilar products. The
administration should consider alternatives to further
incentivize physician adoption of biosimilars.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
Question. The United States is one of the only countries in the
world to allow prescription drug manufacturers to advertise directly to
consumers through magazines, billboards, radio, and television
commercials. While I will not argue that it is beneficial to educate
consumers about an unfamiliar disease and encourage them to seek
medical help, most commercials from all of your companies recommend
asking about a specific brand name drug, not a medical condition.
Furthermore, even if your advertisements follow all FDA rules and list
medication side effects, they also almost always list these while a
smiling, apparently healthy person is walking on a beach.
Researchers say that this type of imagery, combined with viewing
hours of drug commercials each month, leads consumers to underestimate
the risks associated with medications. For the past decade, studies
have shown that aggressive direct-to-consumer advertising is associated
with rising drug prices and an increase in inappropriate drug
prescriptions.
Since researchers have concluded that consumers are
misunderstanding the benefits and risks described in your ads, what
further policies could help you and your colleagues ensure that you are
educating patients in a clear manner?
Answer. Merck believes that direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising
can be an important and helpful way to inform patients about diseases
that may be relevant to them and therapeutic options they may want to
discuss with their physician. Data demonstrate that DTC can have a
positive impact on patient health in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and
adherence to prescribed therapies. We recognize that DTC is one channel
amongst many to help educate patients. Print materials, telephone,
websites, and other channels are also used to provide more in-depth
information to patients. The ultimate decision to prescribe a product
for any specific patient remains with the physician following
discussion with their patient.
Merck adheres to FDA regulations and guidelines governing DTC
promotion and has a long-standing policy to voluntarily submit new DTC
broadcast advertising campaigns to FDA for pre-review. Merck also
follows the PhRMA Guiding Principles for DTC Advertisements About
Prescription Medicines. We are currently considering what additional
information we can make available to consumers to ensure that they can
make informed health care decisions.
pharmaceutical companies continue to raise prices
Question. As you are well aware, high prescription drug prices are
the number one concern for Americans and their families. According to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average
American spends around $1,208 annually on prescription drugs. There
have been several instances where brand name or even generic drugs that
have been on the market for years continue to increase in price.
One of the most well-known examples is Mylan's increase of the
price of EpiPen from less than $100 in 2007 to more than $600 in 2016.
Another example is the ever-increasing price of insulin. Sanofi
increased the price of a vial of Lantus from $88.20 in 2007 to $307.20
in 2017. And those are just a small sample of price increases.
Why don't we see price decreases for drugs that have been on the
market for years without new formulations or added benefit?
Answer. List prices do not generally decline largely owing to many
of the misaligned incentives that the administration's rebate safe
harbor proposal is designed to address. Specifically, rebate contracts
for commercial and Medicare Part D payers/PBMs are designed as set
percentages from the list price. Lowering list prices while maintaining
these same percentage discounts/rebates usually precludes the
commercial viability of reducing list prices.
We do in fact see price decreases for products that have been on
the market for years--extremely large ones. They occur at the time of
patent expiry, and often reduce prices by over 90 percent. This is
unlike any other part of the health care system we are aware of, where
prices drop massively after a specified period. If these massive one-
time price reductions occurred more gradually, it would be far more
obvious that prices were decreasing. Even putting this aside, net
prices on many products drop dramatically over time as competition from
new products increases. For instance, the average net price of our
anti-diabetes medicine Januvia is less today than it was when it was
launched in 2007.
pay for delay
Question. Pay for delay is a tactic that more and more branded drug
manufacturers have been using to stifle competition from lower-cost
generic manufacturers. This allows you to sidestep competition by
offering patent settlements that pay generic companies not to bring
lower-cost alternatives to market.
These ``pay-for-delay'' patent settlements benefit both brand-name
pharmaceutical companies by helping them avoid costly patent litigation
and general manufacturers by rewarding them a hefty sum to delay
entering the market with a cheaper drug alternative. However, these
deals do not benefit consumers. According to an FTC study, these
anticompetitive deals cost consumers and taxpayers $3.5 billion in
higher drug costs every year.
Does your company partake in pay-for-delay settlements?
Answer. Merck has not entered into patent settlement agreements
with generic companies to delay their entry past when it would
otherwise be lawful for them to enter the market. Merck has been party
to a number of patent settlement agreements that provide for generic
market entry prior to patent expiry, including some that have provided
some level of exclusivity for a limited time. These agreements allowed
generic products to enter the market earlier than would have otherwise
been the case. The FTC has not challenged as anti-competitive any of
these types of agreements involving Merck.
Question. Why would a pharmaceutical company enter into a pay-for-
delay agreement?
Answer. Parties enter into settlements of patent litigation for all
the same reasons parties settle other civil litigation. These include
allocation of risk in the dispute, avoidance of litigation costs, or
beneficial access to technology from cross-licensing of the litigant's
patents. Merck would be speculating as to why litigants would enter
into settlements with large unjustified reverse payments.
Question. Do you think these agreements stifle competition and
prevent generic alternatives to your branded medications?
Answer. Merck believes that the patent settlements it has made did
not stifle competition nor unlawfully prevent generic alternatives to
our patented medications.
Patent settlement agreements in which a brand settles cases in a
manner that allows a generic to enter the market prior to expiry of the
brand's patents could actually accelerate patient access to lower cost
alternatives. These settlements do not delay entry or cause the loss of
any lawful competition because entry prior to the expiry of these
patents would be unlawful infringement unless and until the generic
manufacturers prevailed in court.
Merck works within the statutory framework set by Hatch-Waxman and
BPCIA to protect its intellectual property. We believe that patent
holders have a valid right to enforce legitimate patents and that the
courts are an appropriate venue to resolve such disputes.
Our patents are a direct result of the investment we have made in
R&D. When others seek to commercialize our innovations, Merck has
engaged in litigation to enforce our patents.
Merck is a strong supporter of bringing more generics to the
market. It is important to remember that generics all started as a
branded medication. A period of patent protection is provided for all
new medicines as an incentive to research-based biopharmaceutical
companies for the costly and risky research that is undertaken to
develop them. Following the loss of patent protection, the medicines
become low-cost generics that are available for many years, often
decades into the future.
Merck is proud that more than 40 million Americans annually benefit
from our science in the form of generic medicines. Several of our
discoveries--including cholesterol-lowering, heart disease,
osteoporosis, and asthma treatments--are now widely available to a
patient as generics, including some for about $20 per year, bringing
billions of dollars in savings to consumers and the health care system.
drug rebate rule
Question. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services'
(HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) promulgated a new regulation to
remove regulatory safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback
Statute (AKS) for rebates on prescription drugs rebates paid by
manufactures to PBMs under Medicare Part D and for Medicaid managed
care organizations (MCOs). The OIG proposal attempts to ban most
rebates by eliminating their regulatory protections.
The rule is predicted to increase net drug costs in its early
years. The CMS actuaries estimate it would cost $196 billion over 10
years. Despite this high price tag, the beneficiary benefits are
limited. The proposed rule notes that under the CMS Actuary's analysis,
the majority of beneficiaries would see an increase in their total out-
of-pocket payments and premium costs; reductions in total cost sharing
will exceed total premium increases.
I wanted to ask a question about the administration's rebate rule,
which I understand that many of the drug manufacturers, and your main
trade association, strongly support. According to an analysis of the
rule by the Office of Actuaries at CMS, drug manufacturers are likely
to initially retain 15 percent of the current rebates as higher net
drug prices.
Given that estimate, can you provide the committee with any
assurances that prices will not increase under this proposed rule?
Answer. Over time, we expect that list prices will go down if the
misaligned incentives across the system are addressed. It is also
important to note that if the rule is implemented, Medicare
beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs will be reduced, independent of any
lowering of list prices, since their cost-sharing will be based on the
net price. Nonetheless, we believe the rebate rule will align
incentives in a way that will restrain list prices.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
Question. According to an article recently published in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, medical marketers spent nearly $30
billion dollars in 2016, up from $17 billion in 1997. Direct-to-
Consumer (DTC) advertising had the biggest percentage increase: from
$2.1 billion, or 11.9% of all medical marketing, in 1997 to $9.6
billion, or 32% of total spending, in 2016.
Can you please provide what your ratio of spending on sales and
marketing to research and development is today?
Answer. In 2018, Merck incurred $9.8 billion in research and
development costs globally, the vast majority of which was conducted in
the U.S. Since 2010, Merck has invested nearly $70 billion in R&D to
create new medicines and vaccines that address the greatest health
challenges of our time--including antimicrobial resistance, Ebola, HIV,
and cancer--to save and improve lives around the world. In 2018, Merck
spent about $2.3 billion in the U.S. market on direct marketing and
selling expenses. This number includes all sales and marketing
expenses, including creative development of resources and headcount
related to all marketing and sales activity in the U.S. market.
price-gouging
Question. Sanofi, as I understand it, has made a pledge to the
public to limit its price increases to the national health expenditures
growth projection.
Would your company commit to a cap on annual price increases as
part of your PhRMA membership criteria?
Answer. In July 2018, Merck pledged to not increase the average net
price across our portfolio by more than inflation annually.
Question. What policies would you propose to help ensure lower
launch prices for new drugs?
Answer. Merck approaches pricing from the perspective of value.
This approach looks at the value that a medicine provides through
multiple lenses with the goal of reflecting its benefit to patients and
to society, while at the same time paying an appropriate return on
invested capital to our investors, to ensure that we are able to
sustain R&D. While each individual situation varies based on factual
circumstances and market dynamics, generally, we consider:

Value provided to patients--to what extent does a new
medicine or vaccine establish a new standard of care that has
the potential to significantly extend and improve patient
lives?

Value provided to health-care systems--to what extent does a
new medicine or vaccine reduce the costs associated with
hospitalization and other costly complications of disease if
not appropriately (or optimally) treated?

Unmet need--does a new medicine or vaccine address a
critically unmet medical need, where few or no treatments
exist?

Access--what is the ability of various customers around the
world--including national, regional or local institutional
payers, physicians, employers and patients--to pay for our
products?

R&D sustainability--given the long-term risk and cost of
capital, can we appropriately compensate our investors to
ensure continued investment in the kind of risky and capital-
intensive research and development that will bring forward
medically important breakthroughs?

Competition--what are the costs of other treatments
currently on the market relative to the value provided by
Merck's products?
We believe the proper objective should be that launch prices
appropriately reflect the true value of the medicine and are not
distorted by any misaligned incentives in Medicare Part D or any other
sector. We believe the administration's proposed rebate safe harbor,
and similar changes in commercial plans, would address the misaligned
incentives in the marketplace that favor high list prices and high
rebates in competitive markets. In addition, addressing the misaligned
incentives for the 340B program would allow for more flexibility in
list prices.
transparency
Question. In many of your testimonies, you mentioned that the
current system of pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) back-end rebates do
not rarely results in a scenario where the PBM passes on savings to
consumers at the point of sale (POS). The administration recently
proposed a rule to eliminate the anti-kickback statute safe harbor
protections for these drug rebates.
Do you agree that greater transparency should be required to
understand how manufacturers and PBMs are negotiating prices and
rebates to ensure that savings are passed down to beneficiaries?
Answer. Yes. We believe there should be greater transparency of the
financial arrangements between manufacturers and PBMs. In particular,
we believe we must change the system to ensure that patients receive
the benefit of the significant rebates and discounts that manufacturers
like Merck pay to PBMs and plans. The administration's proposed rule is
a positive step in that direction.
Based on our initial assessment of the proposed rule, we believe
that it will remove misaligned incentives within the system, drive more
transparency in the system, and most importantly, lower beneficiaries'
out-of-pocket costs.
Question. Senator Thune asked if this administration rule would
lead you to lowering list prices. Both of you answered that you would
be likely to lower your prices. However, if this rule were finalized
tomorrow as proposed, would any of your companies be required to lower
the list price of any of your drugs?
Answer. Under the proposed rule, there is no requirement to lower
list prices. However, over time, we expect that our list prices will go
down if the misaligned incentives across the system are addressed. It
is also important to note that if the rule is implemented, Medicare
beneficiaries' out-of-pocket costs will be reduced, independent of any
lowering of list prices, since their cost-sharing will be based on the
net price. Nonetheless, we believe the rebate rule will align
incentives in a way that will restrain list prices.
pbms
Question. An Axios article from March 7, 2019 highlights the fact
that, while ``pharmaceutical companies put a lot of the blame for high
drug prices on pharmacy benefit managers,'' many large pharmaceutical
companies ``rely on PBMs to manage their own health-care benefits.''
In your role as an employer, does your company contract with a
pharmaceutical benefit manager (PBM) to administer the prescription
drug benefits for your employees and negotiate lower drug costs on your
behalf?
For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the prescription
drug benefit for your employees, how do you utilize the rebates your
PBM negotiates to lower health care costs or drug costs for your
employee plans and what does your company do with that savings?
Specifically, do the savings go toward lowing premiums?
For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the prescription
drug benefit for your employees, does your PBM offer point-of-sale
rebates to your employees?
Answer. Merck offers a generous health care benefit for our 24,000
U.S. employees. There is no deductible for medications covered under
our pharmacy benefit, and employees never have to pay more than $50 for
a retail prescription for a covered medication, and in most cases pay
less. We contract with a PBM for management of the prescription drug
benefits for our employees, and the benefit does not offer point-of-
sale rebates to our employees. Merck uses savings generated by the PBM
on rebates to lower overall costs for employees while ensuring low out-
of-pocket costs.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse
Question. Please describe any policy changes you support that would
result in your company lowering the list prices of its drugs.
Answer. Over time, we expect that our list prices will go down if
the misaligned incentives across the system are addressed. Nonetheless,
we believe the rebate rule will align incentives in a way that will
restrain list prices.
As we stated when we reduced the list price of several of our
products in July 2018, we have continued to look for opportunities to
reduce our list prices. We think the proposed rule would help create
those opportunities, but it can't happen overnight. All of the players
in the ecosystem will need to adjust to the new model.
If the proposed rule is implemented as written, it would only apply
to our contracts with PBMs and health plans for Medicare Part D and
Managed Medicaid. If PBMs and health plans maintain the rebate model in
the commercial market, we would still have commercial contracts based
on rebates, which would be subject to the existing constraints to
lowering list price. We also would still need a mechanism to revalue
drug in the distribution channel in a financially viable manner.
Question. How much does your company's research and development
portfolio rely on taxpayer-funded research conducted by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH)? How many of your company's products are
based, at least in part, on NIH research, and how many are the result
of research funded solely by your company?
Answer. The U.S. leads the world in biomedical research thanks to a
robust biomedical ecosystem comprised of important and unique
contributions from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), academic
institutions, and the biopharmaceutical industry. Historically, the
NIH's focus has been on basic biomedical science and research
concerning public health (including in the recent budget funding for
drug and alcohol abuse prevention, reducing health-care disparities,
and other important causes). Through this basic research, NIH seeks to
understand the fundamental biological processes and leverage that
understanding to determine which processes are involved in the
development and progression of disease. There is significant basic
research that in some respects contributes to all new medicines. Most
of this is considered ``pre-competitive'' since the individual
contributions are in themselves too small or too broad to lead directly
to a new therapy, which takes considerable work to invent and develop.
Merck also conducts basic research. However, where we use
intellectual property that others have created, we are diligent in
recognizing and agreeing on terms to use that property (including
financial compensation), which may include with agencies of the U.S.
government such as NIH. After this stage of basic research, our
company's further role is to then engage in the most risky and costly
part of discovery--to invent something that's never existed in the
history of the world that will alter the targets that come from basic
research and unlock treatments and cures for disease. This invention is
then followed by extensive clinical trial programs to demonstrate
safety and effectiveness.
On occasion, we will rely on work by government agencies that is
more advanced; however, we take the same approach of respecting
intellectual property rights and agreeing on terms of use of that
property. For example, Merck, along with Instituto Butantan, has
licensed certain rights from National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of NIH, for the development of live
attenuated tetravalent vaccines (LATV).
All parts of the ecosystem are needed to continue to lead in
biomedical research: the portion of NIH's entire $33 billion budget
that it devoted to biomedical research in 2017 as well as the $70
billion the biopharmaceutical industry spent in 2017--$10 billion of
which was spent by Merck--to invent and bring to market new treatments
and cures.
Question. In each of the last 5 years, how much has your company
spent on research and development versus the advertising and marketing
of your products?
Answer. In 2018, Merck incurred $9.8 billion in research and
development costs globally, the vast majority of which was conducted in
the U.S. Since 2010, Merck has invested nearly $70 billion in R&D to
create new medicines and vaccines that address the greatest health
challenges of our time--including antimicrobial resistance, Ebola, HIV,
and cancer--to save and improve lives around the world. In 2018, Merck
spent about $2.3 billion in the U.S. on direct marketing and selling
expenses. This number includes all sales and marketing expenses,
including creative development of resources and headcount related to
all marketing and sales activity in the U.S. market.
For the remaining years, we spent the following:

In 2017, Merck invested $10.3 billion in R&D and $2.5
billion in U.S. marketing and selling expenses.

In 2016, Merck invested $10.3 billion in R&D and $2.5
billion on U.S. marketing and selling expenses.

In 2015, Merck invested $6.8 billion in R&D and $2.4 billion
on U.S. marketing and selling expenses.

In 2014, Merck invested $7.3 billion in R&D and $2 billion
on U.S. marketing and selling expenses.
Question. During the hearing, you mentioned that your company would
be likely to lower the list prices of its drugs if the recent proposal
by the Trump administration to change the current system of rebates was
extended to the private market.
If the policy was extended to the private market, how large would
the list price reductions be relative to the size of the rebates your
company is currently providing?
Answer. It is hard to predict an exact amount of list price
reduction if the rule were implemented as described. However, we
believe that removing the misaligned incentives from the system should
result in downward pressure on list prices. It is also important to
understand that different purchasers receive different levels of
discounts, based on the access provided for patients. So, there is not
a uniform ``rebate amount'' that could reduce the list price. Moreover,
we expect that the robust negotiations that occur today will continue
in the highly competitive Part D market, and we expect to realize the
same level of net price that we do today. In fact, we expect that there
could be additional pricing pressure under the new system, which could
lead to lower net prices.
Question. How will this proposal affect how your company sets the
list prices for new drug products?
Answer. Merck approaches pricing from the perspective of value.
This approach looks at the value that a medicine provides through
multiple lenses with the goal of reflecting its benefit to patients and
to society, while at the same time paying an appropriate return on
invested capital to our investors, to ensure that we are able to
sustain R&D. While each individual situation varies based on factual
circumstances and market dynamics, generally, we consider:

Value provided to patients--to what extent does a new
medicine or vaccine establish a new standard of care that has
the potential to significantly extend and improve patient
lives?

Value provided to health-care systems--to what extent does a
new medicine or vaccine reduce the costs associated with
hospitalization and other costly complications of disease if
not appropriately (or optimally) treated?

Unmet need--does a new medicine or vaccine address a
critically unmet medical need, where few or no treatments
exist?

Access--what is the ability of various customers around the
world--including national, regional or local institutional
payers, physicians, employers and patients--to pay for our
products?

R&D sustainability--given the long-term risk and cost of
capital, can we appropriately compensate our investors to
ensure continued investment in the kind of risky and capital-
intensive research and development that will bring forward
medically important breakthroughs?

Competition--what are the costs of other treatments
currently on the market relative to the value provided by
Merck's products?
We do not expect this approach to change based on the Trump
administration's proposed rule.
Question. If the proposal is finalized and not extended to the
private market, will your company make any list price reductions? If
so, how large would the reductions be relative to the size of the
rebates your company is currently providing?
Answer. We expect that the robust negotiations that occur today
will continue in the highly competitive Part D and commercial markets,
and we expect to realize the same level of net price that we do today.
In fact, we expect that there could be additional pricing pressure
under the new system, which could lead to lower net prices, but
predicting the size of any such reductions is difficult.

Question Submitted by Hon. Maggie Hassan
Question. In June of 2018, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access
Commission (MACPAC) unanimously recommended under Recommendation 1.1 in
their annual report to Congress that Congress remove the statutory
requirement that manufacturers blend the average manufacturer price
(AMP) of a brand drug and its authorized generic.\13\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Program,'' https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Improving-
Operations-of-the-Medicaid-Drug-Rebate-Program.pdf.
This requirement created an unintended loophole. Rather than use
the price of the authorized generic, drug companies can sell its
authorized generic to a corporate subsidiary at an artificially lower
price and use that lower price to bring down the AMP, which in turn
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
lowers the rebate obligation.
Does your company engage in this practice? Has your company ever
engaged in this practice in the past?
Answer. No. Merck does not engage in the practice of selling
authorized products to a subsidiary and then blending the pricing data
for the products. Merck does engage with third parties who act as our
authorized generic partners. Merck has disclosed the methodology used
to account for these transactions in AMP to CMS.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
Question. As a portion of your revenue, for what percentage of the
drugs in your portfolio do you offer no rebates? Based on the drugs in
your pipeline, do you foresee that portion growing? For those drugs is
your list price equal to your net price?
Answer. Since Merck's entire product portfolio is covered within at
least one government program that requires a mandated rebate or
discount (such as Medicaid, 340B, Federal Supply Schedule), there are
no Merck products that are not rebated or discounted. Merck also offers
voluntary rebates or discounts on many of its products. We would expect
similar rebates and discounts to be paid for our drugs in the pipeline,
barring fundamental changes in the marketplace.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you generate in US sales
revenue? Please include specific figures.
Answer. In 2018, Merck incurred $9.8 billion on research and
development costs globally, the vast majority of which was conducted in
the U.S. Since 2010, Merck has invested nearly $70 billion in R&D to
create new medicines and vaccines that address the greatest health
challenges of our time--including antimicrobial resistance, Ebola, HIV,
and cancer--to save and improve lives around the world. In 2018, Merck
had $18.2 billion in U.S. sales revenue.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
administration? What company functions do you consider to be included
in administration? Please include specific figures.
Answer. In 2018, Merck incurred $9.8 billion in research and
development costs globally, the vast majority of which was conducted in
the U.S. Since 2010, Merck has invested nearly $70 billion in R&D to
create new medicines and vaccines that address the greatest health
challenges of our time--including antimicrobial resistance, Ebola, HIV,
and cancer--to save and improve lives around the world. In 2018, Merck
spent about $10.1 billion on marketing, selling, and administration
globally ($2.6 billion of which is directly attributed to the U.S.
market). This number includes all sales and marketing expenses,
including creative development of resources and headcount related to
all marketing and sales activity, as well as administrative expenses
associated with business support functions, including information
technology, human resources, facilities, finance, legal, and others.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
sales? What company functions do you consider to be included in sales?
Please include specific figures.
Answer. In 2018, Merck incurred $9.8 billion on research and
development costs globally, the vast majority of which was conducted in
the U.S. Since 2010, Merck has invested nearly $70 billion in R&D to
create new medicines and vaccines that address the greatest health
challenges of our time--including antimicrobial resistance, Ebola, HIV,
and cancer--to save and improve lives around the world. In 2018, Merck
spent about $6.9 billion on direct marketing and selling expenses
globally ($2.3 billion of which is directly attributable to the U.S.
market). This number includes all sales and marketing expenses,
including creative development of resources and headcount related to
all marketing and sales activity in the U.S. market.
Question. Why do you advertise for the drugs you manufacture? What
factors do you consider in choosing which drugs you advertise?
Answer. Merck believes that direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertising
can be an important and helpful way to inform patients about diseases
that may be relevant to them and therapeutic options they may want to
discuss with their physician. Data demonstrate that DTC can have a
positive impact on patient health in terms of diagnosis, treatment, and
adherence to prescribed therapies. We recognize that DTC is one channel
amongst many to help educate patients. Print materials, telephone,
websites, and other channels are also used to provide more in-depth
information to patients. The ultimate decision to prescribe a product
for any specific patient remains with the physician following
discussion with their patient.
Merck adheres to FDA regulations and guidelines governing DTC
promotion and has a long-standing policy to voluntarily submit new DTC
broadcast advertising campaigns to FDA for pre-review. Merck also
follows the PhRMA Guiding Principles for DTC Advertisements About
Prescription Medicines. We are currently considering what additional
information we can make available to consumers to ensure that they can
make informed health care decisions.

Prepared Statement of Richard A. Gonzalez,
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, AbbVie Inc.
I am Richard Gonzalez, and I am the chairman and chief executive
officer of AbbVie, a company dedicated to developing new innovative
medicines for some of healthcare's most challenging diseases, such as
cancer, Alzheimer's, viral infections, and auto-immune diseases. Since
our inception in 2013, AbbVie has invested approximately $50 billion in
pursuit of that goal. However, because we are tackling medicine's most
challenging problems, solutions do not come easily or without
significant risk. Where we have succeeded, we have been able to provide
cures for fatal diseases like hepatitis C and significantly alter the
disease progression for certain cancers, lessening the burden of
illness on patients and the health-care system. This is what the 30,000
employees of AbbVie are dedicated to doing.
We agree that access to lifesaving medicines is a critical issue
and we look forward to sharing our perspectives with you. There is no
one solution to this complex issue, but AbbVie is open to working with
the committee on how we can commit our resources to better partner in
your efforts to address pharmaceutical pricing and access. AbbVie and
the rest of our industry must play a role in solving these issues and
be prepared to work together with the insurance industry, the
administration and you to find a better path forward for American
patients.
My remarks today will focus on one aspect of this inquiry--the
Medicare Part D benefit design, which even after pharmaceutical list
prices are lowered, still contributes to making innovative therapies
cost-prohibitive for Medicare patients. In general, the Medicare Part D
program has worked well. Its market-based structure and utilization of
formularies encourages competitive price discounts that have yielded
significant savings to the government since the Part D benefit was
established in 2006. However, despite these cost savings, Part D
patients' out-of-pocket costs have significantly increased. Some would
blame that solely on high drug prices, and we agree that price should
certainly be part of the discussion. But it's also important to
acknowledge that science has enabled us to advance the standard of care
far beyond what was possible when the Part D benefit was designed.
Many of today's specialty medicines offer major advances in
treating or curing serious chronic or life-threatening conditions and
save significant amounts of money for the health-care system by
decreasing overall health-care costs, yet these therapies are also
costly. Due to the structure of the Part D benefit design, patients are
charged out-of-pocket costs on a medicine's list price which does not
reflect the
market-based rebates that Medicare receives. We are encouraged by the
proposed rule that would reflect manufacturer discounts in patients'
Part D out-of-pocket payments. This is an important step in the right
direction, but we believe more must still be done to help Part D
patients.
Let me give you a recent real-world example that demonstrates the
challenge with the current Part D benefit design and why the focus
solely on list prices does not fully address the access challenges. An
uncured hepatitis C infection leads to downstream medical costs for
surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation for patients who progress to
needing a liver transplant or having liver cancer. Today we can cure
hepatitis C with drugs. This cure is highly cost-effective for the
overall health-care system.
In 2017, AbbVie launched Mavyret, a highly effective cure for HCV.
At the time, the list prices for the competitive alternatives were as
high as $94,500 for their most commonly prescribed treatment duration.
We launched Mavyret at a list price that is 72 percent lower. But even
though we cut the list price of an HCV cure for most patients by 72
percent, Medicare Part D patients' out-of-pocket obligations are still
too high for many patients to access this medicine.
We believe it is important that discussions about access and
affordability include a focus on how to alleviate Medicare Part D out-
of-pocket burdens above and beyond just lowering list prices. We are
prepared to step up and discuss how companies like ours can shoulder
more of the burden of a patient's out-of-pocket expenses, as we do in
other areas covered by commercial insurance. Additionally, we believe
the discussion should also include the possibility of Medicare Part D
beneficiaries being able to purchase insurance (as they do in other
parts of the Medicare program) to cover more of their out-of-pocket
expenses.
We believe AbbVie, the rest of the pharmaceutical industry and
insurance providers should come together with the administration and
you to work toward solutions that make life-changing medicines more
affordable to Part D beneficiaries. I can assure you AbbVie is
committed to doing its part, and we look forward to working with you.

Questions Submitted for the Record to Richard A. Gonzalez \1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Please note that these responses were prepared by and are from
AbbVie Inc.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
Question. The Department of Health and Human Services' proposed
rule, ``Fraud and Abuse; Removal of Safe Harbor Protection for Rebates
Involving Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Creation of New Safe Harbor
Protection for Certain Point-of-Sale Reductions in Price on
Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Certain Pharmacy Benefit Manager
Service Fees,'' envisions that drug manufacturers will offer up-front
discounts rather than the back-end rebates that are now commonly
provided. Some observers argue that a 1996 court case called into
question whether manufacturers could offer up-front discounts,
resulting in today's rebate-based system. I've heard differing opinions
as to whether the issues related to the initial court case are still
relevant. If the HHS proposed rule is finalized, can you assure the
Committee that your company will offer up-front discounts? If not, why?
Please describe how you expect your company to respond to the HHS
proposed rule to eliminate safe harbor protection for back-end rebates
in Medicare Part D that is referenced above if it is finalized.
Assuming you are confident that antitrust laws do not prevent your
company from offering up-front discounts, specifically, do you envision
that your company lowers the list price of a drug to the current after-
rebate net price, offer discounts equal to the current rebate amount,
or a combination of both?
Answer. There has been significant discussion over the past several
months about proposals to eliminate rebates from Medicare Part D,
Medicaid, and the commercial market culminating in the administration's
publication of a proposed rule to ``expressly exclud[e] from safe
harbor protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) rebates on
prescription drugs paid by manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers
(PBMs), Part D plans, and Medicaid managed care organizations. The
proposal would create a new safe harbor protecting discounts offered to
patients at the pharmacy counter. Finally, the proposal would create
new safe harbor protection for fixed fee services arrangements between
manufacturers and PBMs.''
AbbVie is encouraged by the goals of the proposed rule to ensure
manufacturer discounts are reflected in and reduce patient cost sharing
under Part D. While we believe the rule is an important step in the
right direction, we also believe more should be done to help reduce the
out-of-pocket cost burden on Medicare Part D patients.
As for what the elimination of rebates might mean to the overall
health-care system or pharmaceutical companies, it is premature to
comment on these items until the administration's rule is finalized,
implementation timelines are solidified, and there are specific details
regarding how a new system without rebates will be structured and
function.
Question. To what extent are the back-end rebates your company
currently offers contingent on the amount of market share realized for
your drugs as a result of Part D plan formulary placement and other
techniques?
Answer. AbbVie does not have market-share based arrangements.
Question. Please provide a breakdown of percentage of sales that go
to each payer (including Medicare, Medicaid, private pay, other) and a
similar percentage by volume of the total number of each drug compared
to total volume. Please provide this data for the most recent year
available.
Answer. In 2018, on a U.S. dollars basis approximately 68 percent
of AbbVie's U.S. net sales were to commercial payers and approximately
32 percent were to government payers. AbbVie does not maintain this
information on a volume basis across all products. For Humira, AbbVie's
top product for sales, on a volume basis in the U.S. approximately 68
percent of Humira sales were to commercial payers and approximately 32
percent were to government payers. But on a U.S. dollars basis,
approximately 83 percent of Humira sales were to commercial payers and
only approximately 17 percent were to government payers.
Question. Do your companies hire consultants or lobbyists to
promote products at State Medicaid Pharmacy and Therapeutics
Committees? To whom do you disclose advocacy activities surrounding
State Medicaid programs, if at all?
Answer. AbbVie does not hire consultants or lobbyists to promote
products at State Medicaid Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committees. We
adhere to individual State's laws and regulations with respect to
advocacy disclosures.
Question. Please describe how the costs of patient assistance
programs are accounted for within your company's financial statements.
Please also describe the types of market information, such as
prescribing and use patterns, that your company collects from different
types of patient assistance programs and patient hub services.
Answer. The AbbVie Patient Assistance Program, which provides free
drug to eligible individuals, falls under the administration portion of
SG&A. AbbVie's commercial co-pay assistance costs are deducted from
gross sales.
The information that AbbVie collects through its patient support
services varies by products but may include demographic information,
diagnosis codes and prescription information, insurance information,
and claim information. AbbVie collects a more limited set of this data
through its Patient Assistance Program in order to assess patients for
eligibility and distribute medication to patients.
Question. Please provide a list of all contributions since January
1, 2014, that your company has made to any tax exempt organizations
working on issues related to drugs within your product lines, including
but not limited to patient groups, disease awareness groups, medical or
professional societies, universities or hospitals, industry
associations or leagues. for each contribution, please provide the name
of the organization that received the donation, the date the donation
was made, the amount of the donation, and a description of the purpose
of the contribution (i.e., was the contribution for the general fund, a

Question. Pay-for-delay agreements cost consumers and taxpayers
billions in higher drug costs every year. The FTC has gone after drug
companies that enter into these settlements where the brand pays the
generic company to keep its lower cost alternative off the market. I'm
the lead Republican sponsor of S. 64, the ``Preserve Access to
Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act,'' which would help put an end
to these deals.
Do you agree that these pay-off agreements keep drug costs high for
patients because they delay competition?
Has your company ever entered into these kinds of settlements with
a generic company?
Answer. ``Pay-for-delay'' is not a self-defining phrase. With
respect to the term ``pay,'' patent litigation settlements, like all
litigation settlements, involve compromise in which both sides believe
they are getting value from the resolution. There is no definition
explaining the circumstances under which that value would implicate the
term ``pay'' in ``pay-for-delay'' for purposes of these questions. And
with respect to ``delay'' virtually all patent settlements provide for
the generic competitor to enter the market before the expiration of the
patent at issue. So if the alternative resolution of a patent lawsuit
would be the innovator company continuing to enforce its patent until
expiration, then such a settlement, no matter what value is exchanged,
would actually accelerate competition, not delay it.
Question. Do you support the pay-for-delay bill?
Answer. AbbVie supports the goals of the Preserve Access to
Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act and would likely support the
bill upon clarification that enforcement only applies to agreements
after the date of enactment.
rebate traps/walls
Question. I'm increasingly concerned about the effect of so-called
``rebate traps'' or ``rebate walls'' on patients' access to quality,
lower-cost medicine. I understand there is ongoing litigation
challenging these practices as anti-competitive.
Does your company engage in the bundling of rebates over multiple
products? If so, why? And what benefit does the consumer gain from
that?
Does your company view these practices as anticompetitive or
harmful to patients' access to quality, lower cost medicine?
Answer. Rebates are a form of price competition that results from
the aggressive negotiations that occur between health plans (and their
representative PBMs) and pharmaceutical companies to provide patients
with access to medicines and treatments that can best help patients
manage their medical conditions.
Question. If a policy were adopted to eliminate rebates, or to
require that rebate savings be passed on to the consumer, would that in
and of itself solve the issue of rebate ``traps'' and ``walls''? And
would consumers benefit from such a policy?
Answer. There has been significant discussion over the past several
months about proposals to eliminate rebates from Medicare Part D,
Medicaid, and the commercial market culminating in the administration's
publication of a proposed rule to ``expressly exclud[e] from safe
harbor protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) rebates on
prescription drugs paid by manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers
(PBMs), Part D plans, and Medicaid managed care organizations. The
proposal would create a new safe harbor protecting discounts offered to
patients at the pharmacy counter. Finally, the proposal would create
new safe harbor protection for fixed fee services arrangements between
manufacturers and PBMs.''
AbbVie is encouraged by the goals of the proposed rule to ensure
manufacturer discounts are reflected in and reduce patient cost sharing
under Part D. While we believe the rule is an important step in the
right direction, we also believe more should be done to help reduce the
out-of-pocket cost burden on Medicare Part D patients.
As for what the elimination of rebates might mean to the overall
health care system or pharmaceutical companies, it is premature to
comment on these items until the administration's rule is finalized,
implementation timelines are solidified, and there are specific details
regarding how a new system without rebates will be structured and
function.
drug pricing
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider regulatory costs or compliance? If so, how specifically do
those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at least
one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
Answer. AbbVie does not consider regulatory costs or compliance
when considering the list price of a medicine.
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider the risk of liability or litigation? If so, how specifically
do those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at
least one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
Answer. AbbVie does not consider the risk of liability or
litigation when considering the list price of a medicine.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Pat Roberts
Question. What role do you see value-based arrangements (VBAs)
playing in the effort to reduce prescription drug costs? What potential
do these arrangements have to find the ``sweet spot'' between
controlling costs to patients and encouraging innovation of new drugs?
How can VBAs help lower what patients pay out-of-pocket?
Can Congress do more to allow for and encourage the use of VBAs?
Answer. Value-based arrangements can be an effective and market-
based solution to managing overall health-care costs when driven by
patient outcomes. Studies have found that 38 percent of payers with
outcomes-based contracts experience improved patient outcomes and 33
percent experience plan health-care cost savings. Additionally, plans
with outcomes-based contracts have been found to have a 28 percent
lower patient co-payment. All of these factors work towards moving
payment for prescription medicines away from volume-based approaches to
value-based models in a manner that appropriately balances patient
access with the appropriate use of medications to lower overall health-
care costs.
At AbbVie, we believe all our products provide value to patients
and the larger health-care system and are interested in the
possibilities that could arise through value-based contracting. To
further foster value-based arrangements, we support the reforms
included in the Patient Affordability, Value and Efficiency (PAVE) Act,
introduced by Senators Cassidy (R-LA) and Warner (D-VA).

Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
Question. We continue to hear that rebates negotiated off of the
list price of a drug are both good and bad.
Pharmacy benefit managers and plans have argued that rebates are
used to lower premiums across the board and that it is the best way to
seek a price concession on otherwise expensive drugs.
Your industry argues that these payers are insisting on higher
rebates that can only be achieved by raising list prices.
But patients often lose under this system, with out of pocket costs
being tied to list price. Insulin patients appear to be routinely
impacted by this perversity in the system.
Please explain to the committee how your company would reduce list
prices if rebates were no longer a part of the equation?
What assurance can you provide that you would in fact lower your
prices?
Answer. There has been significant discussion over the past several
months about proposals to eliminate rebates from Medicare Part D,
Medicaid, and the commercial market culminating in the administration's
publication of a proposed rule to ``expressly exclud[e] from safe
harbor protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) rebates on
prescription drugs paid by manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers
(PBMs), Part D plans, and Medicaid managed care organizations. The
proposal would create a new safe harbor protecting discounts offered to
patients at the pharmacy counter. Finally, the proposal would create
new safe harbor protection for fixed fee services arrangements between
manufacturers and PBMs.''
AbbVie is encouraged by the goals of the proposed rule to ensure
manufacturer discounts are reflected in and reduce patient cost sharing
under Part D. While we believe the rule is an important step in the
right direction, we also believe more should be done to help reduce the
out-of-pocket cost burden on Medicare Part D patients.
As for what the elimination of rebates might mean to the overall
health care system or pharmaceutical companies, it is premature to
comment on these items until the administration's rule is finalized,
implementation timelines are solidified, and there are specific details
regarding how a new system without rebates will be structured and
function.
Question. What actions should be taken to ensure that patients are
actually seeing the benefits of lower out-of-pocket costs?
Answer. Providing discounts to the patient at the point of sale is
an effective way of ensuring that patients can see lower out-of-pocket
costs. However, this is just the start. AbbVie believes that more must
be done.
The Medicare Part D benefit design contributes to making innovative
therapies cost-prohibitive for Medicare patients because patients are
charged out-of-pocket costs based on a medicine's list price, which
does not reflect the rebates that Medicare receives.
AbbVie believes it is important to alleviate the burdens that
patients face due to Medicare Part D out-of-pocket costs. AbbVie
supports solutions like a patient out-of-pocket cap in Part D and
smoothing patient out-of-pocket payments over a full year, so patients
have some predictability with respect to their out-of-pocket costs.
In addition, AbbVie is prepared to step up and discuss how
companies like ours can shoulder more of the burden of a patient's out-
of-pocket expenses.
As policymakers consider the impact of addressing out-of-pocket
costs in Medicare Part D, questions may arise around whether it will
lead to unnecessary utilization and wasteful spending. for specialty
medicines, increased utilization should not be misunderstood as
unnecessary or wasteful. Part D plans have tools, like step therapy
requirements for patients to first try lower cost alternatives before a
specialty medicine would be covered and prior authorization
requirements before a specialty medicine would be covered, to manage
the utilization of the majority of higher cost specialty medicines.
These tools ensure patients try a less costly medication first and have
met the clinical criteria for taking the specialty drug prescribed and
serve the function that an out-of-pocket cost obligation on patients
might serve to prevent unnecessary use.
Question. If rebates are driving high list prices for drugs as drug
manufacturers' claim, why do you think that Part B drugs, which have no
PBM rebates, are also seeing significant price increases? Whose fault
is that?
Answer. Manufacturers do offer rebates on Part B products in the
commercial market. Those rebates are included in the calculation of the
Part B Average Sales Price (ASP) and are therefore reflected in the
price Medicare pays for Part B drugs. AbbVie does, however, recognize
that increased competition in Part B could lead to additional savings
and welcomes the opportunity to engage in policy discussions that seek
to increase competition in Part B.
______
Question Submitted by Hon. Michael B. Enzi
Question. The Food and Drug Administration's drug review process is
known to many as the ``gold standard'' for evaluating medical products.
I've long thought that it is critical that we maintain public
confidence in their ability to ensure that drugs are safe and
effective. There is a perception among some, however, that biosimilars
might not be as safe as their reference products. That perception can
undermine patient and provider confidence. Do you believe that when FDA
approves a biosimilar, providers can be confident that it is safe and
effective?
Answer. Consistent with the US regulatory scheme for biosimilars,
we recognize that FDA-approved biosimilars are highly similar to the
reference product with no clinically meaningful differences.
Unlike small molecule generics, however, biosimilars do not contain
the identical active ingredient as their reference products and
biosimilars are not substitutable at the pharmacy for the reference
drug absent an FDA designation of interchangeability. As FDA has
acknowledged, multiple exposures to slightly different biologics can
prime the immune system to recognize subtle differences in structural
features between products, triggering or increasing the overall immune
response. Consequently, a finding of interchangeability must be
supported by additional data demonstrating that the biosimilar is
``expected to produce the same clinical result in any given patient,''
and that there is no risk to patients associated with alternating or
switching between the biosimilar and the reference product. There is no
requirement that two biosimilars found to be interchangeable with a
single reference product must show that it is safe and effective to
switch between the two interchangeable biosimilars, even though in
practice this is likely to happen in the marketplace if biosimilars are
treated like generic drugs. Different biosimilar products each found
interchangeable with a single reference product will have subtle
structural differences from each other. Indeed, there may be more
structural differences--or different types of structural differences--
between the two biosimilar products than between either biosimilar and
the reference product. As such, without clinical data assessing the
effects of switching between two biosimilars of the same reference,
there is no evidence to scientifically justify interchangeability or
automatic substitution between them. AbbVie has raised this concern
with FDA at a 2018 Part 15 Hearing held by the agency on the subject of
biosimilarity and interchangeability.
These fundamental distinctions between small molecule and biologic
medicine regulation should not change the perception that FDA-approved
biosimilars are safe and effective, but they are central to any
understanding of the biologics market and the appropriate use of these
complex products.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
re-evaluating business strategies in foreign countries
Question. Since taking office, President Trump has made reducing
drug prices one of his highest priorities--and has repeatedly spoken
about his frustration with the U.S. subsidizing the costs of
pharmaceuticals for the rest of the world. He has gone so far as to
issue proposals, like the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model, in
an attempt to bring down prescription drug prices.
With the increased scrutiny of the industry and of the drug supply
chain as a whole in the United States, have any of your companies re-
evaluated your business strategy in foreign countries?
If not, then why?
If a proposal, like IPI, were implemented, would it force your
companies to potentially ``walk away from the negotiating table when
other countries demand low prices subsidized by America's seniors,'' as
HHS Senior Advisor for Drug Pricing Reform John O'Brien has said?
Answer. The focus on U.S. versus ex-U.S. prices for pharmaceuticals
creates an erroneous impression that medicines are the major driver of
U.S. health care cost growth--ignoring that medicines account for a
small share of overall health spending. Many countries impose price
controls and restrict access to medicines in order to contain costs.
That is not the system we have here in the United States; nor should it
be. The U.S. fosters innovation and leads the world in drug discovery
and development with PhRMA members conducting nearly 80 percent of
their R&D in the United States. Importing or referencing price controls
used in other countries in the U.S. would challenge the innovation
model in a country the size of the U.S.
The U.S. relies on its competitive marketplace to manage costs,
while encouraging the development of new therapies. Because of the
ecosystem that exists in the U.S., patients enjoy access to innovative
medicines far earlier than patients in countries with centralized price
controls. Furthermore, most crosscountry comparisons focus solely on
the list prices of medicines and exclude from calculations the steep
discounts that are required in U.S. public programs such as Medicaid
and the rebates negotiated by insurers and pharmacy benefit managers in
Medicare Part D and the commercial market. In addition, these
comparisons often only include the list prices of brand-name medicines
even when lower-cost generic versions are available and widely used.
Instead of referencing price, AbbVie recommends policymakers focus
on reforms that address foreign freeloading in new trade agreements or
increasing enforcement of current agreements. We support enhancements
to trade agreements to balance share of investment costs. The United
States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), while not yet implemented,
contains improvements in intellectual property protections as well as
provisions requiring transparency in pricing and reimbursement
mechanisms. These elements are critical to ensuring trading partners
like Mexico and Canada appropriately value innovation, allowing
innovative biopharmaceutical companies to continue bringing new
medicines to the market.
Question. What are some of your ideas on how we can ensure
Americans aren't shouldering the full cost of pharmaceuticals?
Answer. Providing discounts to the patient at the point of sale is
an effective way of ensuring that patients can see lower out-of-pocket
costs. However, this is just the start. AbbVie believes that more must
be done.

might serve to prevent unnecessary use.
foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
Question. President Trump and Secretary Azar have both repeatedly
described their frustrations with ``foreign freeloading'' of U.S. drugs
in the last year.
``When foreign governments extort unreasonably low prices from U.S.
drug makers, Americans have to pay more to subsidize the enormous cost
of research and development. . . . It's unfair and it's ridiculous, and
it's not going to happen any longer.''
Do you agree that because of foreign countries' pricing and
reimbursement systems, U.S. patients and innovators are shouldering the
burden for financing medical advances?
How do foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement systems affect
our prescription drug costs?
Are foreign governments taking note of the concerns being raised by
the Trump administration and have they responded in any way?
Has there been any noticeable change in any of our trade agreements
since these concerns have been raised by the Trump Administration?
Answer. The focus on U.S. versus ex-U.S. prices for pharmaceuticals
creates an erroneous impression that medicines are the major driver of
U.S. health-care cost growth--ignoring that medicines account for a
small share of overall health spending. Many countries impose price

medicaid closed formulary proposals
Question. In an attempt to bring down drug costs, various states
have been exploring whether to exclude certain drugs from its Medicaid
program. for example, the state of Massachusetts' recently asked CMS
for permission to create a closed formulary where the state Medicaid
program would pick at least one drug per therapeutic class. CMS denied
their waiver request citing violation of federal law, but this proposal
does bring up important questions on how to contain drug prices in
state Medicaid programs.
If the principles of the Medicare Part D program--including the
necessary patient protections--were applied to state Medicaid programs,
do you think it lower drugs costs while ensuring access to patients?
Answer. Medicaid patients currently have broad access to medicines
with nominal co-pay amounts in exchange for steep mandatory rebates
provided by manufacturers. While the question does not specify what
``principles of the Medicare Part D program'' or ``necessary patient
protections'' are proposed to be applied to State Medicaid programs,
depending on the specific details that might be proposed, exclusionary
formularies could upset this broad patient access in Medicaid without
achieving corresponding savings over the already-existing steep
mandatory rebates.
medicaid ``best price''
Question. In the Trump administration's Blueprint, they suggested
that because drug manufactures have to give Medicaid the ``best price''
on drugs, there is no incentive to offer deeper discounts to other
payers--both government and commercial--than what is already offered
under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Does the Medicaid ``best price'' requirement encourage
manufacturers to increase initial prices?
What, if any, changes would you suggest we make to the program?
Answer. AbbVie has not found that best price requirements have
created incentives in the system to increase initial prices.
outcomes-based contracts
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you highlight your
support of outcomes-based contracts and how we need to be shifting our
system toward that approach.
How will these contracts lower drug costs for patients in both the
near term and long-term?
How will they lower overall health-care costs for our Federal
programs?
What have the preliminary results looked like so far?
Answer. Value-based arrangements can be an effective and market-
based solution to managing overall health-care costs when driven by
patient outcomes. Studies have found that 38 percent of payers with
outcomes-based contracts experience improved patient outcomes and 33
percent experience plan health-care cost savings. Additionally, plans
with outcomes-based contracts have been found to have a 28 percent
lower patient co-payment. All of these factors work towards moving
payment for prescription medicines away from volume-based approaches to
value-based models in a manner that appropriately balances patient
access with the appropriate use of medications to lower overall health-
care costs.
At AbbVie, we believe all our products provide value to patients
and the larger health care system and are interested in the
possibilities that could arise through value-based contracting. To
further foster value-based arrangements, we support the reforms
included in the Patient Affordability, Value and Efficiency (PAVE) Act,
introduced by Senators Cassidy (R-LA) and Warner (D-VA).
transparency/point of sale
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you express your
support for the Trump Administration's proposal to allow manufacturers
to provide PBMs up-front discounts that are passed onto patients at the
point-of-sale.
Do you feel like this proposal will make the transactions within
the drug supply chain more transparent?
If so, would this transparency bring down drug costs--overall and
for specialty drugs?
Answer. There has been significant discussion over the past several
months about proposals to eliminate rebates from Medicare Part D,
Medicaid, and the commercial market culminating in the administration's
publication of a proposed rule to ``expressly exclud[e] from safe
harbor protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) rebates on
prescription drugs paid by manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers
(PBMs), Part D plans, and Medicaid managed care organizations. The
proposal would create a new safe harbor protecting discounts offered to
patients at the pharmacy counter. Finally, the proposal would create
new safe harbor protection for fixed fee services arrangements between
manufacturers and PBMs.''
AbbVie is encouraged by the goals of the proposed rule to ensure
manufacturer discounts are reflected in and reduce patient cost sharing
under Part D. While we believe the rule is an important step in the
right direction, we also believe more should be done to help reduce the
out-of-pocket cost burden on Medicare Part D patients.
As for what the elimination of rebates might mean to the overall
health care system or pharmaceutical companies, it is premature to
comment on these items until the Administration's rule is finalized,
implementation timelines are solidified and there are specific details
regarding how a new system without rebates will be structured and
function.
the relationship between wholesalers and manufacturers
Question. When talking about the pharmaceutical supply chain, a lot
of focus has been placed on the Pharmacy Benefit Manager. But there's
another side of the equation that I'd like to ask about.
How do wholesalers negotiate pricing with manufacturers?
What impact does this have on drug costs?
What incentives or disincentives do they have to contain price
increases?
Answer. Wholesalers provide efficiencies in the distribution of
products for manufacturers, pharmacies and providers. They track supply
needs and maintain inventory levels consistent with patient need. They
also provide manufacturers with data and information related to both
historical purchasing patterns and projected future need, allowing
manufacturers to more accurately predict future supply needed in the
market to determine production needs. Wholesalers are also a ``one-stop
shop'' for sourcing medications and in some cases provide payer
contracting efficiencies through their Pharmacy Services Administrative
Organizations. This allows pharmacies to gain access to payer networks
efficiently, without negotiating with individual payers.
Manufacturers pay bona fide fees to wholesalers cover the costs of
the services described above.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
proposed rebate rule
Question. As has been done in many other settings, drug
manufacturers said during the hearing that one reason list prices for
drugs are high is that pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) demand
larger and larger rebates in order for the drug to receive favorable
placement on a formulary. You and your colleagues who testified during
the hearing stated if the Administration's proposal on changes to the
anti-kickback safe harbor for pharmaceutical rebates took effect, your
company would likely lower list price.
Like many Oregonians, I am skeptical drug manufacturers would
voluntarily lower their prices. Therefore, would you support
legislation that would (1) make similar changes the administration has
put forward related to Part D and Medicaid managed care, (2) change the
rebate system in a similar way to the proposal for the commercial
market, and (3) require drug makers to lower the list price of their
drugs equal to the amount of rebates provided today?
Answer. There has been significant discussion over the past several
months about proposals to eliminate rebates from Medicare Part D,
Medicaid, and the commercial market culminating in the administration's
publication of a proposed rule to ``expressly exclud[e] from safe
harbor protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) rebates on

medicaid drug rebate program
Question. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) requires
manufacturers to provide a basic rebate and an additional inflationary
rebate for both brand and generic drugs. The inflationary rebate is an
increasingly substantial part of total rebates due in large part to
large increases in drug prices that exceed inflation. Under current
law, this inflationary rebate is capped at 100 percent of Average
Manufacturer Price (AMP). This is the case even when manufacturers
continue to raise their prices well above inflation.
Please provide a list of all of your pharmaceutical products that
have reached the Medicaid AMP rebate cap in any of the 20 quarters from
January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018.
For each drug listed in response to question 1, please also provide
a list of which quarters and years each drug hit the cap.

medicaid drug rebate program compliance
Question. I am concerned about recent reports and legal settlements
surrounding drug manufacturers' failure to comply fully with the
requirements of the MDRP. for example, an analysis by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services office of Inspector General
found that between 2012 and 2016 taxpayers may have overpaid by as much
as $1.3 billion for 10 potentially misclassified drugs. That is why I
introduced the Right Rebate Act with Chairman Grassley to prevent drug
manufacturers from manipulating Medicaid to increase their profits.
However, I continued to be concerned about oversight and manufacturer
compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Accordingly, please describe the following:
Your company's current compliance plan and procedures used to
ensure compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program including internal audits or other checks you use to identify
compliance vulnerabilities.
Answer. AbbVie has established and maintains a comprehensive
compliance plan and procedures to ensure MDRP compliance, the core
components of which include policies and procedures relating to MDRP
issues, routine internal and external monitoring and auditing, and a
dedicated governance team to monitor and address any potential MDRP
issues.
Question. Any past or ongoing issues of non-compliance.
Answer. We are not aware of past or ongoing issues of non-
compliance with MDRP legal requirements.
Question. Any corrective actions taken to address identified
problems or issues of noncompliance with the MDRP and how such steps
were communicated to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Answer. We are not aware of past or ongoing issues of non-
compliance with MDRP legal requirements.
Question. Any steps taken to improve compliance and ensure that all
Medicaid drug rebates owed to the Federal Government and the States are
paid in full.
Answer. AbbVie conducts periodic reviews of its compliance plan and
updates its policies, procedures, and monitoring plans as needed to
ensure the company's continued implementation of MDRP legal
requirements.
bonus payments tied to specific drugs
Question. I am concerned by the potential for employee financial
incentives to encourage high launch prices and price increases for
prescription drugs.
Is your salary, bonus, or other compensation tied to sales or
revenue targets of a single product your company sells? Has it ever
been? If yes, please state the product or products to which your
salary, bonus or other compensation was tied.
Is your salary, bonus, or other compensation tied to either revenue
or net income of the company as a whole? Has it ever been? If yes,
please explain what assumptions about price increases are used when the
compensation committee sets revenue or net income goals. Does the
compensation committee provide any guidance to executives in regards to
the amount of revenue that the company will generate from price
increases versus volume growth?
Answer. To determine Mr. Gonzalez's 2018 annual incentive
compensation (sometimes referred to as a bonus), net revenues, income
before taxes, and Humira sales were three of several quantitative
financial metrics that were considered in addition to qualitative
factors. At most, a single quantitative financial metric had the
potential to impact up to 3 percent of Mr. Gonzalez's total
compensation, subject to additional qualitative and relative analyses.
No other compensation element, beyond the annual incentive
compensation, includes Humira sales, revenue, or net income as a
performance metric. While some specific details have differed somewhat,
the foregoing has generally been true in prior years as well.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez
Question. When new products enter the market, do drug companies set
high initial rebates and then provide deep rebates in order to gain
access to insurance plan's formularies?
Answer. Over the last 2 years, AbbVie has brought Mavyret and
Orilissa to patients. Mavyret is for the treatment of adults with
chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection across all major genotypes,
and Orilissa is the first and only oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone
antagonist specifically developed for women with moderate to severe
endometriosis pain. Mavyret was introduced with a list price below
competitive alternatives and Orilissa was introduced at a list price
below the current standard of care.
Rebates are a form of price competition that results from the
aggressive negotiations that occur between health plans (and their
representative PBMs) and pharmaceutical companies to provide patients
with access to medicines and treatments that can best help patients
manage their medical conditions. Plans/PBMs create formularies to list
brand and generic medicines.
Question. If CMS finalizes the rebate rule, do you anticipate
future products entering the market with significantly lower initial
list prices?
Answer. There has been significant discussion over the past several
months about proposals to eliminate rebates from Medicare Part D,
Medicaid, and the commercial market culminating in the administration's
publication of a proposed rule to ``expressly exclud[e] from safe
harbor protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) rebates on
prescription drugs paid by manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers
(PBMs), Part D plans, and Medicaid managed care organizations. The
proposal would create a new safe harbor protecting discounts offered to
patients at the pharmacy counter. Finally, the proposal would create
new safe harbor protection for fixed fee services arrangements between
manufacturers and PBMs.''
AbbVie is encouraged by the goals of the proposed rule to ensure
manufacturer discounts are reflected in and reduce patient cost sharing
under Part D. While we believe the rule is an important step in the
right direction, we also believe more should be done to help reduce the
out-of-pocket cost burden on Medicare Part D patients.
As for what the elimination of rebates might mean to the overall
health care system or pharmaceutical companies, it is premature to
comment on these items until the Administration's rule is finalized,
implementation timelines are solidified and there are specific details
regarding how a new system without rebates will be structured and
function.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Thomas R. Carper
Question. What are your recommendations for lowering prices for the
40 percent of drugs that do not offer rebates in Medicare Part D?
Answer. A majority of the discussion about the cost of prescription
drugs has been focused on list prices. We agree that price should be
part of the discussion, however we also know that solutions targeting
list price alone are not enough. Our experience in launching a low list
price HCV medicine made it clear to AbbVie and patients that list price
reductions will not always address patient affordability and access.
Providing discounts to the patient at the point of sale is an
effective way of ensuring that patients can see lower out-of-pocket
costs. However, this is just the start. AbbVie believes that more must
be done.
The Medicare Part D benefit design contributes to making innovative
therapies cost-prohibitive for Medicare patients because patients are
charged out-of-pocket costs based on a medicine's list price, which
does not reflect the rebates that Medicare receives.
AbbVie believes it is important to alleviate the burdens that
patients face due to Medicare Part D out-of-pocket costs. AbbVie
supports solutions like a patient out-of-pocket cap in Part D and
smoothing patient out-of-pocket payments over a full year, so patients
have some predictability with respect to their out-of-pocket costs.
In addition, AbbVie is prepared to step up and discuss how
companies like ours can shoulder more of the burden of a patient's out-
of-pocket expenses.
As policymakers consider the impact of addressing out-of-pocket
costs in Medicare Part D, questions may arise around whether it will
lead to unnecessary utilization and wasteful spending. for specialty
medicines, increased utilization should not be misunderstood as
unnecessary or wasteful. Part D plans have tools, like step therapy
requirements for patients to first try lower cost alternatives before a
specialty medicine would be covered and prior authorization
requirements before a specialty medicine would be covered, to manage
the utilization of the majority of higher cost specialty medicines.
These tools ensure patients try a less costly medication first and have
met the clinical criteria for taking the specialty drug prescribed and
serve the function that an out-of-pocket cost obligation on patients
might serve to prevent unnecessary use.
Question. In the health insurance plans that you offer your
employees, do you ask your insurers to pass through the full
manufacturer rebates to the beneficiaries?
Answer. AbbVie's benefit plans are structured to ensure employees
share in the cost of their prescription drugs but are also able to
access and afford their medicines, with the goal of maximizing
prescription drug adherence.
Currently our maximum co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums ensure
patient access and allow us to utilize rebates to reduce premiums. Our
benefit includes a deductible and 25-percent co-pay for prescription
medicines that is capped at $125 for a 30-day supply. For mail order or
specialty pharmacy, there is a 20-percent co-pay that is capped at $250
for a 90-day supply. Additionally, our benefit plans include an annual
out-of-pocket maximum. Our prescription drug adherence levels are high
year over year across many disease states.
To increase transparency, members receive a receipt at retail or
via mail/specialty pharmacies that reflects their share of the
discounted price of the drug.
AbbVie has considered the impact of passing through rebates to
employees and have found a minimal impact on employee out-of-pocket
expenses for all medicines, including specialty. We have found that it
would only reduce employee spending if the rebate reduced the co-
payment obligation below $125 for drugs filled at retail or $250 for
mail order or specialty drugs.
Employees who would benefit the most in this scenario would be
those in high deductible health plans before they meet their
deductible, however it could slow the time in which they would reach
their deductible.
While we have found that providing rebates at point of sale is most
beneficial to enrollees whose benefit design does not include a maximum
co-pay and therefore may not be beneficial to AbbVie employees, we are
continuing to assess the impact in a manner that ensures we can
maintain the current employee costsharing levels in our benefit design
that drive adherence.
Question. The systems for pricing and distributing drugs are opaque
and difficult to understand. What are your recommendations for
increasing transparency in how your companies set the list prices for
drugs, and for improving transparency in the supply chain for
prescription drugs? Would you support federal standards for
transparency in setting the list prices for drugs?
Answer. AbbVie supports transparency that is accurate, timely,
comprehensive and meaningful to patients as they make better-informed
decisions about their health care. This includes broad transparency
across the entire health-care system and consistent requirements,
including for all entities in the drug supply chain, rather than a
narrow focus on one individual sector. It is also important that any
new transparency requirements are prospective and balanced with
appropriate protections for confidential, proprietary information so as
not to undermine competition in the marketplace. As Congress considers
approaches to address transparency at the Federal level, AbbVie
welcomes further discussion on this important topic.
Question. In nearly every sector of the health-care industry,
Medicare, Medicaid, employers, and insurers are moving away from fee-
for-service payments to reimbursements based on value and performance.
Prescription drugs and medical devices were the glaring exceptions to
this trend until recently. How many of your drugs are included in
valuebased contracts and how many patients are benefiting from them?
How do these valuebased contracts work to lower drug prices for both
patients and taxpayers?
Answer. Value-based arrangements can be an effective and market-
based solution to managing overall health-care costs when driven by
patient outcomes. Studies have found that 38 percent of payers with
outcomes-based contracts experience improved patient outcomes and 33
percent experience plan health-care cost savings. Additionally, plans
with outcomes-based contracts have been found to have a 28 percent
lower patient co-payment. All of these factors work towards moving
payment for prescription medicines away from volume-based approaches to
value-based models in a manner that appropriately balances patient
access with the appropriate use of medications to lower overall health-
care costs.
At AbbVie, we believe all our products provide value to patients
and the larger health care system and are interested in the
possibilities that could arise through value-based contracting. To
further foster value-based arrangements, we support the reforms
included in the Patient Affordability, Value and Efficiency (PAVE) Act,
introduced by Senators Cassidy (R-LA) and Warner (D-VA).
Question. Last year, Senator Portman and I did an investigation on
the pricing of an opioid overdose reversal drug called EVZIO,
manufactured by Kaleo. Kaleo increased the price of EVZIO from $575 in
2014 to $4,100 in 2017. We found that the best price Medicare was able
to get for EVZIO, about $4,000, was much higher than the price other
federal programs and private insurers were able to get. It seemed that
Kaleo was able to get this higher price of $4,000 from Medicare by
helping doctors fill out paperwork showing that the drug was medically
necessary, even though there are cheaper alternatives on the market. As
a result of the investigation, Kaleo announced it will bring a generic
version of the drug to market at only $168 per pack. Are any of your
companies providing medical necessity paperwork to doctors in order to
get your drugs covered by Medicare?
Answer. Unlike the scenarios raised in this question, AbbVie does
not have a practice of completing medical necessity sections on any
reimbursement forms, purporting to make medical necessity
determinations that should be made by physicians, or submitting medical
necessity forms to payors on behalf of patients or physicians.
Question. In 2017, the Rand Corporation estimated that biosimilar
drugs, which are competitors to complex, biologic drugs, could save the
United States more than $50 billion over the next decade. Some of you
have also argued that increasing the use of biosimilar drugs would help
lower drugs costs for consumers and taxpayers. What is delaying the
uptake of biosimilar drugs in the United States? What policies do you
recommend to increase the development of biosimilar drugs?
Answer. AbbVie believes that FDA's current, patient-centered and
science-based approach to the development of standards governing the
approval of biosimilars--including interchangeable biosimilars--helps
to build a sustainable biosimilar market as patients and health care
providers become more exposed to, and comfortable with, these products.
The agency's approach best ensures the approval of quality, safe, and
effective biosimilar products--products that will instill confidence
among patients and prescribers. A robust and competitive biologic
marketplace cannot survive without this stakeholder confidence and
support.
Any policies regarding the biologics market must take into
consideration the fundamental differences between small molecule
generics and biosimilars. Consequently, competition between biosimilars
and their reference products will necessarily more closely resemble
brand-to-brand competition. A key principle for encouraging appropriate
market competition for biological products, then, is ensuring a level
playing field for all biologic products. Artificially favoring either
biosimilars or innovator biologics in coverage or reimbursement creates
market inefficiencies by reducing incentives to compete on price.
Moreover, policies designed to artificially drive usage of either the
biosimilar or the reference biologic risk confusing stakeholders
regarding the clear regulatory distinctions between biosimilars and
small-molecule generics. Robust competition should therefore be driven
by an increasing number of innovator and biosimilar products competing
to treat disease at the lowest possible cost.

world to allow prescription drug manufacturers to advertise directly to
consumers through magazines, billboards, radio, and television
commercials. While I will not argue that it is beneficial to educate
consumers about an unfamiliar disease and encourage them to seek
medical help, most commercials from all of your companies recommend
asking about a specific brand name drug, not a medical condition.
Furthermore, even if your advertisements follow all FDA rules and list
medication side effects, they also almost always list these while a
smiling, apparently healthy person is walking on a beach.
Researchers say that this type of imagery, combined with viewing
hours of drug commercials each month, leads consumers to underestimate
the risks associated with medications. for the past decade, studies
have shown that aggressive direct-toconsumer advertising is associated
with rising drug prices and an increase in inappropriate drug
prescriptions.
Since researchers have concluded that consumers are
misunderstanding the benefits and risks described in your ads, what
further policies could help you and your colleagues ensure that you are
educating patients in a clear manner?
Answer. We believe it is unlikely that DTC advertising would lead
to an ``increase in inappropriate prescriptions'' for AbbVie's largely
specialty-product portfolio. Both commercial insurance and Part D plans
have tools, like step therapy requirements for patients to first try
lower cost alternatives before a specialty medicine would be covered
and prior authorization requirements before a specialty medicine would
be covered to manage the utilization of the majority of higher cost
specialty medicines. These tools ensure patients try a less costly
medication first and have met the clinical criteria for taking the
specialty drug prescribed.
Further, we believe that consumers understand the benefits and
risks described in AbbVie's advertisements. AbbVie goes beyond the FDA
regulations to ensure its advertising it accurate, truthful, not
misleading, and reflects an appropriate balance between the risks and
benefits of the drugs. This includes complying with PhRMA's voluntary
principles on direct to consumer advertising.\2\ Some of the key
principles addressing the issues of educating patients in a clear
manner include:
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ See http://phrmadocs.phrma.org/files/dmfile/PhRMA--Guiding--
Principles_2018.pdf.

Companies that choose to feature actors in the roles of
health-care professionals in a DTC television or print
advertisement that identifies a particular product should
acknowledge in the advertisement that actors are being used.
Likewise, if actual health-care professionals appear in such
advertisements, the advertisement should include an
acknowledgment if the health-care professional is compensated
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
for the appearance.

DTC television advertising that identifies a product by name
should clearly state the health conditions for which the
medicine is approved and the major risks associated with the
medicine being advertised.

DTC television and print advertising should be designed to
achieve a balanced presentation of both the benefits and the
risks associated with the advertised prescription medicine.
Specifically, risks and safety information, including the
substance of relevant boxed warnings, should be presented with
reasonably comparable prominence to the benefit information, in
a clear, conspicuous and neutral manner, and without
distraction from the content. In addition, DTC television
advertisements should support responsible patient education by
directing patients to health care professionals as well as to
print advertisements and/or websites where additional benefit
and risk information is available.

All DTC advertising should respect the seriousness of the
health conditions and the medicine being advertised.
AbbVie believes these are important principles that all
pharmaceutical advertisements should follow. Our approach of listening
to, and learning from, consumers, caregivers, physicians and other
health-care professionals continues to confirm our belief that
accurate, balanced and timely information about our prescription
medicines and the conditions they treat is an essential component of
our commitment to putting patient health first.
pharmaceutical companies continue to raise prices
Question. As you are well aware, high prescription drug prices are
the number one concern for Americans and their families. According to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average
American spends around $1,208 annually on prescription drugs. There
have been several instances where brand name or even generic drugs that
have been on the market for years continue to increase in price.
One of the most well known examples is Mylan's increase of the
price of EpiPen from less than $100 in 2007 to more than $600 in 2016.
Another example, is the everincreasing price of insulin. Sanofi
increased the price of a vial of Lantus from $88.20 in 2007 to $307.20
in 2017. And those are just a small sample of price increases.
Why don't we see price decreases for drugs that have been on the
market for years without new formulations or added benefit?
Answer. Price often does decrease for drugs that have been on the
market for years. The U.S. has a robust and well-functioning system
with fast entry of generic medicines following the expiration of patent
and market exclusivities for brand medications. When generics medicines
enter the market price reductions can be dramatic. In fact, GAO has
found that prices are typically reduced by 20 percent for each new
generic entrant to the market. From 2005 to 2013 prices of medicines
commonly used to prevent cardiovascular disease dropped 92 percent. The
daily cost of the top 10 therapeutic classes of medicines most commonly
used by Medicare Part D enrollees dropped from $1.50 to $0.77 from 2006
to 2013.
In addition to dramatic decreases in price, generic uptake is swift
in the U.S. When a generic version of a medicine becomes available for
the first time, it captures an average of three-quarters of the market
within 3 months. Some generics captures as much as 90 percent in that
same time period. Utilization is also the highest in the U.S. when
compared to uptake in other markets, such as the UK, France, Japan,
Germany, and Australia. According to the 2018 Medicare Trustees Report,
the generic utilization rate for Part D beneficiaries has steadily
increased each year, from 75 percent in 2010 to 88 percent in 2017.
Competition is also robust among branded products. From 2005 to
2011, the time only one medicine was available in its class declined
from a median of 10 years in the 1970s to close to 2 years from 2005-
2011. Half of second medicines were approved within 2.3 years and one
quarter were approved within just 4 months. These competitive forces
lead to manufacturers offering discounts. An analysis by IQVIA found
that net prices for brands continued to increase more slowly than
invoice prices from 2013 to 2016, with average price increases for
brands at 9.2 percent (down from 12 percent in 2015) and net price
growth increases at 3.5 percent. For the same year, the analysis found
that rebates, discounts, and other price concessions offset price
growth for brand medicines by 62 percent.
pay for delay
Question. Pay for delay is a tactic that more and more branded drug
manufacturers have been using to stifle competition from lower-cost
generic manufacturers. This allows you to sidestep competition by
offering patent settlements that pay generic companies not to bring
lower-cost alternatives to market.
These ``pay-for-delay'' patent settlements benefit both brand-name
pharmaceutical companies by helping them avoid costly patent litigation
and general manufacturers by rewarding them a hefty sum to delay
entering the market with a cheaper drug alternative. However, these
deals do not benefit consumers. According to an FTC study, these
anticompetitive deals cost consumers and taxpayers $3.5 billion in
higher drug costs every year.
Does your company partake in pay-for-delay settlements?
Why would a pharmaceutical company enter into a pay-for delay
agreement?
Do you think these agreements stifle competition and prevent
generic alternatives to your branded medications?
Answer. ``Pay-for-delay'' is not a self-defining phrase. With
respect to the term ``pay,'' patent litigation settlements, like all
litigation settlements, involve compromise in which both sides believe
they are getting value from the resolution. There is no definition
explaining the circumstances under which that value would implicate the
term ``pay'' in ``pay-fordelay'' for purposes of these questions. And
with respect to ``delay'' virtually all patent settlements provide for
the generic competitor to enter the market before the expiration of the
patent at issue. So if the alternative resolution of a patent lawsuit
would be the innovator company continuing to enforce its patent until
expiration, then such a settlement, no matter what value is exchanged,
would actually accelerate competition, not delay it.
drug rebate rule
Question. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services'
(HHS) office of Inspector General (OIG) promulgated a new regulation to
remove regulatory safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback
Statute (AKS) for rebates on prescription drugs rebates paid by
manufactures to PBMs under Medicare Part D and for Medicaid managed
care organizations (MCOs). The OIG proposal attempts to ban most
rebates by eliminating their regulatory protections.
The rule is predicted to increase net drug costs in its early
years. The CMS actuaries estimate it would cost $196 billion over 10
years. Despite this high price tag, the beneficiary benefits are
limited. The proposed rule notes that under the CMS Actuary's analysis,
the majority of beneficiaries would see an increase in their total out-
of-pocket payments and premium costs; reductions in total cost sharing
will exceed total premium increases.
I wanted to ask a question about the administration's rebate rule,
which I understand that many of the drug manufacturers, and your main
trade association, strongly support. According to an analysis of the
rule by the Office of Actuaries at CMS, drug manufacturers are likely
to initially retain 15 percent of the current rebates as higher net
drug prices.
Given that estimate, can you provide the committee with any
assurances that prices will not increase under this proposed rule?
Answer. There has been significant discussion over the past several
months about proposals to eliminate rebates from Medicare Part D,
Medicaid, and the commercial market culminating in the administration's
publication of a proposed rule to ``expressly exclude[e] from safe
harbor protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) rebates on
prescription drugs paid by manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers
(PBMs), Part D plans, and Medicaid managed care organizations. The
proposal would create a new safe harbor protecting discounts offered to
patients at the pharmacy counter. Finally, the proposal would create
new safe harbor protection for fixed fee services arrangements between
manufacturers and PBMs.''
AbbVie is encouraged by the goals of the proposed rule to ensure
manufacturer discounts are reflected in and reduce patient cost sharing
under Part D. While we believe the rule is an important step in the
right direction, we also believe more should be done to help reduce the
out-of-pocket cost burden on Medicare Part D patients.
As for what the elimination of rebates might mean to the overall
health care system or pharmaceutical companies, it is premature to
comment on these items until the Administration's rule is finalized,
implementation timelines are solidified and there are specific details
regarding how a new system without rebates will be structured and
function.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
Question. According to an article recently published in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, medical marketers spent nearly $30
billion dollars in 2016, up from $17 billion in 1997. Direct-to-
Consumer (DTC) advertising had the biggest percentage increase: from
$2.1 billion, or 11.9 percent of all medical marketing, in 1997 to $9.6
billion, or 32 percent of total spending, in 2016.
Can each of you please provide what your ratio of spending on sales
and marketing to research and development is today?
Answer. AbbVie spends more on research and development than on
global sales, marketing, and promotion costs. The global sales,
marketing, and promotion spend in 2018 across all AbbVie products was
$4.24 billion. This is less than the $5.26 billion AbbVie spent on
research and development in 2018. And AbbVie's research and development
spend does not include acquired inprocess research and development
($424 million in 2018) or money invested externally for technology,
pharmaceutical compounds, or acquisitions. for example, AbbVie acquired
Pharmacyclics for $20.8 billion in 2015 and Stemcentrx for $6.4 billion
in 2016. The acquisition of both companies enhanced AbbVie's pipeline,
research and development, and clinical programs.
price-gouging
Answer. Sanofi, as I understand it, has made a pledge to the public
to limit its price increases to the national health expenditures growth
projection.
Would your company commit to a cap on annual price increases as
part of your PhRMA membership criteria?
Answer. With respect to the question's proposed collective
agreement by PhRMA members to cap annual price increases, we note that
in 1993, PhRMA (then known as PMA, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers
Association) sought review of such a proposal from the Antitrust
Division of the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice opined
that the proposed agreement for PhRMA members to collectively agree to
limit their price increases would be per se unlawful under federal
antitrust laws, even though the proposal was made ``in response to
concerns about controlling health care costs.'' (Oct. 1, 1993 letter
from Anne K. Bingaman, Assistant U.S. Attorney General, available at
https://www.justice.gov/atr/response-pharmaceutical-manufacturers-
associationsrequest-business-review-letter (``The PMA proposal is an
arrangement among competitors that limits individual pricing decisions
on its face. . . . An agreement among independent competitors that
interferes with free and open price competition by restraining
individual pricing decisions is a per se violation of the Sherman
Act.'').) The Department of Justice said it ``intend[ed] to bring suit
to challenge the program if PMA and its members go forward with its
proposal.'' AbbVie could not support a proposal that the Department of
Justice is on record as saying is unlawful and against which it would
file suit to block.
As for individual action, the same Department of Justice opinion
discussed above noted that, while collective agreements among
competitors raised antitrust violations, an individual company's
decision to limit its own price increases would not be problematic.
AbbVie in January 2017 became one of the first pharmaceutical companies
to commit to limiting increases of its list prices. AbbVie committed to
not more than one, single-digit price increase annually. AbbVie has
abided by that commitment.
Question. What policies would you propose to help ensure lower
launch prices for new drugs?
Answer. A majority of the discussion about the cost of prescription
drugs has been focused on list prices. We agree that price should be
part of the discussion, however we also know that solutions targeting
list price alone are not enough. Our experience in launching a low list
price HCV medicine made it clear to AbbVie and patients that list price
reductions will not always address patient affordability and access.
Providing discounts to the patient at the point of sale is an
effective way of ensuring that patients can see lower out-of-pocket
costs. However, this is just the start. AbbVie believes that more must
be done.
The Medicare Part D benefit design contributes to making innovative
therapies cost-prohibitive for Medicare patients because patients are
charged out-of-pocket costs based on a medicine's list price, which
does not reflect the rebates that Medicare receives.
AbbVie believes it is important to alleviate the burdens that
patients face due to Medicare Part D out-of-pocket costs. AbbVie
supports solutions like a patient outof-pocket cap in Part D and
smoothing patient out-of-pocket payments over a full year, so patients
have some predictability with respect to their out-of-pocket costs.
In addition, AbbVie is prepared to step up and discuss how
companies like ours can shoulder more of the burden of a patient's out-
of-pocket expenses.
As policymakers consider the impact of addressing out-of-pocket
costs in Medicare Part D, questions may arise around whether it will
lead to unnecessary utilization and wasteful spending. for specialty
medicines, increased utilization should not be misunderstood as
unnecessary or wasteful. Part D plans have tools, like step therapy
requirements for patients to first try lower cost alternatives before a
specialty medicine would be covered and prior authorization
requirements before a specialty medicine would be covered, to manage
the utilization of the majority of higher cost specialty medicines.
These tools ensure patients try a less costly medication first and have
met the clinical criteria for taking the specialty drug prescribed and
serve the function that an out-of-pocket cost obligation on patients
might serve to prevent unnecessary use.
transparency
Question. In many of your testimonies, you mentioned that the
current system of pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) back-end rebates
rarely results in a scenario where the PBM passes on savings to
consumers at the point of sale (POS). The administration recently
proposed a rule to eliminate the anti-kickback statute safe harbor
protections for these drug rebates.
Do you agree that greater transparency should be required to
understand how manufacturers and PBMs are negotiating prices and
rebates to ensure that savings are passed down to beneficiaries?
Answer. AbbVie supports price transparency across all stakeholders
that is accurate, timely, comprehensive, and meaningful to patients as
they make better-
informed decisions about their health care. This includes broad
transparency across the entire health-care system and consistent
requirements, including for all entities in the drug supply chain,
rather than a narrow focus on one individual sector. It is also
important that any new transparency requirements are prospective and
balanced with appropriate protections for confidential, proprietary
information so as not to undermine competition in the marketplace.
pbms
Question. An Axios article from March 7, 2019 highlights the fact
that, while ``pharmaceutical companies put a lot of the blame for high
drug prices on pharmacy benefit managers,'' many large pharmaceutical
companies ``rely on PBMs to manage their own health-care benefits.''
In your role as an employer, does your company contract with a
pharmaceutical benefit manager (PBM) to administer the prescription
drug benefits for your employees and negotiate lower drug costs on your
behalf?
For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the prescription
drug benefit for your employees, how do you utilize the rebates your
PBM negotiates to lower health-care costs or drug costs for your
employee plans and what does your company do with that savings?
Specifically, do the savings go toward lowing premiums?
For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the prescription
drug benefit for your employees, does your PBM offer point-of-sale
rebates to your employees?
Answer. AbbVie does use a PBM to manage pharmacy benefits for its
employees in the U.S. AbbVie's benefit plans are structured to ensure
employees share in the cost of their prescription drugs but are also
able to access and afford their medicines, with the goal of maximizing
prescription drug adherence.
Currently our maximum co-pays and out-of-pocket maximums ensure
patient access and allows us to utilize rebates to reduce premiums. Our
benefit includes a deductible and 25-percent co-pay for prescription
medicines that is capped per prescription at $125 for a 30-day supply.
For mail order or specialty pharmacy, there is a 20-percent co-pay that
is capped per prescription at $250 for a 90-day supply. Additionally,
our benefit plans include an annual out-of-pocket maximum. Our
prescription drug adherence levels are high year over year across many
disease states.
To increase transparency, members receive a receipt at retail or
via mail/specialty pharmacies that reflects their share of the
discounted price of the drug.
AbbVie has considered the impact of passing through rebates to
employees and have found a minimal impact on employee out-of-pocket
expenses for all medicines, including specialty. We have found that it
would only reduce employee spending if the rebate reduced the co-
payment obligation below $125 for drugs filled at retail or $250 for
mail order or specialty drugs.
Employees who would benefit the most in this scenario would be
those in high deductible health plans before they meet their
deductible, however it could slow the time in which they would reach
their deductible.
While we have found that providing rebates at point of sale is most
beneficial to enrollees whose benefit design does not include a maximum
co-pay and therefore may not be beneficial to AbbVie employees, we are
continuing to assess the impact in a manner that ensures we can
maintain the current employee cost-sharing levels in our benefit design
that drive adherence.

Question. How much does your company's research and development
portfolio rely on taxpayer-funded research conducted by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH)? How many of your company's products are
based, at least in part, on NIH research, and how many are the result
of research funded solely by your company?
Answer. The NIH performs important basic research that helps
scientific understanding. However, AbbVie spends its own money to do
the vast majority of its drug development and clinical trial work,
relying on the more than 8,000 people in research and development to
understand complex diseases and advance medicine. for the eleven AbbVie
drugs sold in the United States that have been approved since 2000, and
the two AbbVie drugs currently under review by the FDA, only two
received funding from the NIH for drug discovery. One of those drugs,
Orilissa, was developed by Neurocrine. Neurocrine received NIH funding
for drug development prior to AbbVie's collaboration with Neurocrine.
For the second, Kaletra, AbbVie's predecessor Abbott Laboratories
received an NIH discovery grant as part of an effort by the NIH to
encourage collaborative research among pharmaceutical manufacturers and
university research centers on protease inhibitors and to explore their
potential to treat HIV, a then uncontrollable and fatal disease. This
grant contributed to the development of one of the two active
ingredients in the drug. This grant, however, represented less than 1
percent of the total funding for Kaletra, with more than 99 percent of
the funding coming from Abbott.
In addition, for AbbVie's two oncology drugs--Venclexta and
Imbruvica--AbbVie has worked cooperatively with the National Cancer
Institute to conduct certain clinical trials. To date, these
cooperative trials have not resulted in any FDA approved indications
for these drugs.
Question. In each of the last 5 years, how much has your company
spent on research and development versus the advertising and marketing
of your products?
Answer. In each of the last four years, AbbVie has spent more on
research and development than it has on sales and marketing.

Question. During the hearing, you mentioned that your company would
be likely to lower the list prices of its drugs if the recent proposal
by the Trump administration to change the current system of rebates was
extended to the private market.
If the policy was extended to the private market, how large would
the list price reductions be relative to the size of the rebates your
company is currently providing?
How will this proposal affect how your company sets the list prices
for new drug products?
If the proposal is finalized and not extended to the private
market, will your company make any list price reductions? If so, how
large would the reductions be relative to the size of the rebates your
company is currently providing?
Answer. There has been significant discussion over the past several
months about proposals to eliminate rebates from Medicare Part D,
Medicaid, and the commercial market culminating in the administration's
publication of a proposed rule to ``expressly exclud[e] from safe
harbor protection under the Anti-Kickback Statute (AKS) rebates on

Question Submitted by Hon. Maggie Hassan
Question. In June of 2018, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access
Commission (MACPAC) unanimously recommended under Recommendation 1.1 in
their annual report to Congress that Congress remove the statutory
requirement that manufacturers blend the average manufacturer price
(AMP) of a brand drug and its authorized generic.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ MACPAC. ``Improving Operations of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program,'' https://www.macpac.gov/wpcontent/uploads/2018/06/Improving-
Operations-of-the-Medicaid-Drug-Rebate-Program.pdf.
This requirement created an unintended loophole. Rather than use
the price of the authorized generic, drug companies can sell its
authorized generic to a corporate subsidiary at an artificially lower
price, and use that lower price to bring down the AMP, which in turn
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
lowers the rebate obligation.
Does your company engage in this practice? Has your company ever
engaged in this practice in the past?
Answer. AbbVie does not engage in this practice and has not engaged
in this practice in the past. AbbVie only distributes, and has only
distributed, authorized generic versions of certain of its branded
products through authorized generic distribution and/or supply
agreements with third-parties that are wholly unrelated to AbbVie,
meaning a third-party entity that is not an affiliate or subsidiary of
AbbVie or otherwise owned by, controlled by, or under common control
with, in whole or in part, AbbVie. Those agreements are negotiated by
AbbVie and the third-party at arms-length and in good faith.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
Question. As a portion of your revenue, for what percentage of the
drugs in your portfolio do you offer no rebates? Based on the drugs in
your pipeline, do you foresee that portion growing? for those drugs is
your list price equal to your net price?
Answer. All of AbbVie's on-market medicines have some rebating/
discounting in one or multiple channels and we anticipate all of our
pipeline medicines will be similar.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you generate in US sales
revenue? Please include specific figures.
Answer. AbbVie spent $5.26 billion in research and development in
2018. AbbVie's research and development spend does not include acquired
in-process research and development ($424 million in 2018) or money
invested externally for technology, pharmaceutical compounds or
acquisitions. For example, AbbVie acquired Pharmacyclics for $20.8
billion in 2015 and Stemcentrx for $6.4 billion in 2016. In 2018, the
net revenues for products AbbVie sells in the United States was $21.52
billion. This includes revenues that are split with Janssen for
Imbruvica. While AbbVie's U.S net revenues are higher than its research
and development expense, AbbVie's global net income since it became an
independent company in 2013 is less than the over $50 billion it has
invested in that same time period to bring drugs to market.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
administration? What company functions do you consider to be included
in administration? Please include specific figures.
Answer. AbbVie spends more on research and development than on
global sales, marketing, and promotion costs. The global sales,
marketing, and promotion spend in 2018 across all AbbVie products was
$4.24 billion. This is less than the $5.26 billion AbbVie spent on
research and development in 2018. And AbbVie's research and development
spend does not include acquired inprocess research and development
($424 million in 2018) or money invested externally for technology,
pharmaceutical compounds or acquisitions. for example, AbbVie acquired
Pharmacyclics for $20.8 billion in 2015 and Stemcentrx for $6.4 billion
in 2016. However, adding the $3.16 billion spent in administration,
which includes overhead costs such as corporate human resources,
corporate finance, corporate ethics and compliance, corporate legal,
and corporate information technology, as well as other expenses such as
charitable donations, AbbVie spent a total of $7.4 billion in selling,
marketing, promotion, and administrative expenses (SG&A).
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
sales? What company functions do you consider to be included in sales?
Please include specific figures.
Answer. AbbVie spends more on research and development than on
global sales, marketing, and promotion costs. The global sales,
marketing, and promotion spend in 2018 across all AbbVie products was
$4.24 billion. This is less than the $5.26 billion AbbVie spent on

Pharmacyclics for $20.8 billion in 2015 and Stemcentrx for $6.4 billion
in 2016.
Sales and marketing includes the cost of AbbVie personnel in the
sales and marketing field, related overhead, the cost to develop
marketing and advertising materials, and the cost of placing
advertisements.
Question. Why do you advertise for the drugs you manufacture? What
factors do you consider in choosing which drugs you advertise?
Answer. Our goal in advertising is to provide those living with the
conditions that our drugs treat with the best information possible so
they can have an informed discussion with their health-care provider.
For many patients DTC ads are an important source of information about
new medicines, and advertising also plays an important role in raising
awareness of diseases, removing stigma from certain conditions, and
encouraging discussions with their health-care providers.

Prepared Statement of Hon. Chuck Grassley,
a U.S. Senator From Iowa
I want to welcome the witnesses and thank them for being here.
The information they share will help inform the committee as it
addresses the issue of high prescription drug prices.
America has a problem with the high cost of prescription medicines.
Whether it's about the EpiPen, insulin, or other prescriptions, in
the thousands of letters I've received, Iowans have made clear that
high drug prices are hurting them.
I've heard about people skipping doses of their prescription drugs
to make them last until the next paycheck.
I'm not a doctor, but rationing one's medicine doesn't sound like a
safe prescription for health and wellness.
Others have told me about leaving their prescription on the
pharmacy counter because it cost too much.
There is no question that researchers and doctors have developed
treatments and cures for diseases where there were once none.
And, such innovations take time and money.
But, we're all trying to understand the sticker shock that many
drugs generate. Especially when some of those drugs have been around
for a long time.
There is a balance between incentivizing innovation and keeping
prices affordable for consumers and taxpayers.
Like all systems, things can get out of balance.
The good news is, we are here to discuss solutions.
In fact, we are here today thanks to our system of checks and
balances.
Congress has a constitutional responsibility to be a meaningful
check on the spending of taxpayer money.
That responsibility includes not just holding hearings, but also
holding the private sector and the government accountable through
oversight.
Just like a doctor has to properly diagnose a disease before it can
be treated, Congress needs to understand what's going on in the drug
pricing supply chain in order to respond in a measured and effective
way.
As a part of that fact-finding, as of last Friday, Ranking Member
Wyden and I launched an inquiry into the high cost of insulin.
This hearing is not about scapegoating any one group regarding high
drug costs.
That's why we're holding a series of bipartisan hearings on the
issue.
Without a doubt, drug pricing is a complex issue.
But I think we should all be asking: Should it be so complex?
We cannot allow anyone to hide behind the current complexities to
shield the true cost of a drug.
And, we shouldn't turn a blind eye to industry practices that
thwart the laws and regulations designed to promote competition and
generic drug entry in the market.
Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, FDA Commissioner
Scott Gottlieb and the Federal Trade Commission have identified a
number of tactics that undermine competition--like withholding samples,
pay for delay, product-hopping, and rebate bundling, just to name a
few.
While these agencies are taking enforcement action or looking at
regulatory changes, we here in Congress are exploring legislative
options to deter companies from engaging in these practices that keep
drug prices high for patients.
Today, we expect open, honest answers from the pharmaceutical
industry to figure out how we got here and see what ideas they have to
make things better.
One of the first things we need to talk about is list price.
Secretary Azar has said that pharmaceutical companies believe that
the list price is meaningless.
In fact, some of your testimony today will echo that.
However, for a patient taking a drug that has no competition, the
list price is meaningful.
For seniors on Part D who are paying co-insurance as a percentage
of list price, the list price is meaningful.
For people who have high deductible plans and pay thousands of
dollars towards list price, the list price is meaningful.
For pharmacy benefit managers, providing drugs with a high list
price can be more attractive than providing a less expensive drug.
Therefore, for taxpayers, the list price is meaningful.
We've all seen the finger pointing. Every link in the supply chain
has gotten skilled at that.
But, like most Americans, I'm sick and tired of the blame game.
It's time for solutions.
One way or another, we're going to get some clarity.
The American people deserve straight answers and real solutions.
On that note, I want to remind each of you that it's a crime under
title 18, U.S. Code, section 1001 to provide false testimony to
Congress.
Thank you for coming. I look forward to your testimony.

Prepared Statement of Pascal Soriot,
Chief Executive Officer, AstraZeneca
i. overview
AstraZeneca appreciates the opportunity to engage with the
committee on the important topic of drug pricing in the United States.
We would like to emphasize our commitment to addressing these
challenges and the important issues raised by the committee regarding
drug pricing and affordability.
AstraZeneca is a global, science-led biopharmaceutical company that
focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization of
prescription medicines, primarily for the treatment of diseases in
three main therapy areas: Oncology; Cardiovascular; Renal and
Metabolism; and Respiratory. We are also selectively active in the
areas of autoimmunity, neuroscience, and infection. We are proud to
call Wilmington, DE home to our North American headquarters. We are
equally proud that one of our three global Research and Development
(``R&D'') headquarters is located in Gaithersburg, MD.
We are honored to contribute to improving the lives of millions of
patients in the U.S. and across the globe. This statement is focused on
four points explaining AstraZeneca's purpose, core values, and vision
for the future:

First, we are a science-led organization, as reflected in
our continued investment in R&D and our success in introducing
new treatments. Continuing to develop treatments that deliver
long-term benefits to patients and the overall health of the
U.S. population requires society's commitment to supporting
investment in innovation through purchasing our medicines for
the duration of patent protection at a responsible price that
allows for the recoupment of the investment and risk associated
with innovation.

Second, we believe medicines are part of the solution to
controlling health-care costs. They not only improve patient
outcomes and increase quality of life, but also reduce
downstream costs by keeping people healthy and out of the
hospital. This contribution to reducing overall health-care
costs should be considered when discussing drug pricing.

Third, we recognize that we are only able to improve the
lives of patients if they are able to take our medicines as
prescribed. To that end, we are committed to sustaining and
improving patient access and affordability.

Fourth, we recognize that the current state of drug pricing
in the U.S. health-care system is not sustainable and that
patients are facing increasingly high out-of-pocket costs. We
believe that these issues must be addressed urgently, and we
hope to be a constructive partner in finding solutions.
ii. benefits of innovation and r&d funding
Science is at the core of what we do, and we are focused on being
at the forefront of scientific innovation to deliver tomorrow's
treatments and cures. Since 2017, the Food and Drug Administration
(``FDA'') has approved 18 AstraZeneca products or significant
indications, and five of our products have received breakthrough
therapy designation. Breakthrough therapy designation is designed
specifically for the expedited development and review of drugs for
serious or life-threatening conditions, and these designations
highlight how critical our work is to patient health in the U.S. For
example, our oncology medicine CALQUENCE was granted breakthrough
therapy designation for certain patients with mantle cell lymphoma and
tezepelumab received such a designation for certain patients with
severe asthma.
In order to achieve these results, we reinvest a significant
percentage of our revenues in research to identify the next generation
of life-changing medicines. Over the past several years, we have worked
tirelessly to rebuild our R&D pipeline. We now have approximately 8,900
employees in our R&D organization working at sites across the world.
Our financial commitment to R&D has been significant. In 2018 alone, we
spent nearly $6 billion on R&D, or 28 percent of our total product
sales--a commitment to R&D that well exceeds the average spending of
our research-based peers.\1\ Over the past six years, even as our
revenues declined, we continued to make substantial investments in both
R&D and acquiring products for our pipeline. In 2018, these investments
have only just started to contribute to growth of our company.

2018-phrma-annual-membership-survey.
These results are possible only if society makes a commitment to
support innovation so that treatments can be developed to the benefit
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
of society as a whole for years to come.
The development of new drug therapies requires society to make an
up-front investment through purchasing our medicines during the patent
protection period at a responsible price we charge, and then at a very
substantially reduced price for an indefinite period after patent
expiry when generics are introduced. Thus, long-term improvements in
healthcare derived from new medicines can only be achieved if society
is willing to pay a responsible price for a certain number of years
that allows for the recoupment of the investment and risk involved in
pharmaceutical innovation. Improvements in patient health and reduction
of overall health-care costs over the long term are a direct result of
this commitment to support innovation.
For example, in the U.S., we have seen incredible progress in
reducing cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Between 2000
and 2014, age-adjusted mortality rates for cardiovascular and heart
disease declined by approximately 35 percent; several factors have
contributed to this decline, but the development of new medicines,
including cholesterol-lowering medicines like statins, has played an
important role.\2\ To take an AstraZeneca example, CRESTOR, a statin,
was approved by the FDA in 2003. A study of CRESTOR showed that it
reduced cardiovascular mortality and morbidity over the lifetime of the
patient compared to the standard of care, resulting in economic
value.\3\

10.3111/13696998.2010.499758.
It is important to note that there are significant risks involved
in developing new therapies. Only approximately 12 percent of therapies
entering clinical study are approved, and the average cost of
development approaches $2.6 billion.\4\ In 2018, return on R&D
investment among larger biopharmaceutical manufacturers fell to 1.9
percent, its lowest point since 2010.\5\ If we are not successful, we
lose our investment in the therapy. Although we are proud of our
success rate, we know that setbacks are inevitable when pushing the
boundaries of science. For example, in 2018, we announced with our
partner Lilly the discontinuation of Phase III clinical trials of
lanabecestat, an investigational treatment for Alzheimer's disease.
Such results are disappointing, but are an integral part of the nature
of scientific discovery.

Given the risks involved in developing a medicine, strong
intellectual property (``IP'') protections and exclusivity for
innovator products are a key component to ensuring that manufacturers
continue to develop therapies that benefit society as a whole. While
they create incentives to innovate, it is important to note that IP
protections and exclusivity for innovator therapies do not generally
prevent other competitor therapies from entering a given class,
allowing robust competition to exist; for example, there are seven
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
different statin molecules approved in the marketplace.
Once these protections expire, generic and biosimilar competitors
can enter the market, which further increases competition. Again,
taking CRESTOR as example, since 2016 when it lost exclusivity, over 16
generic forms have been approved and are available in the market today,
driving prices down very substantially. We strongly support this
construct and policy efforts to encourage competition. We describe
these proposals in section V of this statement.
Finally, it is also worth noting that a significant portion of our
R&D occurs here in the U.S. We invest more than $2.7 billion annually
in U.S.-based R&D work, employing approximately 2,700 people in our
science units within our R&D centers in Maryland, Massachusetts, and
California. Our approach to R&D is consistent with our broader and
long-standing commitment to U.S. jobs in research and manufacturing.
Our largest footprint is in this country, with 12,800 employees
throughout the U.S. Additionally, we recently completed a $200 million
expansion in our Frederick, MD facility where biologics, including
FASENRA for certain patients with severe asthma, and our immuno-
oncology therapy, IMFINZI, are manufactured. This sustained investment
in R&D leads to the creation of high-quality jobs and generates
economic value in the U.S.
To summarize, because we have put science and research at the
center of our company, we have had more success in our R&D pipeline
than ever before, delivering long-term healthcare benefits. This
success, however, is only possible if society remains committed to
supporting investment in innovation.
iii. value of medicines
The investments we make in researching and developing new therapies
cannot occur in a vacuum. We must also ensure that our medicines bring
value to patients, payers, and the health-care system as a whole.
We are only able to stand behind the value of our medicines if that
value is carefully and appropriately defined. In the health-care
industry and as part of policymaking, there is frequent reflection on
the meaning of ``value.'' We believe value must be assessed
holistically and include all costs related to the treatment of a given
condition. In particular, we must consider improvements in clinical
outcomes and quality of life as well as reduction of hospitalizations
and other medical costs.
Additionally, the future savings that prescription medicines can
bring to the healthcare system by preventing more costly interventions
should not be overlooked as their value is considered. A recent study
in Health Affairs of total Medicare spending per beneficiary from 1999
to 2012 found that the spending growth rate slowed to just 1.1 percent
per year on average since 2005. The study found that half of the total
slowdown was attributable to reduced spending growth on cardiovascular
diseases and events, like heart attacks and related conditions.
Increased medication use for conditions like hypertension, high
cholesterol, and diabetes explained half of that effect. The authors
noted that while large, even this impact of medications is likely to be
understated.\6\

Spending Growth Among the Elderly, 1999-2012. Health Affairs. February
2019. doi: 10.1377/hlthaff.2018.05372.
One of our own therapies--BRILINTA--is an example of a medicine
used in the cardiovascular setting that brings value to both patients
and the broader health-care system. This oral antiplatelet therapy is
indicated to reduce the rate of cardiovascular death, heart attack, and
stroke in patients with acute coronary syndrome (``ACS'') or a history
of heart attacks. For at least the first 12 months following the
diagnosis of ACS, BRILINTA has been shown to be superior to
clopidogrel, a generic oral antiplatelet. In addition, in patients with
ACS, BRILINTA in combination with aspirin resulted in 21 percent
reduction in cardiovascular mortality compared to clopidogrel in
combination with aspirin.\7\

clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndromes. N Engl J Med.
2009;361(11):1045-57. doi: 10.1056/NEJMoa0904327.
In addition, BRILINTA in combination with aspirin also resulted in
lower medical care costs compared to clopidogrel in combination with
aspirin. The lower medical costs are driven primarily by fewer hospital
readmissions and cardiovascular revascularization interventions--
resulting in medical care cost offsets of approximately $1,000 per
patient per year.\8\ This represents countless hours of patient time
better spent with family and friends than in the hospital.

Another example of the value that medicines can provide relates to
the relationship between diabetes and heart failure. In 2015, an
estimated 30.2 million adults in the U.S. had diabetes, with the vast
majority (90-95 percent) having type 2 diabetes.\9\ Up to 50 percent of
patients with type 2 diabetes may develop heart failure.\10\ The
prevalence of heart failure in the U.S. is expected to increase from
5.8 million in 2012 to 8.5 million in 2030.\11\ The total cost of heart
failure, which includes direct and indirect costs, is projected to
increase from $31 billion in 2012 to $70 billion in 2030, with the
majority of these costs (80 percent) related to hospitalization.\12\

Our oral type 2 diabetes product FARXIGA is a sodium-glucose
cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitor. This newest class of oral diabetes
medication has consistently demonstrated cardiovascular benefits for
diabetes patients that are absent in older diabetes treatments, further
supporting the importance of biopharmaceutical innovation. A recent
cardiovascular outcomes trial demonstrated that FARXIGA significantly
reduced the risk for hospitalization for heart failure or
cardiovascular death.\13\ With initial hospitalizations and
readmissions for heart failure in the Medicare population exceeding
$10,000 for each event in the U.S., it can be readily observed where
these new therapies can help further reduce total cost of care in the
most at-risk patient populations.\14\

In highly complex conditions, the measure of value and
effectiveness can be more multifaceted. In cancer, for example, there
are several end-points to measure effectiveness, such as progression-
free survival and overall survival. To account for this complexity,
cost-effectiveness studies for cancer therapies can measure the value
in providing the medication earlier in the course of treatment. An
example from our portfolio is IMFINZI--currently the only FDA-approved
immunotherapy for the treatment of patients with unresectable stage III
non-small cell lung cancer whose cancer has not progressed following
platinum-based concurrent chemoradiation therapy. Before IMFINZI,
patients in this setting underwent a period of ``watch and wait'' after
chemoradiation,\15\ and for up to 89 percent of these patients their
cancer was likely to spread further.\16\ Based on the PACIFIC trial,
IMFINZI may reduce the risk of death for these patients by nearly a
third.\17\

For a drug therapy to bring the most value to patients and the
health-care system, it is imperative that the therapy is reaching the
right patients at the right point in their treatment journeys. At
AstraZeneca, we are focused on improving outcomes for patients on a
personalized level by identifying the most appropriate treatments.
Approximately 90 percent of our pipeline now has a precision medicine
approach and reflects the broad range of cutting-edge technologies,
tissue diagnostics, next-generation sequencing and point of care
diagnostics we have introduced. By more precisely matching patients
with the right medicine, we bring greater value to payers and the
health-care system and help to ensure that patients receive the
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
specific therapy that is most appropriate for their treatment needs.
Finally, the concept of value is a key component in our pricing
determinations. AstraZeneca has always taken a thoughtful approach to
pricing, and we continue to do so, considering many factors. In
addition to our significant R&D investments, we consider clinical
value, size of patient population, government/payer coverage
requirements, patient affordability, competition and other market
conditions. We remain committed to pricing responsibly and making our
medicines available and affordable to patients.
iv. commitment to patient access and affordability
Although we are thoughtful in our approach to pricing, we know that
patients continue to face challenges at the pharmacy counter. We fully
recognize that drug therapies cannot bring value to the health-care
system or to patients unless they can access the medicines they need.
Our commitment to affordable access translates into a number of
resources and programs that have helped make our medicines available to
patients.
A. AstraZeneca Savings and Affordability Programs
To ensure that patients in the U.S. are aware of our affordability
programs, we were the first company to include messages about these
programs in all of our U.S. television advertisements. Since 2005,
every televised advertisement has reminded viewers: ``If you can't
afford your medication, AstraZeneca may be able to help.''
We stand behind this statement. Forty years ago, we were one of the
first manufacturers in our industry to establish a patient assistance
program to help low-
income patients obtain certain medicines free of charge. Through our
``AZ&Me'' program, we have provided prescription drug savings to more
than four million patients in the U.S. and Puerto Rico between 2008 and
2018.
In addition to AZ&Me, we offer extensive copay savings programs to
help eligible, commercially insured patients reduce copay costs at the
pharmacy. These copay savings programs are unfortunately not available
to Part D patients and this has created challenges for this population,
reducing adherence to important lifesaving or life-improving
treatments.
B. Value-Based Agreements
We are also working closely with payers and health systems to
explore innovative solutions to improve access and affordability that
demonstrate the value our medicines bring to patients and the health-
care system. For several years, AstraZeneca has been exploring these
types of solutions through value-based agreements where we are willing
to work with health-care stakeholders to tie payment to patient
outcomes.
To date, we have entered into approximately 40 value-based
agreements across our therapeutic areas with a variety of payers,
making AstraZeneca a leader in the field of value-based agreements. As
an example, AstraZeneca agreed with Express Scripts that for IRESSA, an
oral treatment for certain types of lung cancer, we will fully
reimburse Express Scripts for discontinued use before the third fill,
including if discontinuation occurs because patients did not respond to
treatment.
While most of these agreements have been focused on securing
patient access to our medicines and delivering better patient outcomes,
where payers are willing, we are also looking to more directly address
patient out-of-pocket affordability through these innovative
arrangements.
As an example, last month, we announced the initiation of a value-
based agreement for University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (``UPMC'')
Medicare patients who are prescribed BRILINTA. This value-based
contract, which was effective as of January 1, 2019, is groundbreaking
in two ways. First, the contract lowers the out-of-pocket costs for a
UPMC Medicare Part D patient to approximately $10 for a 30-day supply.
Second, what UPMC pays for BRILINTA will vary based on patient
outcomes, tying the cost of the drug to its real-world clinical
performance.
We are currently exploring another value-based agreement in
Medicare Part D. In addition to having a significant outcomes-based
component, this arrangement would reduce patient out-of-pocket costs.
This type of agreement allows patients to access their medicines at a
lower out-of-pocket cost and payers to control their overall health-
care costs through paying for outcomes.
However, there remain significant operational and regulatory
hurdles to the broader implementation of value-based agreements.
Operational challenges include capturing appropriate data and other
capabilities on the part of payers that are needed to successfully
execute these arrangements. For example, value-based agreements
typically require plans to have systems in place to report measures
like adherence and readmissions. While many payers and health systems
are evolving to meet the needs of the changing health-care environment,
greater investments need to be made in data capabilities. In addition,
policy and regulations must advance to support value-based agreements
in becoming a standard approach to reimbursement.
We believe that there are steps the government can take to address
these challenges to help encourage the timely adoption of value-based
agreements, including in public sector programs like Medicare. These
recommendations are described in more detail in section V of this
statement. Through the partnership of payers and policymakers, we look
forward to a future where implementation of value-based agreements
across public and private payers is widespread.
C. Discounts and Rebates
Finally, we negotiate rebates and discounts with payers and
pharmacy benefit managers (``PBMs'')--including in Medicare Part D--to
help ensure that our therapies have the most robust access possible.
Without providing these discounts and rebates, many life-savings
medicines would not be placed on plan formularies and therefore would
be largely unavailable to the patients who need them most. Our
estimates for 2018 show that across our products, our average rebate is
nearly 50 percent of our gross revenues in the U.S. Taking BRILINTA as
an example, approximately one third of gross revenue is provided back
in rebates. For most of our diabetes therapies, rebates well exceed 50
percent of gross revenues.
Over the past several years, discounts and rebates for our
therapies have increased overall, both in the commercial sector and
Part D. In recent years, in our primary care portfolio, which includes
the majority of our therapies, we have seen flat to declining net
effective prices to AstraZeneca for most of our products. Taking
CRESTOR as an example, in the 5-year period before it lost exclusivity,
even though list price increased, in 2011, CRESTOR's average net
effective price earned by AstraZeneca was $2.52 per day (one pill per
day). In 2016 when CRESTOR lost exclusivity, the average net effective
price was again $2.52.
However, discounts and rebates do not necessarily translate to
lower cost-sharing for patients. There are a series of factors that
impact a patient's out-of-pocket costs, including individual insurance
plan benefit design (copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles),
formulary placement, provider access, and assistance programs or
savings offers. As a science-led, patient-focused company, the fact
that many patients struggle with out-of-pocket costs despite the
discount and rebates we provide stands counter to our mission of
improving patient health.
v. the path forward: evolving the current system
Despite rapidly increasing rebate amounts, affordability of drug
therapies is an increasingly significant public policy and public
health issue. We agree that the current system is not sustainable--for
patients, payers, and society as a whole--and we are committed to
engaging across stakeholders to develop a new paradigm that improves
affordability and access for patients while ensuring that manufacturers
can continue to develop innovative therapies.
To achieve these goals of improving affordability and supporting
innovation, we must progress from a volume-based to a value-based
health-care system. We continue to be forward-leaning in this regard,
and we encourage other stakeholders to join us in the effort to deliver
and pay for health care, including drug therapies, in a more
affordable, efficient, and effective way.
An important step is to evolve the current system of paying for and
delivering drug therapies to one in which patients more directly
benefit from the discounts and rebates we provide. Specifically, we
believe that patient cost-sharing should be more aligned to a product's
net price as opposed to its list price, as is the case today.
However, as we look ahead to the future, even more must be done to
improve patient affordability and to truly build a health-care system
based on the value of therapies provided to patients.
A. Value-Based Agreements Should Be the Future Standard
First, in a future system, the default approach should be that
pricing and reimbursement for drug therapies are tied to patient
outcomes and the value the particular therapy provides. As such, it is
imperative that manufacturers and payers--including Part D plans--
engage in value-based agreements similar to the IRESSA and BRILINTA
examples referenced previously. Policies to encourage these
arrangements and to reduce or eliminate existing challenges will be
essential to their long-term success. To that end, AstraZeneca
appreciates the support of Senators Warner and Cassidy for value-based
agreements, as demonstrated by their requests for input on the Patient
Affordability Value and Efficiency (``PAVE'') Act. This draft
legislation would promote the development of value-based agreements by
offering increased flexibility for manufacturers to enter into such
arrangements, including with Medicare Part D plans.
In addition to the policies outlined in the PAVE Act, there are
other ways that the government could facilitate value-based agreements.
For example, the Department of Health and Human Services (``HHS'')
should consider how its recent proposed rule regarding PBM rebates can
be structured to protect existing and future value-based agreements. We
appreciate that HHS solicited comments on this topic, and we look
forward to sharing our perspective in our written comments to the
proposal. In addition, to encourage utilization of agreements that best
address the government's goals, we recommend that HHS develop a
prioritized list of clinical outcomes measures for manufacturers and
payers to consider when developing outcomes-based agreements.
Over the past several years, we have engaged with HHS, and
specifically the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation
(``CMMI''), to advance specific models involving our therapies in the
Medicare program. To date, we have not been able to execute on a model
with HHS or CMMI and the feedback we have received is that company-
specific models are challenging to implement. We look forward to
continued dialogue on these issues, and we hope to work with HHS, CMMI
and other stakeholders to develop a scalable framework in which
innovative models can be implemented in an appropriate way.
B. All Patients, Including Medicare Patients, Should Benefit From
Reduced Cost-Sharing
Second, a future system should be designed to ensure that all
patients benefit from lower cost-sharing, including those patients
taking drug therapies on the Part D specialty tier. A recent study
found that rates of prescription abandonment and delayed initiation of
oral cancer therapies increase as cost-sharing amounts rise.\19\ Such a
result reflects the need for a restructuring of the current benefit
design for specialty products.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\19\ Doshi JA, Li P, Petit AR, et al. Association of Patient Out-
of-Pocket Costs With Prescription Abandonment and Delay in Fills of
Novel Oral Anticancer Agents. J Clin Oncol. 2018; 36(5): 476-482. doi:
10.1200/JCO.2017.74.5091.
Under one potential approach, a portion of manufacturer discounts
could be used to fund a reduction in cost-sharing for patients facing
the highest cost-sharing amounts. This could be accomplished by
establishing a monthly or annual out-of-pocket cap, which would give
patients greater certainty in the total amount of out-of-pocket costs
they could face. The cap would provide a safety-net for patients that
could be funded by a portion of the discounts provided across all Part
D products. Such an approach would help ensure that more patients
benefit from the discounts manufacturers provide.
C. Use of Biosimilars Should Be Supported
Third, we believe that competition is a key component to reducing
costs, and that is why we support expanded use of biosimilars in the
U.S. As a global company, we operate in countries, particularly those
in the European Union, where biosimilar competition is particularly
robust. We support a similarly vigorous biosimilars market in the U.S.
We therefore appreciate the efforts of the FDA to increase the
availability of biosimilars in the U.S., including the FDA's
development of a Biosimilars Action Plan. We support efforts to
streamline and improve the efficiency of the biosimilars approval
pathway for the benefit of patients.
We also support reimbursement policies that facilitate the uptake
of biosimilars. Such policies include Medicare reimbursement rates that
ensure that biosimilars can compete on equal footing with innovator
products.
d. market-based competition should be maintained
Finally, it is imperative to maintain market-based competition
between manufacturers and between plans. Market-based competition plays
an important role in keeping costs down. This is how the lifecycle of
innovator therapies works today when competitors enter the market and
generic medicines become available over time.
The competitive market in the U.S. also provides patients with
access to innovative medicines faster. For example, American patients
have access to cancer medicines about 2 years earlier than patients in
other countries, including Germany, France, and the U.K.\20\ This
timely access to new cancer therapies is correlated with improved
survival rates; from 1997 to 2012, rates of cancer mortality fell by 20
percent in the U.S., compared to a 15 percent reduction in the U.K.\21\
Additionally, nearly 90 percent of newly launched medicines from 2011
to 2017 were available in the U.S., compared to just two-thirds in the
U.K., half in Canada and France, and one-third in Australia; and of 14
new diabetes medicines launched over that period, only one was
available in France.\22\ Given the benefits brought to patients by new
antidiabetic agents such as SGLT2 inhibitors (reduction in heart
failure and hospitalizations for heart failure), U.S. patients and
payers greatly benefit from the earlier introduction of these
innovative medicines.

While the current system needs reform, some of the benefits to the
current structure are the speed of access and reimbursement of new
medicines and the robust nature of the negotiations between
manufacturers and PBMs, which in turn creates competition between
manufacturers. As the system evolves, it is important that this ability
to compete is maintained. Therefore, there must be flexibility to
continue to negotiate net price by product and indication, among other
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
factors.
This flexibility is necessary not only to maintain competition, but
also to facilitate additional innovations in the way drugs are priced
and reimbursed. For example, variable discounts could be used to reduce
cost-sharing for patients over time as they remain adherent to their
medications. Additionally, we support the concept of indication-based
pricing, which recognizes that the value of a drug therapy with more
than one indication may vary based on indication. Indication-based
pricing would allow greater competition among manufacturers based on
the clinical efficacy of their therapies on an indication-by-indication
basis. Allowing discounts to vary based on the indication for which a
therapy is prescribed will be key to facilitating indication-based
pricing.
Finally, we would like to acknowledge that the coverage and
reimbursement policies in Medicare Part B have been criticized for not
sufficiently encouraging price competition for physician-administered
drug therapies. We are supportive of reforms in the Medicare Part B
program to address these concerns. Such reforms could include an
inflation penalty if a manufacturer's price increase exceeds a certain
threshold, as well as steps to ensure that the government and Medicare
patients more directly benefit from the discounts and rebates provided
in the commercial sector. Similar to the suggestion above on creating a
Part D out-of-pocket cap funded by a portion of manufacturer discounts,
the savings generated from an inflation penalty and increased
competition in Part B could be used to fund an out-of-pocket cap for
Medicare Part B patients.
Competition is a fundamental requirement to reducing costs over
time, both in Medicare Part B and Part D. Flexibility in the future
system will be necessary to maintain competition and to explore
additional innovations in the pricing and reimbursement of drug
therapies. We must also be willing to work together to improve the
efficiency of the Part B program. We look forward to working with
policymakers and other stakeholders to shape the future system to
accomplish these goals.
vi. conclusion
Although there is no single solution to the challenges we face, we
welcome the opportunity to speak with you about ways to evolve our
health-care system. We share your concern that many patients are facing
challenges with out-of-pocket costs, and we are committed to working
towards solutions that support patient access and affordability while
sustaining innovation. AstraZeneca, along with many others in the
pharmaceutical industry, is innovating to discover and develop
tomorrow's cures and treatments, and we know we need to be a
constructive partner to find solutions to ensure that patients benefit
from the therapies we develop.
______
Questions Submitted for the Record to Pascal Soriot
Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
Question. At the hearing, you testified that AstraZeneca does not
withhold samples from generic manufacturers in order to block generic
versions of your drug from entering the market. You also expressed your
support for the ``Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent
Samples Act,'' also known as the CREATES Act. However, the FDA has a
list on its website which identifies reference listed drug (RLD) access
inquiries where brand manufacturers may have prevented generic
companies from obtaining samples of products necessary to support FDA
approval. AstraZeneca is on this FDA list. This would appear to
contradict your testimony at the hearing that AstraZeneca has not
withheld samples of their products to delay generic competition.
Could you please explain in detail why AstraZeneca is on the FDA
list?
Answer. AstraZeneca appreciates the opportunity to address the
question of one of our medicines, BRILINTA (ticagrelor) appearing on
the Reference Listed Drug Access Inquiries list (RLD List). We would
first like to state that AstraZeneca supports allowing generic
manufacturers access to samples. Withholding or otherwise blocking such
access is inconsistent with that position. Our internal review has not
identified any unanswered, delayed, or outstanding requests for samples
of BRILINTA by any generic manufacturers.
It is our understanding that BRILINTA was included on the RLD List
based on a single inquiry received by the FDA. Unfortunately, the RLD
List does not identify the company that reportedly requested
information (or samples) from AstraZeneca, the date the information was
requested, or any other information that would allow AstraZeneca to
better understand or further investigate the circumstances of this
inquiry. On its website, the FDA does advise that it has ``not
independently investigated or confirmed the access limitations
described in the inquiries received.'' \1\ Given this limitation, the
listing of an inquiry on the RLD List does not mean that the FDA has in
fact determined that access to samples by generic manufacturers was
limited or withheld for the medicines identified. Indeed, based on our
internal review, we have not identified any circumstances that
substantiate the inquiry received by the FDA relating to BRILINTA.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Reference Listed Drug (RLD) Access Inquiries, U.S. Food and
Drug Administration, https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/
DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/
ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/
ucm607738.htm (last updated Feb. 7, 2019).
Question. Could you please explain in detail the discrepancy
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
between your testimony and the FDA list?
Answer. AstraZeneca is not aware of any instances where the company
has withheld or otherwise blocked access to samples by generic
manufacturers. Based on our internal review, AstraZeneca is not aware
of any unanswered, delayed, or outstanding requests for samples of
BRILINTA by any generic manufacturers.
In addition, BRILINTA is and has always been available via normal
commercial distribution channels (i.e., wholesalers) since its U.S.
launch. It has never had a restricted distribution program.
Finally, more than 15 generic manufacturers have applied for
regulatory approval from the FDA for the manufacture of generic
ticagrelor and some, like Watson/Teva, have received tentative
approvals from the FDA. Because conducting bioequivalence studies with
the branded medicine is an FDA pre-approval requirement, it is clear
that these generic manufacturers are not having difficulty accessing
branded ticagrelor for their studies.
In light of the context provided above, it is unclear why any
generic manufacturer would be unable to obtain a sample of BRILINTA for
their purposes or why an inquiry was lodged with the FDA related to
this medicine.
Question. Has AstraZeneca ever blocked access to samples?
Answer. AstraZeneca is not aware of instances where the company has
refused to sell samples or has otherwise blocked access to samples by
generic manufacturers.
Question. The Department of Health and Human Services' proposed
rule, ``Fraud and Abuse; Removal of Safe Harbor Protection for Rebates
Involving Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Creation of New Safe Harbor
Protection for Certain Point-of-Sale Reductions in Price on
Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Certain Pharmacy Benefit Manager
Service Fees,'' envisions that drug manufacturers will offer up-front
discounts rather than the back-end rebates that are now commonly
provided. Some observers argue that a 1996 court case called into
question whether manufacturers could offer up-front discounts,
resulting in today's rebate-based system. I've heard differing opinions
as to whether the issues related to the initial court case are still
relevant.
If the HHS proposed rule is finalized, can you assure the committee
that your company will offer up-front discounts? If not, why?
Answer. If the HHS proposed rule is finalized largely as proposed,
AstraZeneca intends to comply with its requirements and use point-of-
sale discounts.
Question. Please describe how you expect your company to respond to
the HHS proposed rule to eliminate safe harbor protection for back-end
rebates in Medicare Part D that is referenced above if it is finalized.
Assuming you are confident that antitrust laws do not prevent your
company from offering up-front discounts, specifically, do you envision
that your company lowers the list price of a drug to the current after-
rebate net price, offer discounts equal to the current rebate amount,
or a combination of both?
Answer. Assuming the HHS rebate rule is finalized largely as
proposed, AstraZeneca intends to comply with its requirements and use
point-of-sale discounts. Our goal is to maintain net prices broadly in
line with today, recognizing our ability to do so may be dependent on
external factors and market response such as how plans evolve their
benefit design and the total degree of transparency under the new
model.
AstraZeneca would plan to reduce list prices, pending reforms
across all payers, including in the commercial sector in addition to
Part D, as the current construct does not allow for two separate list
prices (i.e., one list price for Part D and a different list price for
the commercial sector). Therefore, we also support efforts to eliminate
rebates in the commercial sector, and recommend that Congress explore
such legislation. While eliminating rebates is an important step,
benefit designs must also be evaluated.
Question. To what extent are the back-end rebates your company
currently offers contingent on the amount of market share realized for
your drugs as a result of Part D plan formulary placement and other
techniques?
Answer. Our arrangements in Part D do not include a market share
component.
Question. Please provide a breakdown of percentage of sales that go
to each payer (including Medicare, Medicaid, private pay, other) and a
similar percentage by volume of the total number of each drug compared
to total volume. Please provide this data for the most recent year
available.

Question. Do your companies hire consultants or lobbyists to
promote products at State Medicaid Pharmacy and Therapeutics
Committees? To whom do you disclose advocacy activities surrounding
State Medicaid programs, if at all?
Answer. AstraZeneca does not utilize consultants or lobbyists to
promote medicines at State Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) Committees.
However, AstraZeneca Medical Affairs personnel may engage in peer-to-
peer medical discussions with members of the medical community
including Medicaid P&T committee members.
AstraZeneca has comprehensive internal policies that oversee
interactions between AstraZeneca employees and government officials.
Federal and state laws and regulations also govern lobbying activities,
and AstraZeneca complies with the attendant disclosure requirements.
Question. Please describe how the costs of patient assistance
programs are accounted for within your company's financial statements.
Please also describe the types of market information, such as
prescribing and use patterns, that your company collects from different
types of patient assistance programs and patient hub services.
Answer. AZ&MeTM Prescription Savings Program (Patient
Assistance Program):
In furtherance of its objective of ensuring patient access,
AstraZeneca was one of the first manufacturers in the industry to
establish a patient assistance program to facilitate access to certain
medicines for uninsured and underinsured low-income patients. This
program, known as AZ&Me, provides eligible patients with medicines at
no cost.
We account for the costs of medicines provided through the AZ&Me
program as a component of our Operating Expenses.
In connection with the AZ&Me program, AstraZeneca collects general
program enrollment data such as number of patients in the program and
medicine provided.
Access 360TM (Patient Hub):
AstraZeneca's patient hub, Access 360, is a reimbursement support
program that provides patients and their healthcare providers with
limited access and reimbursement support for AstraZeneca specialty care
medicines. Access 360 collects patient, provider and payer coverage
data in conjunction with appropriate patient opt-ins to administer the
limited reimbursement services offered by the program.
Question. Please provide a list of all contributions since January
1, 2014, that your company has made to any tax exempt organizations
working on issues related to drugs within your product lines, including
but not limited to patient groups, disease awareness groups, medical or
professional societies, universities or hospitals, industry
associations or leagues. For each contribution, please provide the name
of the organization that received the donation, the date the donation
was made, the amount of the donation, and a description of the purpose
of the contribution (i.e., was the contribution for the general fund, a
specific purpose to a specific program, or continuing medical
education). Please also note whether the contribution was unrestricted
or restricted; if it was restricted, please explain all restrictions.
Finally, if your company maintains a foundation or other separate
charitable arm, please provide the name of all such entities, and list
all donations made from that entity or entities.
Answer. Our commitment to improving the lives of patients goes
beyond our innovative medicines. We place significant value on
collaboration and partnerships, including work done by non-profits,
patient advocates, medical professionals, and researchers. To that end,
we provide support for eligible programs through corporate
contributions, research support, fellowships, and medical education
grants. We also support conferences and initiatives for healthcare
professionals and scientists.
AstraZeneca believes in providing information to the public about
our company, our medicines and about how we do business. In 2008, we
began publishing biannual reports of our contributions to nonprofit
organizations. We use contributions as our umbrella term for financial
support to nonprofit organizations contributing to the public good
(e.g., donations, sponsorships, and partnerships).
The below data reflects the total value of contributions made by
AstraZeneca to nonprofit organizations in the U.S. in the years 2014-

In addition, in 1993, AstraZeneca founded the AstraZeneca
HealthCare Foundation, a 501(c)(3) entity. The AstraZeneca HealthCare
Foundation aims to promote public awareness surrounding healthcare
issues, further public education and medical knowledge, and support
charitable and qualified exempt organizations whose work aligns with
the Foundation's charitable goals.
In furtherance of AstraZeneca's commitment to improving health, in
2010 the AstraZeneca HealthCare Foundation launched the Connections for
Cardiovascular HealthSM (CCH) program. With the mission of
improving cardiovascular health in the U.S., CCH awards grants to U.S.-
based nonprofit organizations whose work supports CCH's mission. Since
its launch, CCH has awarded nearly $23 million to 52 organizations
working to prevent cardiovascular disease.

Question. Pay-for-delay agreements cost consumers and taxpayers
billions in higher drug costs every year. The FTC has gone after drug
companies that enter into these settlements where the brand pays the
generic company to keep its lower cost alternative off the market. I'm
the lead Republican sponsor of S. 64, the Preserve Access to Affordable
Generics and Biosimilars Act, which would help put an end to these
deals.
Do you agree that these pay-off agreements keep drug costs high for
patients because they delay competition?
Answer. AstraZeneca has confidence in patents that protect our
medicines and, where appropriate, we file lawsuits to protect our
intellectual property.
AstraZeneca does not enter into ``pay-off agreements,'' if those
are understood to include settlements that pay generic competitors to
delay entry into the market. AstraZeneca engages in patent settlements
but we do not believe these resolutions contribute to increased prices.
In the absence of a settlement, a generic would not necessarily prevail
in the patent litigation and therefore would not be able to enter the
market. Indeed, AstraZeneca has entered into many early-entry patent
settlements that allow generic manufacturers to license innovator
patents and thereby permit generic competition before expiration of
AstraZeneca's patent rights.
Settlement agreements that permit entry of generic drugs before
expiration of relevant patent rights do not stifle competition but
instead permit early entry by resolving patent disputes that would
otherwise prevent generic alternatives to branded medication.
All of AstraZeneca's patent settlements fully comply with the law.
These settlements provide increased clarity and stability to both
parties, allowing innovators like AstraZeneca to continue investing
substantially in new medicines for patients and frequently allowing
generic competitors to enter the market before expiration of
AstraZeneca's patent rights.
Question. Has your company ever entered into these kinds of
settlements with a generic company?
Answer. AstraZeneca does not enter into settlements that pay
generic competitors to delay entry into the market.
Question. Do you support the pay for delay bill?
Answer. While AstraZeneca supports efforts to curb patent
settlement abuses, we have concerns about the Preserve Access to
Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act in its current form. For
example, the proposed legislation would be retroactive to 2013 and
would unfairly subject to potential scrutiny lawful settlements entered
into based on the then existing legal construct. As a general matter,
AstraZeneca believes that patent settlement agreements are pro-
competitive because they can permit entry of generic drugs before
expiration of relevant patent rights.
rebate traps/walls
Question. I'm increasingly concerned about the effect of so-called
``rebate traps'' or ``rebate walls'' on patients' access to quality,
lower cost medicine. I understand there is ongoing litigation
challenging these practices as anti-competitive.
Does your company engage in the bundling of rebates over multiple
products? If so, why? And what benefit does the consumer gain from
that?
Answer. AstraZeneca offers portfolio discount arrangements to
improve patient access and affordability across multiple medicines,
thus ensuring the right medicine can be prescribed for the right
patient. Portfolio discounting allows manufacturers and plans another
mechanism to negotiate for formulary access for the patient, in
addition to single-medicine discounts and rebates. Irrespective of the
approach to discounting, AstraZeneca also ensures discounts are
appropriately reported in government price reporting metrics (e.g.,
Best Price, Average Manufacturer Price, and Average Sales Price).
Question. Does your company view these practices as anticompetitive
or harmful to patients' access to quality, lower cost medicine?
Answer. AstraZeneca does not view these practices as
anticompetitive or harmful to patients' access. In fact, AstraZeneca
offers portfolio discount arrangements to improve patient access and
affordability.
Question. If a policy were adopted to eliminate rebates, or to
require that rebate savings be passed on to the consumer, would that in
and of itself solve the issue of rebate ``traps'' and ``walls''? And
would consumers benefit from such a policy?
Answer. AstraZeneca believes that evolving the current system of
paying for and delivering drug therapies to one in which patients more
directly benefit from the discounts and rebates that AstraZeneca
provides is an important step towards improving affordability and
supporting innovation. This can best be accomplished by eliminating
rebates in Medicare Part D and the commercial sector, which would
create competition between manufacturers on net price instead of rebate
amounts, thereby helping to eliminate rebate ``traps'' and ``walls.''
AstraZeneca also believes that patient cost-sharing should be more
aligned to a medicine's net price, and that eliminating rebates and
moving to a point-of-sale discount model should help accomplish this
goal. Additionally, it is important to note that lowering list prices
in the U.S. without addressing broader challenges, including benefit
design, will not improve affordability for many patients. While
eliminating rebates is an important step, benefit designs must also be
evaluated.
drug pricing
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider regulatory costs or compliance? If so, how specifically do
those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at least
one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
Answer. AstraZeneca does not directly consider regulatory or
compliance costs when setting the list price of a drug. AstraZeneca's
approach to pricing across all medicines is driven by a number of
factors, including clinical value, patient access and affordability,
patient population, government and payer coverage requirements, RandD
expenditures, manufacturing costs, and competitive dynamics.
AstraZeneca is mindful of healthcare costs and is continuously
exploring innovative opportunities and solutions to deliver medicines
while considering cost and value. In setting drug prices, AstraZeneca
takes into account both the budget impact to payers (including Medicare
and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs)) as well as patient out-of-pocket
costs to maintain patient access to needed medication. AstraZeneca has
also been a leading innovator in developing alternate payment
structures for its medicines. In particular, AstraZeneca has emphasized
value-based agreements, which, broadly speaking, seek to link access,
reimbursement or price, to a demonstrated clinical benefit or outcome.
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider the risk of liability or litigation? If so, how specifically
do those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at
least one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
Answer. AstraZeneca does not consider the risk of liability or
litigation when setting the list price for a particular drug.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Pat Roberts
Question. What role do you see value-based arrangements (VBAs)
playing in the effort to reduce prescription drug costs? What potential
do these arrangements have to find the ``sweet spot'' between
controlling costs to patients and encouraging innovation of new drugs?
Answer. We believe medicines are part of the solution to
controlling health-care costs. They not only improve patient outcomes
and increase quality of life, but also reduce downstream costs. Value-
based agreements allow us to reimburse the health-care system if our
medicines do not deliver as intended. This solution demonstrates our
willingness to stand behind the value of our medicines.
AstraZeneca is working closely with payers and health systems to
explore innovative solutions to improve access and affordability that
demonstrate the value our medicines bring to patients and the health-
care system. Our value-based agreements aim to manage the totality of
treatment costs and keep people healthy and out of the hospital. For
several years, AstraZeneca has been exploring these types of solutions
through value-based agreements where we are willing to work with
health-care stakeholders to tie payment to patient outcomes.
To date, we have entered into approximately 40 value-based
agreements across our therapeutic areas with a variety of payers,
making AstraZeneca a leader in the field of value-based agreements.
As an example, and as noted in the written testimony submitted to
the Senate Committee on Finance, AstraZeneca agreed with Express
Scripts that for IRESSA, an oral treatment for certain types of lung
cancer, we will fully reimburse Express Scripts for discontinued use
before the third fill, including if discontinuation occurs because
patients did not respond to treatment.
Question. How can VBAs help lower what patients pay out-of-pocket?
Answer. While most of these agreements have been focused on
securing patient access to our medicines and delivering better patient
outcomes, where payers are willing, we are also looking to more
directly address patient out-of-pocket affordability through these
innovative arrangements.
Our ambition is that these agreements will evolve to enable
reimbursement back to a payer to be shared with the patient when
medicines do not perform as expected.
As an example where a value-based agreement directly reduced out-
of-pocket costs for patients, we recently announced the initiation of a
value-based agreement for University of Pittsburgh Medical Center
(UPMC) Medicare patients who are prescribed BRILINTA. This value-based
contract, which was effective as of January 1, 2019, is groundbreaking
in two ways. First, the contract lowers the out-of-pocket costs for a
UPMC Medicare Part D patient to approximately $10 for a 30-day supply.
Second, what UPMC pays for BRILINTA will vary based on patient
outcomes, tying the cost of the medicine to its real-world clinical
performance.
We are currently exploring another value-based agreement in
Medicare Part D. In addition to having a significant outcomes-based
component, this arrangement would reduce patient out-of-pocket costs.
This type of agreement allows patients to access their medicines at a
lower out-of-pocket cost and payers to control their overall healthcare
costs through paying for outcomes.
Question. Can Congress do more to allow for and encourage the use
of VBAs?
Answer. We believe that there are steps the government can take to
address challenges and help encourage the timely adoption of value-
based agreements, including in public sector programs like Medicare.
For example, at this time, the current Anti-Kickback Safe Harbor
(AKS) regulations do not expressly address value-based agreements.
Accordingly, manufacturers must seek to structure value-based
agreements to meet the requirements of existing safe harbors from the
AKS, such as the discount safe harbor and personal services safe
harbor, that were created for purposes other than value-based
agreements. Although we believe that value-based agreements can
strongly benefit patients and the health-care system overall, the lack
of clarity in application of the safe harbors to value-based agreements
creates regulatory uncertainty that discourages broader implementation
of value-based agreements in public-sector programs.
In addition to the risk of AKS liability, value-based agreements
present other regulatory challenges that manufacturers must navigate.
For example, manufacturers must manage complex government price
reporting calculations that may not account for price fluctuations over
time that may be associated with a value-based agreement.
In a future system, the default approach should be that pricing and
reimbursement for drug therapies are tied to patient outcomes and the
value the particular therapy provides. As such, it is imperative that
manufacturers and payers--including Medicare plans--engage in value-
based agreements similar to the IRESSA and BRILINTA examples referenced
previously.
Policies to encourage these arrangements and to reduce or eliminate
existing challenges will be essential to their long-term success. To
that end, AstraZeneca appreciates the support of Senators Warner and
Cassidy for value-based agreements, as demonstrated by their requests
for input on the Patient Affordability Value and Efficiency (PAVE) Act.
This draft legislation would promote the development of value-based
agreements by offering increased flexibility for manufacturers to enter
into such arrangements, including with Medicare Part D plans by
addressing AKS and government pricing concerns.
This legislation is particularly important given the
administration's proposal to eliminate PBM rebates under the discount
safe harbor. Currently, many value-based agreements are structured
using a rebate agreement, under which the terms of a discount are based
on clinical or cost outcomes measures. Therefore, the elimination of
discount safe harbor protection for rebates without an exception for
value-based agreements could inadvertently reduce incentives for value-
based agreements, which we do not believe is the administration's
intent. We have therefore recommended to HHS that value-based
agreements are exempt from the proposed changes to the discount safe
harbor and we encourage members of Congress to support this exemption.
Through the partnership of payers and policymakers, we look forward
to a future where implementation of value-based agreements across
public and private payers is widespread.

Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
Question. We continue to hear that rebates negotiated off of the
list price of a drug are both good and bad. Pharmacy benefit managers
and plans have argued that rebates are used to lower premiums across
the board and that it is the best way to seek a price concession on
otherwise expensive drugs. Your industry argues that these payers are
insisting on higher rebates that can only be achieved by raising list
prices. But patients often lose under this system, with out of pocket
costs being tied to list price. Insulin patients appear to be routinely
impacted by this perversity in the system.
Please explain to the committee how your company would reduce list
prices if rebates were no longer a part of the equation?
Answer. Assuming the HHS rebate rule is finalized largely as
proposed, AstraZeneca intends to comply with its requirements and use
point-of-sale discounts. Our goal is to maintain net prices broadly in
line with today, recognizing our ability to do so may be dependent on
external factors and market response such as how plans evolve their
benefit design and the total degree of transparency under the new
model.
AstraZeneca would plan to reduce list prices, pending reforms
across all payers, including in the commercial sector in addition to
Part D, as the current construct does not allow for two separate list
prices (i.e., one list price for Part D and a different list price for
the commercial sector). Therefore, we also support efforts to eliminate
rebates in the commercial sector, and recommend that Congress explore
such legislation. While eliminating rebates is an important step,
benefit designs must also be evaluated.
Question. What assurance can you provide that you would in fact
lower your prices?
Answer. Assuming the HHS rebate rule is finalized largely as
proposed, AstraZeneca intends to comply with its requirements and use
point-of-sale discounts. Our goal is to maintain net prices broadly in
line with today, recognizing our ability to do so may be dependent on
external factors and market response such as how plans evolve their
benefit design and the total degree of transparency under the new
model.
AstraZeneca would plan to reduce list prices, pending reforms

the commercial sector). Therefore, we also support efforts to eliminate
rebates in the commercial sector and recommend that Congress explore
such legislation. While eliminating rebates is an important step,
benefit designs must also be evaluated.
Question. What actions should be taken to ensure that patients are
actually seeing the benefits of lower out-of-pocket costs?
Answer. In the absence of rebates, the market incentives for the
differential between list and net price should be reduced because
manufacturers will be competing on the basis of net price instead of
rebate amounts. Because Part D patient cost-sharing is currently based
on list price and not net price, this change may also result in lower
cost-sharing for patients. Additionally, it is important to note that
lowering list prices in the U.S. without addressing broader challenges,
including benefit design, will not improve affordability for many
patients. While eliminating rebates is an important step, benefit
designs must also be evaluated.
AstraZeneca also supports monthly and annual out-of-pocket caps in
Medicare Part D to further ensure that patients see the benefits of
lower out-of-pocket costs.
Question. If rebates are driving high list prices for drugs as drug
manufacturers' claim, why do you think that Part B drugs, which have no
PBM rebates, are also seeing significant price increases? Whose fault
is that?
Answer. For our Part B products, price increases are modest and
generally in line with inflation. We are supportive of competition,
including policies that support more widespread use of biosimilars.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Steve Daines
Question. As an advocate for improving Montanans' access to low-
cost medications, I've been a champion of the Creating and Restoring
Equal Access to Equivalent Samples (CREATES) Act, which would combat
anticompetitive practices used by some brand-name pharmaceutical
companies to block or delay competing generic drugs from entering the
market. During the hearing when I asked if your company had ever
withheld samples from generic manufacturers, you answered emphatically
no. Yet, according to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), generic
drug makers have made inquiries with the agency claiming they were
unable to access samples provided by Pfizer and AstraZeneca that are
needed to conduct studies to produce low-cost generic drugs.
Do you agree that denying generic drug manufacturers access to
samples keeps drug costs high for patients due to lack of competition?
Answer. AstraZeneca is supportive of allowing generic manufacturers
to have access to samples.
Question. Has your company refused to sell samples or placed any
barriers in the way of generic drug makers acquiring samples?
Answer. AstraZeneca is not aware of instances where the company has
refused to sell samples or has otherwise blocked access to samples by
generic manufacturers.
Question. Are you aware of any outstanding requests for samples?
Answer. AstraZeneca is not aware of any unanswered, delayed, or
outstanding requests for samples of our medicines by generic
manufacturers.
It is our understanding that one of our medicines, BRILINTA, was
included on the Reference Listed Drug Access Inquiries List (RLD List)
based on a single inquiry received by the FDA. However, BRILINTA has
always been available via normal commercial distribution channels
(i.e., wholesalers) and has never had a restricted distribution
program.
Unfortunately, the RLD List does not identify the company that
reportedly requested information (or samples) from AstraZeneca, the
date the information was requested, or any other information that would
allow AstraZeneca to better understand or further investigate the
circumstances of this inquiry. On its website, the FDA does advise that
it has ``not independently investigated or confirmed the access
limitations described in the inquiries received.'' Given this
limitation, the listing of an inquiry on the RLD List does not mean
that the FDA has in fact determined that access to samples by generic
manufacturers was limited or withheld for the medicines identified.
Indeed, based on our internal review, we have not identified any
circumstances that substantiate the inquiry received by the FDA
relating to BRILINTA.
Question. How does your company work to prevent abuses in the
sample system?
Answer. AstraZeneca is supportive of allowing generic manufacturers
to have access to samples and is not aware of instances that would be
considered abuse of the samples system.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
re-evaluating business strategies in foreign countries
Question. Since taking office, President Trump has made reducing
drug prices one of his highest priorities--and has repeatedly spoken
about his frustration with the U.S. subsidizing the costs of
pharmaceuticals for the rest of the world. He has gone so far as to
issue proposals, like the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model, in
an attempt to bring down prescription drug prices. With the increased
scrutiny of the industry and of the drug supply chain as a whole in the
United States, have any of your companies re-evaluated your business
strategy in foreign countries?
Answer. We continuously evaluate our business approaches in all
markets and adjust our strategies accordingly based on many factors,
including the overall environment.
Question. If not, then why?
Answer. See response above.
Question. If a proposal, like IPI, were implemented, would it force
your companies to potentially ``walk away from the negotiating table
when other countries demand low prices subsidized by America's
seniors,'' as HHS Senior Advisor for Drug Pricing Reform John O'Brien
has said?
Answer. If the IPI model were put into effect as proposed, where an
identified average international price would be derived from 16
countries, this would impact our ability to sell our medicines in some
of the identified markets.
The IPI model was issued as an Advanced Notice of Proposed
Rulemaking (ANPRM). Important details such as the medicines that would
be included in the model, the final list of nations included as
reference countries, and the timing of reimbursement changes are still
unknown. We look forward to engaging with policymakers on this
proposal.
Question. What are some of your ideas on how we can ensure
Americans aren't shouldering the full cost of pharmaceuticals?
Answer. We agree that out-of-pocket costs are unsustainable in the
U.S., but the answer is not to move to a system found in other
countries or to link pricing in the U.S. to the International Pricing
Index.
It is critical to recognize that while price controls are the
default in many other countries, these price controls result in reduced
access to important medicines. In the 16 countries referenced in the
International Pricing Index model proposal, only 55 percent of new
cancer medicines are available, compared to 96 percent in the U.S. In
those countries, it also takes more than a year longer for the
medicines to become available and this can have significant impacts on
patients. For example, in 2018, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) approved a new indication for
LYNPARZA for ovarian cancer. However, the U.K.'s National Institute for
Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has not recommended that the U.K.'s
National Health System (NHS) reimburse for LYNPARZA in this indication,
resulting in limited access for patients in the U.K.
Instead of international reference pricing, we should focus on
market-based solutions. We believe that there are several steps that
lawmakers can take to ensure that drug prices are affordable for
Americans, while ensuring that innovation in the biopharmaceutical
sector can continue to flourish in the U.S. Our suggestions fall in
five main categories, described in more detail below:

Rebate Reform: The current pharmacy benefit manager (PBM)
rebate system does not fully benefit patients and has resulted
in a lack of transparency across the supply chain. We support
the current proposed rule to eliminate rebates in Medicare Part
D and Medicaid managed care. We also support efforts to
eliminate rebates in the commercial sector as well, which will
likely require legislation. We therefore recommend that
Congress explore legislation that would eliminate rebates in
the commercial market.

Value-Based Agreements: As described in detail in our
written testimony to the Senate Committee on Finance hearing,
we are also working closely with payers and health systems to
explore innovative solutions to improve access and
affordability that demonstrate the value our medicines bring to
patients and the health-care system. For several years,
AstraZeneca has been exploring these types of solutions through
value-based agreements where we are willing to work with
health-care stakeholders to tie payment to patient outcomes. To
date, we have entered into approximately 40 value-based
agreements across our therapeutic areas with a variety of
payers, making AstraZeneca a leader in the field of value-based
agreements.
We believe that there are steps the government can take to
address certain regulatory challenges to the broader
implementation of value-based agreements and help encourage the
timely adoption of value-based agreements, including in public-
sector programs like Medicare. To that end, AstraZeneca
appreciates the support of Senators Warner and Cassidy for
value-based agreements, as demonstrated by their requests for
input on the Patient Affordability Value and Efficiency (PAVE)
Act. This draft legislation would promote the development of
value-based agreements by offering increased flexibility for
manufacturers to enter into such arrangements, including with
Medicare Part D plans.

Biosimilars: We also encourage Congress to consider policies
to encourage greater use of biosimilars in the U.S. We believe
that competition is a key component to reducing costs, and that
is why we support expanded use of biosimilars in the U.S. As a
global company, we operate in countries, particularly those in
the European Union, where biosimilar competition is
particularly robust. We support a similarly vigorous
biosimilars market in the U.S.
We therefore appreciate the efforts of the FDA to increase
the availability of biosimilars in the U.S., including the
FDA's development of a Biosimilars Action Plan. We support
efforts to streamline and improve the efficiency of the
biosimilars approval pathway for the benefit of patients. Such
efforts could include increased transparency into the patents
applicable to biologic medicines.
We also support cost-sharing and reimbursement policies that
facilitate the uptake of biosimilars. Such policies include
Medicare reimbursement rates that ensure that biosimilars can
compete on equal footing with innovator medicines, and
reductions to cost-sharing amounts for biosimilars.

Out-of-Pocket Caps for Medicare Patients: In the commercial
market, it is common for patients to have a cap on total out-
of-pocket amounts. However, such a construct does not exist in
the Medicare program. Because of the way the Part D benefit is
designed, for example, cost-sharing can be particularly high in
the first months of the plan year and/or in the first months of
therapy. A recent study found that rates of prescription
abandonment and delayed initiation of oral cancer therapies
increase as cost-sharing amounts rise. Such a result reflects
the need for a restructuring of the current benefit design,
which could be accomplished by establishing a monthly or annual
out-of-pocket cap. This would give patients greater certainty
in the total amount of out-of-pocket costs they could face.

Transparency: We support greater transparency across the
biopharmaceutical supply chain, which includes greater
transparency into drug pricing. To that end, we generally
support the policies included in the current versions of the
SPIKE and C-THRU Acts. There are a variety of State-level drug
pricing transparency laws and regulations. We believe that
having a consistent, Federal standard for drug pricing
transparency requirements, like those included in the SPIKE
Act, should pre-empt state transparency laws to reduce
confusion and compliance burden.
We also support transparency efforts to ensure that patients
and prescribers have meaningful information on out-of-pocket
costs at the point of prescribing, so that they can make
informed decisions about the most appropriate and affordable
therapy.
foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
Question. President Trump and Secretary Azar have both repeatedly
described their frustrations with ``foreign freeloading'' of U.S. drugs
in the last year. ``When foreign governments extort unreasonably low
prices from U.S. drug makers, Americans have to pay more to subsidize
the enormous cost of research and development. . . . It's unfair and
it's ridiculous, and it's not going to happen any longer.''
Do you agree that because of foreign countries' pricing and
reimbursement systems, U.S. patients and innovators are shouldering the
burden for financing edical advances?
Answer. We agree that many foreign countries' pricing and
reimbursement systems do not adequately recognize innovation in the
biopharmaceutical sector. In many other countries, the government
utilizes price controls for drug therapies, and in many cases these
price controls result in reduced or delayed access to therapy for
patients in those countries. The U.S. benefits from an open-market
system that supports competition and innovation and accordingly
Americans place high value on both choice and access to the latest
medicines. For patients in the U.S., it is not a question of when an
important treatment will be available, but rather how they will access
that medicine. It is in this context that AstraZeneca continues to
engage with other stakeholders regarding possible solutions and
specific actions that can be taken to address pricing concerns, which
we describe in greater detail in our written testimony. These
approaches must balance the need to improve access and affordability
while fostering innovation. Pricing controls as well as access and
reimbursement practices in other countries are a challenge.
Question. How do foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
systems affect our prescription drug costs?
Answer. We do not take into account foreign market pricing in
setting U.S. prices.
Question. Are foreign governments taking note of the concerns being
raised by the Trump administration and have they responded in any way?
Answer. While these matters have been widely reported on globally,
we do not have insights into actions being taken by other health
authorities directly in response to the Trump administration's efforts
in this area.
Question. Has there been any noticeable change in any of our trade
agreements since these concerns have been raised by the Trump
administration?
Answer. AstraZeneca and the biopharmaceutical industry have
consistently advocated for trade agreements that support strong
intellectual property rights and protect market access. We believe our
trade partners should be fair and transparent so that patients around
the world can benefit from U.S. innovation.
medicaid closed formulary proposals
Question. In an attempt to bring down drug costs, various States
have been exploring whether to exclude certain drugs from its Medicaid
program. For example, the State of Massachusetts recently asked CMS for
permission to create a closed formulary where the State Medicaid
program would pick at least one drug per therapeutic class. CMS denied
their waiver request citing violation of Federal law, but this proposal
does bring up important questions on how to contain drug prices in
State Medicaid programs.
If the principles of the Medicare Part D program--including the
necessary patient protections--were applied to State Medicaid programs,
do you think it [would] lower drugs costs while ensuring access to
patients?
Answer. Under the current construct in Medicaid, manufacturers
provide mandatory rebates and in turn, States are required to cover all
of the manufacturer's drugs. This ensures that Medicaid patients have
access to the full range of available therapies. We support increased
flexibility for State Medicaid agencies in managing their Medicaid
programs, but only so long as there are robust protections that ensure
that Medicaid patients can continue to access the medicines they need.
medicaid ``best price''
Question. In the Trump administration's Blueprint, they suggested
that because drug manufactures have to give Medicaid the ``best price''
on drugs, there is no incentive to offer deeper discounts to other
payers--both government and commercial--than what is already offered
under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Does the Medicaid ``best price'' requirement encourage
manufacturers to increase initial prices?
Answer. We do not believe that the Medicaid Best Price requirement
encourages manufacturers to increase their initial list price. However,
the requirement does impact decisions regarding the size of rebates and
discounts offered in the commercial sector because setting a new Best
Price can result in significantly increased Medicaid rebate and 340B
liability. Additionally, manufacturers may be hesitant to offer very
aggressive value-based agreements due to the risk of setting a new Best
Price.
Question. What, if any, changes would you suggest we make to the
program?
Answer. We recommend an exemption from Best Price for value-based
agreements, which is a policy included in Senator Grassley's and
Senator Warner's draft version of the PAVE Act.
outcomes-based contracts
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you highlight your
support of outcomes-based contracts and how we need to be shifting our
system toward that approach.
How will these contracts lower drug costs for patients in both the
near term and long-term?
Answer. While most value-based agreements have been focused on
securing patient access to our medicines and delivering better patient
outcomes, where payers are willing, AstraZeneca is also looking to more
directly address patient out-of-
pocket affordability through these innovative arrangements.
As an example, we recently announced the initiation of a value-
based agreement for University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)
Medicare patients who are prescribed BRILINTA. This value-based
contract, which was effective as of January 1, 2019, is groundbreaking
in two ways. First, the contract lowers the out-of-pocket costs for a
UPMC Medicare Part D patient to approximately $10 for a 30-day supply.
Second, what UPMC pays for BRILINTA will vary based on patient
outcomes, tying the cost of the medicine to its real-world clinical
performance.
We are currently exploring another value-based agreement in
Medicare Part D. In addition to having a significant outcomes-based
component, this arrangement would reduce patient out-of-pocket costs.
This type of agreement allows patients to access their medicines at a
lower out-of-pocket cost and payers to control their overall healthcare
costs through paying for outcomes.
Question. How will they lower overall health-care costs for our
Federal programs?
Answer. We believe medicines are part of the solution to
controlling health-care costs. They not only improve patient outcomes
and increase quality of life, but also reduce downstream costs. Value-
based agreements have the potential to increase efficiencies in the
health-care system, including government programs, by ensuring that
payment is based on value rather than reimbursement based on volume.
These agreements support patients receiving the most appropriate
treatment, ensure appropriate patient behaviors and, most importantly,
tie reimbursement to improved patient outcomes.
In many cases value-based agreements encourage a focus on important
patient behaviors such as adherence and persistence as well as improved
emphasis on patient education to promote healthier lifestyles and
choices. These agreements broaden payer focus to the total cost of care
and quality outcomes. It is important that we look at all aspects
related to the cost of care to find efficiencies that drive greater
value in the health-care system. These opportunities exist in both the
commercial and government sectors.
We support value-based agreements because they allow us to
reimburse the health-care system if our medicines do not deliver as
intended. This solution demonstrates our willingness to stand behind
the value of our medicines.
Through the partnership of payers and policymakers, we look forward
to a future where implementation of value-based agreements across
public and private payers is widespread.
Question. What have the preliminary results looked like so far?
Answer. We are frequently asked if we have ever had to ``pay out''
on a value-based agreement, and the answer is ``yes.'' For example, we
have entered into an agreement for one of our oncology medicines with a
large payer. We have reimbursed the payer for more than 20 percent of
patients on that medicine. Of course, we also have examples where we
have seen the medicine perform as well or better than our clinical
data. This is good for patients and good for the payer and health
system overall in that, by providing access to that medicine, they have
seen improved patient outcomes.
transparency/point of sale
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you express your
support for the Trump administration's proposal to allow manufacturers
to provide PBMs up-front discounts that are passed onto patients at the
point of sale.
Do you feel like this proposal will make the transactions within
the drug supply chain more transparent?
Answer. Yes, the Trump administration's rebate proposal should make
transactions more transparent because cost-sharing will reflect point-
of-sale discounts and, therefore, net prices. We encourage the
administration and Congress to closely assess the impact of such
increased transparency on patients and the biopharmaceutical supply
chain more broadly.
Question. If so, would this transparency bring down drug costs--
overall and for specialty drugs?
Answer. In general, we believe that increased transparency due to
point-of-sale discounts will in turn lead to greater competition and
reduced costs overall. However, the impact of transparency on the
prices of specific drugs will vary based on the competitive landscape
for that medicine.
the relationship between wholesalers and manufacturers
Question. When talking about the pharmaceutical supply chain, a lot
of focus has been placed on the pharmacy benefit manager. But there's
another side of the equation that I'd like to ask about. How do
wholesalers negotiate pricing with manufacturers?
Answer. In general, wholesalers do not negotiate pricing with
manufacturers. Wholesalers receive service fees from manufacturers for
bona fide services they provide.
Question. What impact does this have on drug costs?
Answer. In general, wholesalers do not negotiate pricing with
manufacturers.
Question. What incentives or disincentives do they have to contain
price increases?
Answer. Wholesalers receive service fees from manufacturers for
bona fide services they provide. Certain fees across the supply chain--
including with wholesalers--are based on a percentage of the list
price. We support efforts to ``de-link'' such fees from the list price
across the supply chain, as this would align incentives across the
supply chain to lower prices.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
proposed rebate rule
Question. As has been done in many other settings, drug
manufacturers said during the hearing that one reason list prices for
drugs are high is that pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) demand
larger and larger rebates in order for the drug to receive favorable
placement on a formulary. You and your colleagues who testified during
the hearing stated if the administration's proposal on changes to the
anti-kickback safe harbor for pharmaceutical rebates took effect, your
company would likely lower list price. Like many Oregonians, I am
skeptical drug manufacturers would voluntarily lower their prices.
Therefore, would you support legislation that would (1) make
similar changes the administration has put forward related to Part D
and Medicaid managed care, (2) change the rebate system in a similar
way to the proposal for the commercial market, and (3) require drug
makers to lower the list price of their drugs equal to the amount of
rebates provided today?
Answer. Assuming the HHS rebate rule is finalized largely as
proposed, AstraZeneca intends to comply with its requirements and use
point-of-sale discounts. Our goal is to maintain net prices broadly in
line with today, recognizing our ability to do so may be dependent on
external factors and market response such as how plans evolve their
benefit design and the total degree of transparency under the new
model.
AstraZeneca would plan to reduce list prices, pending reforms
across all payers, including in the commercial sector in addition to
Part D, as the current construct does not allow for two separate list
prices (i.e., one list price for Part D and a different list price for
the commercial sector). Therefore, we also support efforts to eliminate
rebates in the commercial sector and recommend that Congress explore
such legislation. While eliminating rebates is an important step,
benefit designs must also be evaluated.
medicaid drug rebate program
Question. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) requires
manufacturers to provide a basic rebate and an additional inflationary
rebate for both brand and generic drugs. The inflationary rebate is an
increasingly substantial part of total rebates due in large part to
large increases in drug prices that exceed inflation. Under current
law, this inflationary rebate is capped at 100 percent of Average
Manufacturer Price (AMP). This is the case even when manufacturers
continue to raise their prices well above inflation.
Please provide a list of all of your pharmaceutical products that
have reached the Medicaid AMP rebate cap in any of the 20 quarters from
January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018.
Answer. Please see Appendix B.
Question. For each drug listed in response to question 1, please
also provide a list of which quarters and years each drug hit the cap.
Answer. Please see Appendix B.
medicaid drug rebate program compliance
Question. I am concerned about recent reports and legal settlements
surrounding drug manufacturers' failure to comply fully with the
requirements of the MDRP. For example, an analysis by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General
found that between 2012 and 2016 taxpayers may have overpaid by as much
as $1.3 billion for 10 potentially misclassified drugs. That is why I
introduced the Right Rebate Act with Chairman Grassley to prevent drug
manufacturers from manipulating Medicaid to increase their profits.
However, I continued to be concerned about oversight and manufacturer
compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Accordingly, please describe the following:
Your company's current compliance plan and procedures used to
ensure compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program including internal audits or other checks you use to identify
compliance vulnerabilities.
Answer. All aspects of AstraZeneca's compliance with the
requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including Statutory
Pricing (average manufacturer price (AMP) and Best Price) and Medicaid
Rebate payments, are covered by AstraZeneca's compliance framework.
This compliance plan includes a robust review process, including
Sarbanes-Oxley testing, self-auditing, and formal audits by internal
and external audit.
Question. Any past or ongoing issues of non-compliance.
Answer. Since the implementation of AstraZeneca's compliance
framework, we are not aware of any compliance issues that have been
identified via this internal and external audit process.
Question. Any corrective actions taken to address identified
problems or issues of non-compliance with the MDRP and how such steps
were communicated to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Answer. As noted above, to date, no compliance issues have been
identified via this internal and external audit process.
Question. Any steps taken to improve compliance and ensure that all
Medicaid drug rebates owed to the Federal Government and the States are
paid in full.
Answer. AstraZeneca has a comprehensive compliance framework that
includes Sarbanes-Oxley testing, self-auditing, and formal audits by
internal and external audit. Additionally, as it relates to Medicaid
drug rebates owed to the Federal Government and States, AstraZeneca
performs additional reviews of claims-level data, ensuring the
completeness and accuracy of both the payments made by manufacturers as
well as claims submitted to manufacturers. This process has identified
duplicate pharmacy claims submitted to State Medicaid Agencies
resulting in overpayment by both States and manufacturers. Clearly,
these overpayments disadvantage both the States and manufacturers like
AstraZeneca.
bonus payments tied to specific drugs
Question. I am concerned by the potential for employee financial
incentives to encourage high launch prices and price increases for
prescription drugs.
Is your salary, bonus, or other compensation tied to sales or
revenue targets of a single product your company sells? Has it ever
been? If yes, please state the product or products to which your
salary, bonus or other compensation was tied.
Answer. The CEO's compensation as well as the compensation of other
senior leaders is directly based on three areas of performance that are
generally weighted equally: development and delivery of innovative
science, our aggregate sales, and other important financial metrics.
AstraZeneca understands that executive pay is a closely scrutinized
issue. As part of our compensation decisions, we are mindful of the
sensitivity of this issue as we determine how best to incentivize,
reward and retain executives capable of leading a global pharmaceutical
company in a highly competitive market.
Question. Is your salary, bonus, or other compensation tied to
either revenue or net income of the company as a whole? Has it ever
been? If yes, please explain what assumptions about price increases are
used when the compensation committee sets revenue or net income goals.
Does the compensation committee provide any guidance to executives in
regards to the amount of revenue that the company will generate from
price increases versus volume growth?
Answer. The CEO's compensation as well as the compensation of other
senior leaders is directly based on three areas of performance that are
generally weighted equally: development and delivery of innovative
science, our aggregate sales, and other important financial metrics.
AstraZeneca's Remuneration Committee does not provide any guidance on
price increases.
provision of rebates in exchange for formulary placement
Question. In today's system, drug makers receive a limited time
window to sell their drug without competition. After that period has
expired, low-cost generics should become available. However, drug
makers often prevent access to these cheaper generic drugs in Medicare.
Researchers have found that 72 percent of Medicare Part D plans charged
lower cost-sharing for a brand name drug compared to its generic
equivalent. This means seniors were charged less out of pocket for
brand name drugs compared to generics that are on average four times
cheaper than the brand-named drug. This happens because drug makers pay
a rebate to the Part D plans in order to give the more expensive drug
better treatment than a generic. As a result, Medicare spending
increases due to the current structure of the Part D benefit.
Has your company ever paid a rebate to a Part D plan so that a
brand name drug would get preferential treatment (i.e., lower cost-
sharing or less utilization management) compared to a cheaper generic?
Answer. In certain instances, AstraZeneca enters into arrangements
under which a branded agent is discounted at or below the net cost of
the generic(s) in the market, therefore benefiting the plan and the
beneficiary. AstraZeneca typically enters into these types of
arrangements for medicines already existing on formulary. These
arrangements benefit patients by ensuring greater affordability for the
branded medicine and by ensuring continuity of treatment if a patient
has already been prescribed a branded medicine. These arrangements also
support competition because they provide the opportunity for multiple
competitors and medicine options to compete on price and other factors.
We have had several such arrangements in Medicare Part D (see Appendix
C).
Question. If so, please provide:
A list of the drugs for which your company has done this since
January 1, 2014.
Answer. A list providing this information is attached as Appendix
C.
Question. The number of Part D plans in which this type of rebate
was given for each drug in each year.
Answer. A list of the relevant Part D plans is included in Appendix
C.
net prices
Question. During your testimony, you stated, ``The estimates for
2018 show that across our medicines, our average rebate is nearly 50
percent of our gross revenues in the U.S. Despite this, in recent
years, in our primary cap portfolio, we have seen flat to declining net
effective prices for most of our medicines.''
Please describe how the company's year-over-year aggregate net
price is calculated.
Answer. The analysis discussed during the hearing on February 26,
2019 was completed by brand; the change in Net Price was calculated at
the brand level, and then weighted based on Net Sales for each brand as
a percent of Total Net Product Sales for 2018.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ Net Product Sales reflect the invoiced amount less movements in
estimated accruals for rebates and chargebacks given to managed-care
and other customers. Cash discounts for prompt payment are also
deducted from sales. Average Net Price per Unit excludes product
returns, and the figures were arrived at using the conventional Net
Price calculation, that is, before deducting cost of goods sold,
royalties, and variable selling expenses.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question. Please also specifically address the following questions:
How many products are included in the calculation of the average
net price change? What was the median net price change?
Answer. The analysis discussed during the hearing on February 26,
2019 included 26 brands that represent 98 percent of annual Net Product
Sales in the United States for the period ending December 31, 2018.
The Median Price Change (prior to weighting) was a Net Price
decrease of 1 percent.
Question. Is net price weighted? If so, how? For example, in
determining the aggregate net price does the company assign different
weights to different products based on volume or other factors? Are
``on patent'' and ``off patent'' drugs weighted identically? Are other
statistical weights used or are all products treated equally?
Answer. The analysis discussed during the hearing on February 26,
2019 was completed by brand; the change in Net Price was calculated at
the brand level, and then weighted based on Net Sales for each brand as
a percent of Total Net Product Sales for 2018 irrespective of whether
the medicines are on or off patent.
Question. Does the figure that you provided during your testimony
account for U.S. prices, international prices, or both? Generally
speaking, when your company reports net price changes, does it
differentiate between U.S. and international prices?
Answer. The analysis discussed during the hearing on February 26,
2019 referred to 26 brands that represent 98 percent of annual Net
Product Sales in the United States for the period ending December 31,
2018.
Question. Please list the five drugs your company sold in the U.S.
that had the greatest year-over-year net price increase in 2018, noting
the increase for each drug by dollar figure and percentage. Please list
the five drugs your company sold in the U.S. that had the lowest year-
over-year net price increase (and/or the greatest decrease) in 2018,
noting the increase (or decrease) for each drug by dollar figure and
percentage.
Answer. In 2018, we experienced a Weighted Average Net price
decline in our hyper-competitive respiratory and diabetes therapeutic
areas, with declines of 2.4 percent and 1.9 percent, respectively. Our
Weighted Average Net prices in oncology remained flat. Brand-specific
pricing information is competitively sensitive information.
Question. For 2018, what was the average net price change in the
U.S. market for (1) drugs with no competition, (2) drugs with only
branded competition, and (3) drugs with generic competition?
Answer. For 2018, the Weighted Average Net price change in the
United States market for:

Medicines with no competition was an increase of 0.6
percent;

Branded ``on patent'' medicines without generic equivalents
was a decrease of 4.7 percent;

``Off patent'' medicines with generic equivalent competition
was an increase of 4.6 percent.
With respect to the last category of medicines described above, we
note by way of context that once generic options enter the market, our
market share rapidly erodes, as many PBMs, insurers, and government
agencies to which AstraZeneca offers rebates and discounts replace our
branded medicines on their formularies with these generic competitors.
Accordingly, the mix of business for medicines with generic competition
shifts towards programs whereby health plans/PBMs chose to list our
branded medicines on their formularies given a lower net cost versus
generics, and to individual patients who chose to pay for branded
agents over generic agents, resulting in a higher average net effective
price across all distribution channels.
Question. You state that ``the estimates for 2018 show that across
our medicines, our average rebate is nearly 50 percent of our gross
revenues in the U.S.'' For each product, please disclose the gross
revenue and the amount of rebates paid.
Answer. The table below reflects our Product Sales in the U.S. for
the period ending December 31, 2018, including the proportion of Gross
Sales allocated to estimated amounts we expect to pay to third-party
managed care organizations, hospitals, long-term care facilities, group
purchasing organizations, and various Federal or State programs. The
percentage of Gross Product Sales column reflects our effective rebate
rate per channel, a combination of mix of business in that channel and
related rebate rate.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez
Question. During the hearing, when I asked whether your company
engaged in tactics to delay generic production of your products, you
answered ``no.'' However, AstraZeneca appears on the FDA's list of
companies who have access complaints against them.
Can you explain the discrepancy between your answer and the FDA
list? The FDA list can be found here: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/
DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/
ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrug
ApplicationANDAGenerics/ucm607738.htm.
Answer. AstraZeneca appreciates the opportunity to address the
question of one of our medicines (BRILINTA) appearing on the Reference
Listed Drug Access Inquiries list (RLD List). We would first like to
state that AstraZeneca supports allowing generic manufacturers access
to samples. Withholding or otherwise blocking such access is
inconsistent with that position. Our internal review has not identified
any unanswered, delayed, or outstanding requests for samples of
BRILINTA (ticagrelor) by any generic manufacturers.
It is our understanding that BRILINTA was included on the RLD List
based on a single inquiry received by the FDA. Unfortunately, the RLD
List does not identify the company that reportedly requested
information (or samples) from AstraZeneca, the date the information was
requested, or any other information that would allow AstraZeneca to
better understand or further investigate the circumstances of this
inquiry. On its website, the FDA does advise that it has ``not
independently investigated or confirmed the access limitations
described in the inquiries received.'' Given this limitation, the
listing of an inquiry on the RLD List does not mean that the FDA has in
fact determined that access to samples by generic manufacturers was
limited or withheld for the medicines identified. Indeed, based on our
internal review, we have not identified any circumstances that
substantiate the inquiry received by the FDA relating to BRILINTA.
BRILINTA is and has always been available via normal commercial
distribution channels (i.e., wholesalers) since its U.S. launch. It has
never had a restricted distribution program.
Finally, more than 15 generic manufacturers have applied for
regulatory approval from the FDA for the manufacture of generic
ticagrelor and some, like Watson/Teva, have received tentative
approvals from the FDA. Because conducting bioequivalence studies with
the branded medicine is an FDA preapproval requirement, it is clear
that these generic manufacturers are not having difficulty accessing
branded ticagrelor for their studies.
In light of the context provided above, it is unclear why any
generic manufacturer would be unable to obtain a sample of BRILINTA for
their purposes or why an inquiry was lodged with the FDA related to
this medicine.
Question. When new products enter the market, do drug companies set
high initial rebates and then provide deep rebates in order to gain
access to insurance plan's formularies?
Answer. No, this is not AstraZeneca's general practice. We
negotiate rebates and discounts with payers and pharmacy benefit
managers (PBMs)--including in Medicare Part D--to help ensure that
patients have the most robust access possible to our therapies. Without
these discounts and rebates, many lifesaving medicines would not be
placed on plan formularies and therefore would be largely unavailable
to the patients who need them most.
The current rebate system creates misaligned incentives. This
results in a growing differential between list and net prices. We
support reforms of this system that include the elimination of rebates
in the commercial sector and in Medicare Part D, which will result in
the reduction of the differential between list and net prices and which
would allow manufacturers to ensure that the initial list price of a
drug reflects its net value.
Question. If CMS finalizes the rebate rule, do you anticipate
future products entering the market with significantly lower initial
list prices?
Answer. We believe that eliminating rebates across Medicare Part D
and commercial will generally result in lower initial list prices than
in the absence of reform, although the impact on specific medicines
will vary based on the competitive dynamics for that medicine. Reform
only in Part D and not commercial is unlikely to impact initial list
price setting practices, as the current structure does not allow for
two separate list prices (i.e., one list price for Part D and a
different list price for the commercial sector).
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Thomas R. Carper
Question. What are your recommendations for lowering prices for the
40 percent of drugs that do not offer rebates in Medicare Part D? In
the health insurance plans that you offer your employees, do you ask
your insurers to pass through the full manufacturer rebates to the
beneficiaries?
Answer. All of our medicines are rebated under the statutory
requirements of Medicaid, Federal Supply Schedule, 340B, and the Part D
coverage gap discount program. For our highly innovative, targeted
therapies, we do not typically provide additional rebates other than
through our value-based agreements, where such discounts are based on
patient outcomes.
In general, medicines with minimal rebates are the newest and most
innovative on the market. Expanded use of value-based agreements is a
key component to lowering costs and improving access to these medicines
that are currently not in highly rebated therapeutic classes. Under
such arrangements, manufacturers may contract to reimburse plans if the
medicine does not work as expected, lowering risks for the payer. This
also results in competition across manufacturers of medicines in these
classes by facilitating competition across clinical results and
outcomes.
As we stated before the Senate Committee on Finance, AstraZeneca
has put forward several proposals in addition to value-based agreements
to address drug pricing:

Moving away from the current rebate system, while continuing
to work with payers and PBMs to ensure robust negotiations;

Using a portion of discounts and rebates to create out-of-
pocket caps for Medicare patients;

Encouraging biosimilars and eliminating policy and
commercial barriers to their greater use.
AstraZeneca also supports increased transparency across the
biopharmaceutical supply chain, including transparency with respect to
drug pricing. To that end, we generally support the policies included
in the current versions of the SPIKE and C-THRU Acts. There are a
variety of state-level drug pricing transparency laws and regulations.
We believe that having a consistent, federal standard for drug pricing
transparency requirements, like those included in the SPIKE Act, should
pre-empt state level laws to reduce confusion and compliance burden.
We also support transparency efforts to ensure that patients and
prescribers have meaningful information on out-of-pocket costs at the
point of prescribing, so that they can make informed decisions about
the most appropriate and affordable therapy.
AstraZeneca wants to be a constructive partner in identifying
solutions that continue to allow manufacturers to innovate while
creating a more efficient and more affordable system.
AstraZeneca provides generous health-care benefits to its
employees. Today, we provide a point-of-sale discount on prescription
medicines in the form of low out-of-pocket costs for our employees. We
cap our employees' out-of-pocket costs on prescription medicines at $50
per fill to ensure they do not forgo their prescriptions due to high
out-of-pocket costs.
Question. The systems for pricing and distributing drugs are opaque
and difficult to understand.
What are your recommendations for increasing transparency in how
your companies set the list prices for drugs, and for improving
transparency in the supply chain for prescription drugs? Would you
support Federal standards for transparency in setting the list prices
for drugs?
Answer. We do believe that greater transparency is needed for
manufacturers as well as other entities in the supply chain. We
therefore would generally support transparency requirements such as
those included in the SPIKE and C-THRU Acts. Any transparency
requirements should consider the need to protect competitively
sensitive information to ensure robust competition in the market.
There are a variety of State-level drug pricing transparency laws
and regulations. We believe that having a consistent, Federal standard
for drug pricing transparency requirements, like those included in the
SPIKE Act, should pre-empt State-level laws to reduce confusion and
compliance burden.
Question. In nearly every sector of the health-care industry,
Medicare, Medicaid, employers, and insurers are moving away from fee-
for-service payments to reimbursements based on value and performance.
Prescription drugs and medical devices were the glaring exceptions to
this trend until recently.
How many of your drugs are included in value-based contracts and
how many patients are benefiting from them? How do these value-based
contracts work to lower drug prices for both patients and taxpayers?
Answer. We believe medicines are part of the solution to
controlling health-care costs. They not only improve patient outcomes
and increase quality of life, but also reduce downstream costs. Value-
based agreements allow us to reimburse the health-care system if our
medicines do not deliver as intended. This solution demonstrates our
willingness to stand behind the value of our medicines.
AstraZeneca is working closely with payers and health systems to
explore innovative solutions to improve access and affordability that
demonstrate the value our medicines bring to patients and the health-
care system. Our value-based agreements aim to manage the totality of
treatment costs and keep people healthy and out of the hospital. For
several years, AstraZeneca has been exploring these types of solutions
through value-based agreements where we are willing to work with
health-care stakeholders to tie payment to patient outcomes.
To date, we have entered into approximately 40 value-based
agreements for 15 medicines across our therapeutic areas with a variety
of payers, making AstraZeneca a leader in the field of value-based
agreements. Tens of thousands of patients have benefited from improved
access as part of these agreements.
As an example, and as noted in our written testimony submitted to
the Senate Committee on Finance, AstraZeneca agreed with Express
Scripts that for IRESSA, an oral treatment for certain types of lung
cancer, we will fully reimburse Express Scripts for discontinued use
before the third fill, including if discontinuation occurs because
patients did not respond to treatment.
While most of these agreements have been focused on securing
patient access to our medicines and delivering better patient outcomes,
where payers are willing, we are also looking to more directly address
patient out-ofpocket affordability through these innovative
arrangements.
As an example, we recently announced the initiation of a value-
based agreement for University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)
Medicare patients who are prescribed BRILINTA. This value-based
contract, which was effective as of January 1, 2019, is groundbreaking
in two ways. First, the contract lowers the out-of-pocket costs for a
UPMC Medicare Part D patient to approximately $10 for a 30-day supply.
Second, what UPMC pays for BRILINTA will vary based on patient
outcomes, tying the cost of the medicine to its real-world clinical
performance.
We are currently exploring another value-based agreement in
Medicare Part D. In addition to having a significant outcomes-based
component, this arrangement would reduce patient out-of-pocket costs.
This type of agreement allows patients to access their medicines at a
lower out-of-pocket cost and payers to control their overall health-
care costs through paying for outcomes.
Question. Last year, Senator Portman and I did an investigation on
the pricing of an opioid overdose reversal drug called EVZIO,
manufactured by Kaleo. Kaleo increased the price of EVZIO from $575 in
2014 to $4,100 in 2017. We found that the best price Medicare was able
to get for EVZIO, about $4,000, was much higher than the price other
federal programs and private insurers were able to get. It seemed that
Kaleo was able to get this higher price of $4,000 from Medicare by
helping doctors fill out paperwork showing that the drug was medically
necessary, even though there are cheaper alternatives on the market. As
a result of the investigation, Kaleo announced it will bring a generic
version of the drug to market at only $168 per pack.
Are any of your companies providing medical necessity paperwork to
doctors in order to get your drugs covered by Medicare?
Answer. AstraZeneca policies prohibit completing medical necessity
paperwork for doctors or their staff as described in your inquiry.
Question. In 2017, the Rand Corporation estimated that biosimilar
drugs, which are competitors to complex, biologic drugs, could save the
United States more than $50 billion over the next decade. Some of you
have also argued that increasing the use of biosimilar drugs would help
lower drugs costs for consumers and taxpayers.
What is delaying the uptake of biosimilar drugs in the United
States? What policies do you recommend to increase the development of
biosimilar drugs?
Answer. AstraZeneca believes that competition is a key component to
reducing costs, and that is why we support the expanded use of
biosimilars in the U.S. As a global company, we operate in countries,
particularly those in the European Union, where biosimilar competition
is particularly robust. We support a similarly vigorous biosimilars
market in the U.S.
There are several challenges to biosimilar uptake in the U.S.,
including contracting and rebating dynamics and difficulty in obtaining
interchangeability status. We therefore appreciate the efforts of the
FDA to increase the availability of biosimilars in the U.S., including
the FDA's development of a Biosimilars Action Plan. We support efforts
to streamline and improve the efficiency of the biosimilars approval
pathway for the benefit of patients. Such efforts could include
increased transparency into the patents applicable to biologic
medicines.
We also support reimbursement policies that facilitate the uptake
of biosimilars. Such policies include Medicare reimbursement rates that
ensure that biosimilars can compete on equal footing with innovator
medicines, and reductions to cost-sharing amounts for biosimilars. We
also believe the elimination of rebates will help biosimilars compete
with innovator medicines.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
Question. The United States is one of the only countries in the
world to allow prescription drug manufacturers to advertise directly to
consumers through magazines, billboards, radio, and television
commercials. While I will not argue that it is beneficial to educate
consumers about an unfamiliar disease and encourage them to seek
medical help, most commercials from all of your companies recommend
asking about a specific brand name drug, not a medical condition.
Furthermore, even if your advertisements follow all FDA rules and list
medication side effects, they also almost always list these while a
smiling, apparently healthy person is walking on a beach. Researchers
say that this type of imagery, combined with viewing hours of drug
commercials each month, leads consumers to underestimate the risks
associated with medications. For the past decade, studies have shown
that aggressive direct-to-consumer advertising is associated with
rising drug prices and an increase in inappropriate drug prescriptions.
Since researchers have concluded that consumers are
misunderstanding the benefits and risks described in your ads, what
further policies could help you and your colleagues ensure that you are
educating patients in a clear manner?
Answer. Our advertising complies with regulatory requirements
governing direct-toconsumer (DTC) advertising and AstraZeneca believes
that DTC advertising is important to raising brand and disease
awareness, fostering patient education, and enhancing the dialogue
between patients and their physicians. Unfortunately, these positive
impacts of health-care communication efforts are often left out of the
DTC debate.
pharmaceutical companies continue to raise prices
Question. As you are well aware, high prescription drug prices are
the number one concern for Americans and their families. According to
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the average
American spends around $1,208 annually on prescription drugs. There
have been several instances where brand name or even generic drugs that
have been on the market for years continue to increase in price. One of
the most well-known examples is Mylan's increase of the price of EpiPen
from less than $100 in 2007 to more than $600 in 2016. Another example,
is the ever-increasing price of insulin. Sanofi increased the price of
a vial of Lantus from $88.20 in 2007 to $307.20 in 2017. And those are
just a small sample of price increases.
Why don't we see price decreases for drugs that have been on the
market for years without new formulations or added benefit?
Answer. As an initial matter, it is important to note the
distinction between list and net prices. Over the past several years,
discounts and rebates for our therapies have increased overall, both in
the commercial sector and Part D. In recent years, in our primary care
portfolio, which includes the majority of our therapies, we have seen
flat to declining net effective prices to AstraZeneca for most of our
medicines. Flat to declining net prices is a trend across the industry.
However, the current system makes list price decreases challenging.
Therefore, to accomplish meaningful change in terms of lowering
list price, the system must be restructured to eliminate rebates.
Assuming the HHS rebate rule is finalized largely as proposed,
AstraZeneca intends to comply with its requirements and use point-of-
sale discounts. Our goal is to maintain net prices broadly in line with
today, recognizing our ability to do so may be dependent on external
factors and market response such as how plans evolve their benefit
design and the total degree of transparency under the new model.
AstraZeneca would plan to reduce list prices, pending reforms
across all payers, including in the commercial sector in addition to
Part D, as the current construct does not allow for two separate list
prices (i.e., one list price for Part D and a different list price for
the commercial sector). Therefore, we also support efforts to eliminate
rebates in the commercial sector, and recommend that Congress explore
such legislation. While eliminating rebates is an important step,
benefit designs must also be evaluated.
pay for delay
Question. Pay for delay is a tactic that more and more branded drug
manufacturers have been using to stifle competition from lower-cost
generic manufacturers. This allows you to sidestep competition by
offering patent settlements that pay generic companies not to bring
lower-cost alternatives to market. These ``pay-for-delay'' patent
settlements benefit both brand-name pharmaceutical companies by helping
them avoid costly patent litigation and general manufacturers by
rewarding them a hefty sum to delay entering the market with a cheaper
drug alternative. However, these deals do not benefit consumers.
According to an FTC study, these anticompetitive deals cost consumers
and taxpayers $3.5 billion in higher drug costs every year.
Does your company partake in pay-for-delay settlements?
Answer. AstraZeneca does not enter into settlements that pay
generic competitors to delay entry into the market. In the absence of a
settlement, a generic would not necessarily prevail in the patent
litigation and therefore would not be able to enter the market. Indeed,
AstraZeneca has entered into many early-entry patent settlements that
permit generic competitors to enter the market before expiration of
AstraZeneca's patent rights by allowing generic manufacturers to
license innovator patents.
All of AstraZeneca's patent settlements fully comply with the law.
These settlements provide increased clarity and stability to both
parties, allowing innovators like AstraZeneca to continue investing
substantially in new medicines for patients and frequently allowing
generic competitors to enter the market before expiration of
AstraZeneca's patent rights.
Question. Why would a pharmaceutical company enter into a pay-for-
delay agreement?
Answer. AstraZeneca does not enter into agreements that pay generic
competitors to delay entry into the market.
Question. Do you think these agreements stifle competition and
prevent generic alternatives to your branded medications?
Answer. AstraZeneca does not enter into agreements that pay generic
competitors to delay entry into the market. However, AstraZeneca has
entered into many early-entry patent settlements that permit generic
competitors to enter the market before expiration of AstraZeneca's
patent rights by allowing generic manufacturers to license innovator
patents. These do not stifle competition but instead permit early entry
by resolving patent disputes that would otherwise prevent generic
alternatives to branded medication.
value-based pricing
Question. One idea I wanted to get your thoughts on today, is the
idea of value-based pricing. This is an idea where a company could link
the single price it charges for a given drug to an assessment of how
well it works. Some value-based pricing arrangements could allow
insurers and patients to receive rebates from drug manufacturers if a
drug failed to work (outcome-based pricing). Another version would
involve ``indication-based pricing'' in which drug companies charge
different prices for the same drug when it is used to treat different
conditions.
Dr. Soriot, we have heard that AstraZeneca has been participating
in a value-based program in collaboration with the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center.
Could you talk more about your research in value-based pricing and
how you believe this could be possible solution to some of the high
drug prices?
Answer. We believe medicines are part of the solution to
controlling health-care costs. They not only improve patient outcomes
and increase quality of life, but also reduce downstream costs. Value-
based agreements allow us to reimburse the health-care system if our
medicines do not deliver as intended. This solution demonstrates our
willingness to stand behind the value of our medicines.
AstraZeneca is working closely with payers and health systems to
explore innovative solutions to improve access and affordability that
demonstrate the value our medicines bring to patients and the health-
care system. Our value-based agreements aim to manage the totality of
treatment costs and keep people healthy and out of the hospital. For
several years, AstraZeneca has been exploring these types of solutions
through value-based agreements where we are willing to work with
health-care stakeholders to tie payment to patient outcomes.
To date, we have entered into approximately 40 value-based
agreements across our therapeutic areas with a variety of payers.
Our research in value-based agreements has been focused on
addressing the comprehensive value of a medicine in terms of medical
cost offsets and the economic impact of achieving certain health
benefits with a medicine in a specific population. Our experience in
this area consists of health economics and outcomes research (HEOR) and
real-world evidence (RWE) studies which correlate improved outcomes and
overall better health to a direct, positive economic impact, realized
by both the payer and the patient. We use HEOR and RWE data to
establish the metrics of the value-based agreement. Another important
part of our value-based agreement research is how we measure the impact
of a value-based agreement, so we can learn what works and what does
not work for future iterations of value-based agreements.
In addition, by aligning payments for medicines more directly with
their value in improving health outcomes and/or reducing the need for
other healthcare services (such as hospitalizations), value-based
arrangements make pharmaceutical manufacturers accountable for the
results our medicines achieve and can help improve patients' health and
maximize the benefits of healthcare spending. Over time, proliferation
of value-based agreements can shift utilization toward medicines with
greater clinical value and greater ability to reduce hospitalizations
and other costly services, resulting in better health outcomes and
lower overall healthcare spending.
As manufacturers develop more complex, personalized, and promising
treatments--such as gene therapies, cell therapies, or immuno-
therapies--it will be increasingly important for health plans to enter
into value-based agreements so that they and our healthcare system may
recognize the full value of those treatments and make them available to
patients at affordable out-of-pocket amounts. Value-based agreements
serve an important role in linking the price of a medicine to
beneficiaries' demonstrated real world outcomes using that medicine.
While most of these agreements have been focused on securing
patient access to our medicines, some have also helped payers identify
which patient types are most likely to benefit from our medicines and
deliver improved patient outcomes. Partnering to drive this type of
clarity can reduce overall drug spend in meaningful ways. Where payers
are willing, we are also looking to more directly address patient out-
of-pocket affordability through these innovative arrangements.
As you mention, we recently announced the initiation of a value-
based agreement for University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC)
Medicare patients who are prescribed BRILINTA. This value-based
contract, which was effective as of January 1, 2019, is groundbreaking
in two ways. First, the contract lowers the out-of-pocket costs for a
UPMC Medicare Part D patient to approximately $10 for a 30-day supply.
Second, what UPMC pays for BRILINTA will vary based on patient
outcomes, tying the cost of the medicine to its real-world clinical
performance.
Through the partnership of payers and policymakers, we look forward
to a future where implementation of value-based agreements across
public and private payers is widespread. Value-based agreements are one
proactive solution; they are not the only solution.
drug rebate rule
Question. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services'
(HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) promulgated a new regulation to
remove regulatory safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback
Statute (AKS) for rebates on prescription drugs rebates paid by
manufactures to PBMs under Medicare Part D and for Medicaid managed
care organizations (MCOs). The OIG proposal attempts to ban most
rebates by eliminating their regulatory protections. The rule is
predicted to increase net drug costs in its early years. The CMS
actuaries estimate it would cost $196 billion over 10 years. Despite
this high price tag, the beneficiary benefits are limited. The proposed
rule notes that under the CMS Actuary's analysis, the majority of
beneficiaries would see an increase in their total out-of-pocket
payments and premium costs; reductions in total cost sharing will
exceed total premium increases.
I wanted to ask a question about the administration's rebate rule,
which I understand that many of the drug manufacturers, and your main
trade association, strongly support. According to an analysis of the
rule by the Office of Actuaries at CMS, drug manufacturers are likely
to initially retain 15 percent of the current rebates as higher net
drug prices.
Given that estimate, can you provide the committee with any
assurances that prices will not increase under this proposed rule?
Answer. Assuming the HHS rebate rule is finalized largely as
proposed, AstraZeneca intends to comply with its requirements and use
point-of-sale discounts. Our goal is to maintain net prices broadly in
line with today, recognizing our ability to do so may be dependent on
external factors and market response such as how plans evolve their
benefit design and the total degree of transparency under the new
model.
AstraZeneca would plan to reduce list prices, pending reforms
across all payers, including in the commercial sector in addition to
Part D, as the current construct does not allow for two separate list
prices (i.e., one list price for Part D and a different list price for
the commercial sector). Therefore, we also support efforts to eliminate
rebates in the commercial sector, and recommend that Congress explore
such legislation. While eliminating rebates is an important step,
benefit designs must also be evaluated.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
Question. According to an article recently published in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, medical marketers spent nearly $30
billion dollars in 2016, up from $17 billion in 1997. Direct-to-
Consumer (DTC) advertising had the biggest percentage increase: from
$2.1 billion, or 11.9 percent of all medical marketing, in 1997 to $9.6
billion, or 32 percent of total spending, in 2016.
Can you please provide what your ratio of spending on sales and
marketing to research and development is today?
Answer. In 2018, we spent $5.9 billion on RandD and $6.1 billion on
Sales and Marketing, globally. Our Sales and Marketing figures include
all costs incurred in selling, marketing, promoting, and distributing
our products.
price-gouging
Question. Sanofi, as I understand it, has made a pledge to the
public to limit its price increases to the national health expenditures
growth projection.
Would your company commit to a cap on annual price increases as
part of your PhRMA membership criteria?
Answer. Our decisions around pricing would always need to remain
independent of PhRMA membership criteria.
Question. What policies would you propose to help ensure lower
launch prices for new drugs?
Answer. As we stated at the Senate Committee on Finance hearing,
AstraZeneca has put forward a number of proposals to address drug
pricing, including:

Moving away from the current rebate system, while continuing
to work with payers and PBMs to ensure robust negotiations; and

Encouraging biosimilars and eliminating policy and
commercial barriers to their greater use.
As described below, we also support efforts to increase
transparency in the biopharmaceutical supply chain and drug
pricing specifically.
transparency
Question. In many of your testimonies, you mentioned that the
current system of pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) back-end rebates do
not rarely results in a scenario where the PBM passes on savings to
consumers at the point of sale (POS). The administration recently
proposed a rule to eliminate the anti-kickback statute safe harbor
protections for these drug rebates.
Do you agree that greater transparency should be required to
understand how manufacturers and PBMs are negotiating prices and
rebates to ensure that savings are passed down to beneficiaries?
Answer. Yes, AstraZeneca agrees that greater transparency is
needed. We therefore generally support the policies included in the
current versions of the SPIKE and C-THRU Acts.
There are a variety of State-level drug pricing transparency laws
and regulations. We believe that having a consistent, federal standard
for drug pricing transparency requirements, like those included in the
SPIKE Act, should pre-empt state level laws to reduce confusion and
compliance burden.
pbms
Question. An Axios article from March 7, 2019 highlights the fact
that, while ``pharmaceutical companies put a lot of the blame for high
drug prices on pharmacy benefit managers,'' many large pharmaceutical
companies ``rely on PBMs to manage their own health-care benefits.''
In your role as an employer, does your company contract with a
pharmaceutical benefit manager (PBM) to administer the prescription
drug benefits for your employees and negotiate lower drug costs on your
behalf?
Answer. AstraZeneca prescription drug benefits are managed by
Express Scripts.
Question. For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the
prescription drug benefit for your employees, how do you utilize the
rebates your PBM negotiates to lower health-care costs or drug costs
for your employee plans and what does your company do with that
savings? Specifically, do the savings go toward lowing premiums?
Answer. AstraZeneca provides generous healthcare benefits to its
employees. Today, we provide a point-of-sale discount on prescription
medicines in the form of low out-of-pocket costs for our employees. We
cap our employees' out-of-pocket costs on prescription medicines at $50
per fill to ensure they do not forgo their prescriptions due to high
out-ofpocket costs.
Question. For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the
prescription drug benefit for your employees, does your PBM offer
point-of-sale rebates to your employees?
Answer. While AstraZeneca does not currently offer point-of-sale
rebates to employees, we are exploring opportunities to evolve our
benefits in the future.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse
Question. Please describe any policy changes you support that would
result in your company lowering the list prices of its drugs.
Answer. The current rebate construct is the key challenge in
reducing list prices and we would support legislation that would
eliminate rebates in Part D and the commercial sector. Assuming the HHS
rebate rule is finalized largely as proposed, AstraZeneca intends to
comply with its requirements and use point-of-sale discounts. Our goal
is to maintain net prices broadly in line with today, recognizing our
ability to do so may be dependent on external factors and market
response such as how plans evolve their benefit design and the total
degree of transparency under the new model.
AstraZeneca would plan to reduce list prices, pending reforms
across all payers, including in the commercial sector in addition to
Part D, as the current construct does not allow for two separate list
prices (i.e., one list price for Part D and a different list price for
the commercial sector). Therefore, we also support efforts to eliminate
rebates in the commercial sector, and recommend that Congress explore
such legislation. While eliminating rebates is an important step,
benefit designs must also be evaluated.
Question. How much does your company's research and development
portfolio rely on taxpayer-funded research conducted by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH)? How many of your company's products are
based, at least in part, on NIH research, and how many are the result
of research funded solely by your company?
Answer. We collaborate with the National Institutes of Health and
the National Cancer Institute, and these partnerships can lead to
important advances for patients. However, biopharmaceutical companies
conduct the vast majority of R&D needed to bring new medicines to
patients and they bear the associated costs and risks.
Question. In each of the last 5 years, how much has your company
spent on research and development versus the advertising and marketing
of your products?
Answer. Last year alone, we invested nearly $6 billion in R&D,
which represents 28 percent of our total product sales, well above the
industry average.
Our Sales and Marketing figures include all costs incurred in
selling, marketing, promoting, and distributing our products.

Question. During the hearing, you mentioned that your company would
be likely to lower the list prices of its drugs if the recent proposal
by the Trump administration to change the current system of rebates was
extended to the private market.
If the policy was extended to the private market, how large would
the list price reductions be relative to the size of the rebates your
company is currently providing?
Answer. Assuming the HHS rebate rule is finalized largely as
proposed, AstraZeneca intends to comply with its requirements and use
pointof-sale discounts. Our goal is to maintain net prices broadly in
line with today, recognizing our ability to do so may be dependent on
external factors and market response such as how plans evolve their
benefit design and the total degree of transparency under the new
model.
AstraZeneca would plan to reduce list prices, pending reforms
across all payers, including in the commercial sector in addition to
Part D, as the current construct does not allow for two separate list
prices (i.e., one list price for Part D and a different list price for
the commercial sector). Therefore, we also support efforts to eliminate
rebates in the commercial sector, and recommend that Congress explore
such legislation. While eliminating rebates is an important step,
benefit designs must also be evaluated.
Question. How will this proposal affect how your company sets the
list prices for new drug products?
Answer. We believe that eliminating rebates across Medicare Part D
and commercial will generally result in lower initial list prices than
in the absence of reform, although the impact on specific medicines
will vary based on the competitive dynamics for that medicine. Reform
only in Part D and not commercial is unlikely to impact initial list
price setting practices, as the current structure does not allow for
two separate list prices (i.e., one list price for Part D and a
different list price for the commercial sector).
Question. If the proposal is finalized and not extended to the
private market, will your company make any list price reductions? If
so, how large would the reductions be relative to the size of the
rebates your company is currently providing?
Answer. AstraZeneca would plan to reduce list prices, pending
reforms across all payers, including in the commercial sector in
addition to Part D, as the current construct does not allow for two
separate list prices (i.e., one list price for Part D and a different
list price for the commercial sector). Therefore, we also support
efforts to eliminate rebates in the commercial sector, and recommend
that Congress explore such legislation. While eliminating rebates is an
important step, benefit designs must also be evaluated.

Question Submitted by Hon. Maggie Hassan
Question. In June of 2018, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access
Commission (MACPAC) unanimously recommended under Recommendation 1.1 in
their annual report to Congress that Congress remove the statutory
requirement that manufacturers blend the average manufacturer price
(AMP) of a brand drug and its authorized generic.\3\ This requirement
created an unintended loophole. Rather than use the price of the
authorized generic, drug companies can sell its authorized generic to a
corporate subsidiary at an artificially lower price, and use that lower
price to bring down the AMP, which in turn lowers the rebate
obligation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ MACPAC, ``Improving Operations of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program,'' https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Improving-
Operations-of-the-Medicaid-Drug-Rebate-Program.pdf.
Does your company engage in this practice? Has your company ever
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
engaged in this practice in the past?
Answer. No. In limited circumstances, AstraZeneca has made
authorized generics available, but does so through a third-party
distributor, not an AstraZeneca subsidiary.
______
Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
Question. As a portion of your revenue, for what percentage of the
drugs in your portfolio do you offer no rebates? Based on the drugs in
your pipeline, do you foresee that portion growing? For those drugs, is
your list price equal to your net price?
Answer. All of our medicines are rebated under the statutory
requirements of Medicaid, Federal Supply Schedule, 340B, and the Part D
coverage gap discount program. For our highly innovative, targeted
therapies, we do not typically provide additional rebates other than
through our value-based agreements, where such discounts are based on
patient outcomes. Therefore, due to statutory rebates and other fees
and discounts, the net price is lower than list price for all
medicines.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you generate in U.S. sales
revenue? Please include specific figures.
Answer. In 2018, AstraZeneca's U.S. revenue was $6.88 billion. We
invested $5.9 billion in R&D, globally.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
administration? What company functions do you consider to be included
in administration? Please include specific figures.
Answer. In 2018, we spent $5.9 billion on R&D and $10 billion on
Selling, General and Administrative (SG&A) costs globally, which is
inclusive of Sales and Marketing costs of $6.1 billion.
Selling, General and Administrative expenses are defined as fixed
costs of selling products and services and costs of central services
and administration, which are not included in inventory values.
General and administrative costs include costs of central services
and administration, such as: Human Resources, Finance, Facilities,
Purchasing, Strategy and Business Development, Legal, Corporate
Affairs, and other corporate expenses.
Our Sales and Marketing figures include all costs incurred in
selling, marketing, promoting, and distributing our products.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
sales? What company functions do you consider to be included in sales?
Please include specific figures.
Answer. In 2018, we spent $5.9 billion on R&D and $6.1 billion on
Sales and Marketing, globally.
Our Sales and Marketing figures include all costs incurred in
selling, marketing, promoting, and distributing our products.
Question. Why do you advertise for the drugs you manufacture? What
factors do you consider in choosing which drugs you advertise?
Answer. We consider many factors when making decisions regarding
the advertising of our medicines, including the opportunity to raise
brand and disease awareness, patient education, and the enhancement of
the patient/physician dialogue.
We believe that health-care communications efforts can have a
positive impact on patient health. AstraZeneca made a decision several
years ago to use our direct-to-consumer (DTC) advertisements to share
another important message with patients: We were the first company to
include messages about our affordability programs in all of our DTC TV
advertisements, making clear to patients that if they cannot afford
their medicines, AstraZeneca may be able to help. We continue this
practice today, which we believe is reflective of AstraZeneca's
commitment to patient access and affordability.

The Honorable Charles E. Grassley
Chairman
Committee on Finance
U.S. Senate
Washington, DC 20510
The Honorable Ron Wyden
Ranking Member
Committee on Finance
U.S. Senate
Washington, DC 20510
Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden:
AstraZeneca's CEO Pascal Soriot appeared before your Committee on
February 26, 2019 and answered a question from Senator Cortez Masto
regarding whether AstraZeneca offers authorized generic versions of any
of its products. At that time, Mr. Soriot indicated that AstraZeneca
does not offer any authorized generics, however, following the hearing,
Mr. Soriot was informed by AstraZeneca staff that an authorized generic
is currently available in the U.S. This letter is intended to correct
the record regarding that inadvertent oversight.
AstraZeneca does, in fact, currently have one authorized generic in
the U.S. market, and it was launched more than 3 years after the first
generic of that product was introduced. Authorized generics are not a
primary area of focus for AstraZeneca and are introduced on a selective
basis. In limited circumstances, AstraZeneca has made an authorized
generic available through a third-party distributor. Because patient
prescription access and coverage may vary with respect to branded
versus generic medicines, AstraZeneca believes it is important to keep
branded options available for patients who continue to rely on them.
We appreciate your invitation to discuss important issues of
patient access and affordability with the Committee and the opportunity
to supplement Mr. Soriot's testimony. We look forward to working with
you as a constructive partner in addressing challenges in our health-
care system.
Sincerely,
Christie Bloomquist
Vice President, Corporate Affairs, North America

can ensure that Americans have affordable access to the best healthcare
today and to the extraordinary medical breakthroughs of tomorrow.
I am Jennifer Taubert, and I lead the Janssen Pharmaceutical
Companies of Johnson & Johnson. At Janssen, we focus on discovering and
developing transformational medicines that treat and cure some of the
world's most challenging diseases, including blood cancers like
multiple myeloma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and mantle cell
lymphoma; prostate cancer; HIV; schizophrenia and other serious mental
illnesses; cardiovascular diseases; rheumatoid arthritis; Crohn's
Disease and other destructive gastrointestinal illnesses; and pulmonary
hypertension, among others.
Like many of you, I know what it's like when a loved one faces a
serious disease. My own mother died of lung cancer in 1988, in her 40s.
At the time, there was very little that could be done for my mom. I've
committed my career to bringing families genuine, meaningful hope--hope
for years of life, hope for the chance to be there for a daughter's
wedding or the birth of a grandchild.
commitment to innovation
Last year Janssen invested $8.4 billion globally in research and
development,\1\ making Janssen one of the world's top research and
development (``R&D'') investors in any industry, anywhere in the
world.\2\ In fact, our investment in R&D last year was 86 percent more
than we spent on sales and marketing. This substantial investment has
enabled us to research and develop more than 100 medicine candidates
last year; and, over the past 5 years, we have introduced six
innovative products in the U.S.\3\ The nine Breakthrough Therapy
Designations we have received from the Food and Drug Administration
(``FDA'') reflect the significance of the advances we are pursuing in
areas of profound unmet medical need.\4\

Our investment changes lives. It has helped turn HIV from a death
sentence into a manageable disease. Today, people with HIV can have a
near-normal life expectancy.\5\ And we are working on a vaccine with
the potential to eliminate HIV altogether. Our biologic therapies have
transformed the lives of patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease by
dramatically improving their quality of life. Our therapies have
reduced major bowel surgeries for patients with Crohn's Disease by 82
percent and cut hospitalizations by 65 percent.\6\ In ulcerative
colitis patients, our therapies have reduced the need for total
colectomy by 41 percent.\7\ One of our earliest pharmaceutical
innovations enabled people with serious mental illness to be treated at
home and in their communities rather than in psychiatric institutions,
and today our innovative first and only 4-time-a-year schizophrenia
treatment is improving adherence and breaking the cycle of
hospitalization so that people with schizophrenia can live their best
lives.\8\ In the area of mental health, we are also investigating a new
medicine for people suffering from treatment-resistant depression,
which profoundly impacts these patients and their families and loved
ones as well. Our first-in-class cancer medicines have helped patients
with some of the most common and deadly types of cancer live longer, in
some cases for many additional years.\9\, \10\ In multiple
myeloma, one of our medicines has more than doubled the length of time
patients live without return of their disease.\11\ We recently launched
a new prostate cancer treatment that delays the spread of the disease
by over an additional two years versus the prior standard of
care.\12\, \13\

This progress against some of the world's most challenging diseases
is heartening but hard-won. Continued advancement will require
perseverance and dedication. For example, we remain very committed to
continuing research exploring new approaches and investigational
medicines to prevent Alzheimer's dementia, which starts many years
before the full onset of disease. In fact, we have invested billions of
dollars in this area, and despite some significant projects that were
halted because of lack of efficacy or a newly identified imbalance in
benefit-risk, we continue to invest with the goal of conquering this
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
major public health challenge in our lifetimes.
Defeating Alzheimer's would not only change the lives of millions
of patients and their families, it would dramatically change the
economic burden of the disease. According to one analysis, if a new
treatment that delays the onset of Alzheimer's by just five years were
approved by 2025, the U.S. would save an estimated $367 billion each
year by 2050.\14\

In fact, across a wide range of conditions, prescription medicines
play a key role in keeping people well and productive and preventing
the need for costly procedures and hospitalizations. For example, since
the introduction of antiretroviral therapies, we've seen up to a
$402,000 lifetime cost savings for each HIV patient diagnosed at an
early stage.\15\ Cardiovascular medicines have led to a 27 percent
reduction in costs for hospitalizations and procedures.\16\ In fact,
the U.S. health-care system could save $213 billion annually with the
correct use of prescription medications.\17\, \18\

can't get them. We understand concerns about the cost of health care.
Although prescription medicines represent only 14 percent of overall
health-care spend--a figure that has remained relatively steady for the

our approach to pricing
At Janssen, we take a responsible approach to pricing that
recognizes our dual responsibility to patients today and patients
tomorrow. Patients today need access to our medicines. Patients
tomorrow count on us to deliver cures and treatments for the most
challenging, intractable diseases. When we set an initial price for our
medicines, we balance:

Value to patients, the health-care system, and society. We
consider how the medicine will improve patient health and
assess its potential to reduce other costs--surgeries, hospital
stays, or long-term care, for example--and the improvement the
medicine represents over the existing standard of care.

Affordable access to medicines for people who need them. We
want to ensure appropriate insurance coverage so that patients
who are prescribed our medicines can get them.

Ability to develop future groundbreaking cures and
treatments. We have an obligation to ensure we have the
resources necessary to invest in future R&D to address serious
unmet medical needs.
The list price of a medicine is a starting point that is ultimately
reduced by the substantial discounts, rebates, and fees we provide to
insurance companies, pharmacy benefit managers (``PBMs''), government
programs, and others. We pay required discounts to government programs,
and we negotiate with private payers so that they will cover our
medicines and make them available to patients with lower out-of-pocket
cost. In 2018, we provided approximately $21 billion in discounts and
rebates on our medicines--an overall reduction from list price of 47
percent. For some of our medicines, and for some of our customers, we
pay discounts, rebates, and fees totaling well over 50 percent of our
list price--so middlemen in the supply chain in those cases realize a
majority of the revenue.
All told, while our 2018 aggregate list price increase was 6.3
percent,\21\ for the second year in a row discounts and rebates
outweighed that increase, and aggregate net price--in other words, the
real price--decreased by 6.8 percent.\22\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\21\ Represents the year-over-year change in the average list
price, or wholesale acquisition cost (``WAC'').
\22\ Represents the year-over-year change in the average net price,
which is WAC less rebates, discounts, and returns.
trends in pharmaceutical spending
The fact is that across the industry net prices for branded
medicines have increased well below the rate of medical inflation in
recent years.\23\, \24\, \25\, \26\ In
2017, the total expenditure on pharmaceuticals in the U.S. grew by only
0.4 percent, compared to a 3.9 percent increase in overall health
spending and a 4.6 percent increase in hospital spending.\27\

Unfortunately, these trends are not reflected in many patients'
experiences at the doctor's office or pharmacy counter. In fact, total
patient out-of-pocket spending on medicines grew by 54 percent from
2006 to 2016.\28\

One reason patient out-of-pocket spending has grown is due to
changes in how health insurance is designed and, specifically, how
pharmaceutical benefits are managed. As one recent analysis shows,
patients are required to pay 13 percent of overall pharmaceutical costs
versus only 3 percent of hospital costs--even though medicine can help
keep patients out of the hospital.\29\

The reality is that our health coverage system simply wasn't built
in anticipation of medicines that treat diseases previously only
treated with surgeries, hospitalizations and other complex
interventions. Medicines today can extend and transform life for people
facing very challenging, often relatively rare, diseases. It's critical
that we work together to ensure that today's medicines are more
accessible and affordable for patients while at the same time
preserving the incredible ecosystem of medical innovation that has
delivered so much and promises so much more.
solutions to address the challenges we face
Above all, we need an American solution to this American challenge.
We must maintain the hallmarks that make American health care
remarkable: access to innovative therapies, personal choice, and
doctors and patients making decisions based on what is right for each
individual.
At Janssen, we are committed to being part of the solution.
We believe open dialogue and partnership is essential to addressing
the challenges in our health-care system. That's why in 2016 we began
issuing an annual Janssen U.S. Transparency Report, sharing information
about how we invest our resources, price our medicines, and help people
who need Janssen medicines get access to them. Just recently, we
expanded our commitment to transparency, announcing plans to
voluntarily include list price and potential patient out-of-pocket
costs in our pharmaceutical direct-to-consumer TV advertising, starting
with our most frequently prescribed medicine.
These more recent steps build on a legacy of commitment to
transparency at Janssen. For example, we believe that making clinical
trial data available promotes the understanding of disease, expands the
knowledge needed to develop new treatments, and generates new insights
and more complete evidence that lead to better health-care decisions
for patients. In a first-of-its-kind agreement with the Yale University
School of Medicine, we share clinical trial data through the Yale Open
Data Access (YODA) Project. Since 2014, YODA Project has served as an
independent review panel, evaluating researchers' requests for access
to participant-level trial data and research reports, which provide
extensive details about the methods and results of a clinical trial.
Researchers can use these clinical trial data in their own research to
increase medical knowledge and improve public health.
In the same spirit of open dialogue and partnership, we have
consistently brought forward ideas and perspectives to both Congress
and the administration, with the goal of building on what is working in
our healthcare system while fixing what is not:
part d out-of-pocket cap
While Medicare Part D is working for many seniors and has been
effective in containing costs, we believe an out-of-pocket cap in
Medicare Part D is a needed protection. Without a cap, Medicare
beneficiaries face unlimited out-of-pocket expenses, and, as research
shows, high out-of-pocket costs reduce patient adherence to prescribed
treatments and make them more likely to abandon their prescriptions.
Poor patient outcomes related to lack of adherence or abandonment of
prescribed treatments can lead to an increase in overall health-care
costs.
Individual and group health insurance policies are already required
to have out-of-pocket caps. We believe that Medicare, which serves some
of the sickest and most vulnerable patients and is essential to the
health of American seniors, should also have that protection. We have
been working on policy approaches that would make it possible to
implement an out-of-pocket cap in a fiscally responsible way without
creating new costs or access barriers for patients. As Congress
considers any changes to Part D, we look forward to discussing these
ideas in more depth.
medicare part b reform
We believe policy solutions in Medicare Part B should meet three
objectives: (1) reduce cost and spending; (2) increase competition; and
(3) remove incentives to prescribe higher cost therapies without
causing significant disruption to physicians or patient care.
As changes to Part B are contemplated, it is important to remember
that Medicare currently benefits from aggressive negotiations in the
commercial market through the Average Sales Price (ASP) mechanism. Any
reform should therefore leverage the benefits of the existing system.
In our response to the Health and Human Services advance notice of
proposed rulemaking regarding Part B, we proposed an option that would
allow Medicare to continue to achieve the negotiated cost savings of
the free market, reduce Part B acquisition cost under the ASP-based
model, and reimburse all stakeholders on a fee-based mechanism aligned
with the services that they provide. Our proposal aims to eliminate
incentives for selecting higher list price drugs while maintaining
current Part B patient access to appropriate clinical care.
rebate reform
We support reforms to the rebate system that restructure incentives
to ensure patients benefit from a competitive marketplace and see lower
out-of-pocket costs. In 2017, the pharmaceutical industry paid $150
billion in negotiated rebates and discounts.\30\ As we have noted, too
often these rebates and discounts are not shared with patients, leaving
the sickest patients paying higher out-of-pocket costs. We anticipate
eliminating rebates could result in lower list prices, provided these
rebates and discounts are not replaced with equally high fees or other
payments demanded by middlemen. We also strongly advocate that
beneficiary copays be based on net price.

2017.'' Drug Channels (April 24, 2018) (citing IQVIA Institute for

www.iqvia.com/institute/reports/medicine-use-and-spending-in-the-us-
review-of-2017-outlook-to-2022.
Altering the current rebate structure would be a major change to
the entire pharmaceutical supply chain. It would need to be done
thoughtfully and carefully to avoid disruption for patients. We look
forward to commenting on the administration's proposed rule in this
area.
value-based care
Our current system rewards the quantity or volume of care
delivered, regardless of the results of that care. Consequently,
sometimes we spend money on treatments, diagnostic procedures, and
surgeries that provide limited value or may not even be needed, driving
up health-care costs without actually improving patient health.
At Janssen, we're working with partners throughout the health-care
system to encourage more results-based health-care approaches. While we
have negotiated several value-based contracts, current policy often
limits our ability to implement creative solutions. To address policy
barriers, we support the following measures:

Establish safe harbors in the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute
that better enable manufacturers to partner with payors and
share risk; and,

Clarify Medicaid pricing treatment, including existing
Medicaid best price requirements that inhibit companies from
offering arrangements that may yield lower price in some
circumstances.
promoting competition on a level playing field
Biosimilars--near copies of biologic medicines--have the potential
to increase competition and bring down costs, which is why Janssen has
long supported a
patient-focused, science-based regulatory framework for biosimilars.
Some stakeholders have called for government to drive uptake by
creating further incentives for biosimilars. But policies designed to
increase share for biosimilar manufacturers would distort the
competitive environment and risk limiting the savings biosimilars
deliver to patients and taxpayers. We saw this risk realized most
recently in the 340B Drug Discount Program, where policy designed to
encourage the use of biosimilars had the unfortunate effect of
increasing cost to patients, including low-income patients who can
least afford it, and to taxpayers.\31\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\31\ Center for Biosimilars. ``340B Changes: What Biosimilar
Manufacturers Need to Know.'' Feb. 19, 2018. https://
www.centerforbiosimilars.com/contributor/amanda-forys/2018/02/340b-
changes-what-biosimilar-manufacturers-need-to-know.
When it comes to making more biosimilars available for patients and
their physicians, competition, not government intervention, is the best
approach. And that approach is working. Not only is competition driving
prices down for both innovator biologics and biosimilars, the
biosimilars pipeline is strong. Competition on a level playing field
will keep it that way.
340b policy
At Janssen, we recognize that the 340B Drug Discount Program plays
an important role in the healthcare system, helping to ensure that low-
income, needy patients have appropriate access to medicine. However,
congressional oversight, proper implementation, and equitable
application of the program are essential to ensuring the 340B program
is helping those it was designed to help.
Under the 340B Drug Discount Program, we are required to provide
significant discounts on certain medicines purchased by 340B covered
entities (comprised of specific categories of hospitals, clinics, and
health centers that meet Federal eligibility requirements). Growth in
the 340B program has been well documented, and Janssen has experienced
significant growth in this highly discounted channel as well. Although
the program was intended to benefit needy patients, the facilities
themselves receive the discounts. There is no requirement that 340B
covered hospitals pass along those discounts to patients. 340B covered
hospitals can therefore access 340B pricing on outpatient drugs for all
of their patients, including wealthy and well-insured patients.
A more direct and accountable link between the provision of the
discount and patient access is needed. We believe the benefits of the
program should flow more directly and transparently to needy patients.
We support efforts to strengthen the 340B program through greater
transparency and increased clarity and accountability for all
stakeholders. These goals can be achieved through the establishment of
clear, reasonable and auditable rules including a clear definition of
``patient'' as well as hospital eligibility criteria.
conclusion
We are here today at a moment of incredible hope, on the verge of
extraordinary progress that could change our lives and the lives of our
children and grandchildren. We have the opportunity to get this right
for Americans today and for future generations. At Janssen, we are
committed to bringing that promise to life with transformational
medical innovation.

Questions Submitted for the Record to Jennifer Taubert
Questions Submitted by Hon. Chuck Grassley
spending on advertising/marketing vs. research and development
Question. The Department of Health and Human Services' proposed
rule, ``Fraud and Abuse; Removal of Safe Harbor Protection for Rebates
Involving Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Creation of New Safe Harbor
Protection for Certain Point-of-Sale Reductions in Price on
Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Certain Pharmacy Benefit Manager
Service Fees,'' envisions that drug manufacturers will offer up-front
discounts rather than the back-end rebates that are now commonly
provided. Some observers argue that a 1996 court case called into
question whether manufacturers could offer up-front discounts,
resulting in today's rebate-based system. I've heard differing opinions
as to whether the issues related to the initial court case are still
relevant. If the HHS proposed rule is finalized, can you assure the
committee that your company will offer up-front discounts? If not, why?
Please describe how you expect your company to respond to the HHS
proposed rule to eliminate safe harbor protection for back-end rebates
in Medicare Part D that is referenced above if it is finalized.
Assuming you are confident that antitrust laws do not prevent your
company from offering up-front discounts, specifically, do you envision
that your company lowers the list price of a drug to the current after-
rebate net price, offer discounts equal to the current rebate amount,
or a combination of both?
Answer. The 1996 antitrust law case cited, in our assessment,
should not limit the ability to move from rebates to other types of
discounts. Depending on whether elimination of rebates applies to the
entire market or only to those related to Federal health plans and
assuming rebates are not replaced by high fees or other costs that
offset the amount saved, we expect to lower list prices or offer
discounts for pass-through at the point of sale. In either case, we
would need to renegotiate our agreements with customers.
The degree to which we can convert current rebates to list price
reductions or point-of-sale discounts will depend upon the details of
the final regulation and the reactions of other stakeholders in the
supply chain. We are concerned that PBMs may seek to replace rebate
revenue with new and increasing fees or may seek to shift costs among
supply chain participants through service fees.
Question. To what extent are the back-end rebates your company
currently offers contingent on the amount of market share realized for
your drugs as a result of Part D plan formulary placement and other
techniques?
Answer. Janssen does not currently offer rebates contingent on the
amount of market share for our drugs as a result of Medicare Part D
formulary placement. In other words, Janssen's current Medicare Part D
rebate agreements do not contain any market share performance
requirement.
Question. Please provide a breakdown of percentage of sales that go
to each payer (including Medicare, Medicaid, private pay, other) and a
similar percentage by volume of the total number of each drug compared
to total volume. Please provide this data for the most recent year
available.
Answer. Potentially responsive information may not be maintained by
the company in the ordinary course of business. As such, an answer to
this question is not readily available.
Question. Do your companies hire consultants or lobbyists to
promote products at State Medicaid Pharmacy and Therapeutics
Committees? To whom do you disclose advocacy activities surrounding
State Medicaid programs, if at all?
Answer. Janssen does not hire external lobbyists or consultants for
the purpose of promoting products at State Medicaid Pharmacy and
Therapeutics Committees. We have internal employees who register as
lobbyists and provide information about Janssen products to State
Medicaid Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee personnel. We comply with
varied State laws regarding advocacy, including disclosure
requirements.
Question. Please describe how the costs of patient assistance
programs are accounted for within your company's financial statements.
Please also describe the types of market information, such as
prescribing and use patterns, that your company collects from different
types of patient assistance programs and patient hub services.
Answer. Our patient assistance programs include both commercial
copay support programs and charitable donations, which include both
financial contributions and pharmaceutical products.
With respect to Janssen's copay card programs, the value of patient
copayment support is recorded as a reduction in sales revenue. The
administrative costs associated with implementing the copayment
programs are captured in selling, marketing and administrative expenses
on Johnson & Johnson's SEC Form 10K.
With respect to the company's charitable free product programs,
Janssen donates prescription products to the Johnson & Johnson Patient
Assistance Foundation, Inc. (``JJPAF''), a 501(c)(3) organization with
an independent board and decision-making. Janssen also makes financial
contributions to JJPAF and other independent 501(c)(3) organizations.
These product and financial donations are recorded as charitable
deductions.
With respect to our commercial patient assistance programs, we
collect information that is needed to support administering the
program, helping patients get access to the medically appropriate
treatment they have selected, and identifying and addressing barriers
to patient access.
Question. Please provide a list of all contributions since January
1, 2014, that your company has made to any tax-exempt organizations
working on issues related to drugs within your product lines, including
but not limited to patient groups, disease awareness groups, medical or
professional societies, universities or hospitals, industry
associations or leagues. For each contribution, please provide the name
of the organization that received the donation, the date the donation
was made, the amount of the donation, and a description of the purpose
of the contribution (i.e., was the contribution for the general fund, a
specific purpose to a specific program, or continuing medical
education). Please also note whether the contribution was unrestricted
or restricted; if it was restricted, please explain all restrictions.
Finally, if your company maintains a foundation or other separate
charitable arm, please provide the name of all such entities, and list
all donations made from that entity or entities.
Answer. Through our Janssen charitable giving, we're proud to make
a difference for patients and for the communities where we live and
work. Janssen provides charitable donations through an established
application review and approval process designed to ensure that the
recipient of any contribution (i) is a valid 501(c)(3) charitable
organization; (ii) has an established, good reputation; and (iii) is
not on a Federal exclusion list (if the non-profit is a provider or
government contractor). In addition, the charitable contributions
review process is designed to review requests for donations to make
sure that they are not made for the purpose of inducing the use or
recommending the use of any J&J product.
Janssen releases a contributions transparency report
(``Contributions Report'') that details all of the charitable donations
from the company for the prior year. Please see the attached link for
the most recently posted Contributions Report, https://www.janssen.com/
us/transparency/educational-charitable-contribution-disclosures.
With respect to the Contributions Report, please note:

In keeping with our donor agreements and applicable
regulatory guidance, financial donations made to independent
charitable foundations that assist patients who are
underinsured and in need of financial assistance with
treatment-related expenses are disclosed in aggregate on the
Janssen Contributions Report.

Charitable contributions made by recently acquired company
Actelion are not included in our report. In future years, these
donations will be included in the Contributions Report.

Donations in the amount of $270,000 have been made annually
to support the mission of PhRMA Foundation. These donations
were made on April 29, 2014; January 21, 2015; December 21,
2015; September 11, 2017; June 1, 2018; and January 15, 2019.
Contribution Reports for years 2014 through 2017 are attached.
Most donation requests seek support for a specific program or
initiative. If approved, the use of the contributed funds will be
restricted to the purpose set forth in the application request. The
Contribution Report details this purpose in the project title section.
In addition, the company's standard donation agreement used for
most contributions stipulates that funds should not be used to (i)
educate, train or support meals, salary, travel, consulting fees or any
other reimbursement to U.S.-licensed physicians; or (ii) fund services
for which the organization receives government reimbursement under a
fee-for-service model.
Janssen makes financial contributions and prescription product
donations to the Johnson & Johnson Patient Assistance Foundation, Inc.
(``JJPAF''), a 501(c)(3) organization with an independent board and
decision-making. The JJPAF provides free products directly to patients
who meet certain income requirements and who do not have insurance
coverage. In limited circumstances, JJPAF may work with other non-
profit entities to distribute products to patients in need. JJPAF does
not advise Janssen of the specific recipients of its donations.
In 2018, Janssen donated approximately $1 billion in free product
and financial support to the JJPAF, enabling it to provide medicines at
no cost to approximately 76,000 patients.
The Johnson & Johnson Foundation (``JJF'') is a private non-profit
501(c)(3) organization, founded in 1953. Solely funded by the Johnson &
Johnson Family of Companies, the Foundation is responsible for managing
the Corporation's Global Community Impact (``GCI'') programs and
activities across the globe. Donations made by this foundation are
available publicly through the IRS Form 990 it submits each year.
Question. Pay-for-delay agreements cost consumers and taxpayers
billions in higher drug costs every year. The FTC has gone after drug
companies that enter into these settlements where the brand pays the
generic company to keep its lower cost alternative off the market. I'm
the lead Republican sponsor of S. 64, the Preserve Access to Affordable
Generics and Biosimilars Act, which would help put an end to these
deals.
Do you agree that these pay-off agreements keep drug costs high for
patients because they delay competition?
Has your company ever entered into these kinds of settlements with
a generic company?
Do you support the pay for delay bill?
Answer. J&J has not entered into patent settlement agreements that
require payment of money to a generic manufacturer. Since J&J has not
entered into agreements of this type, we do not have direct experience
with their competitive impacts. The current legal framework--FTC
oversight and judicial review on a case-by-case basis--is intended to
identify any patent settlement that is anti-competitive. It is
important to note that not all settlement agreements would result in a
delay in competition; for example, some agreements of this type might
facilitate generic entry prior to patent expiry.
Although we believe that the current legal framework is sufficient
to ensure that patent settlements are not anti-competitive, we would
not oppose pay-for-delay legislation, provided that such legislation
clearly, and in a manner consistent with current case law, defines the
specific features of settlement agreements within its scope, does not
hinder the ability of parties to utilize settlement agreements to
efficiently settle patent disputes, and allows for an assessment of the
competitive impacts of individual settlement agreements on a case-by-
case basis.
rebate traps/walls
Question. I'm increasingly concerned about the effect of so-called
``rebate traps'' or ``rebate walls'' on patients' access to quality,
lower cost medicine. I understand there is ongoing litigation
challenging these practices as anti-competitive.
Does your company engage in the bundling of rebates over multiple
products? If so, why? And what benefit does the consumer gain from
that?
Answer. Like other companies with broad portfolios of medicines
that are highly valued by payers, health-care providers, and patients,
Janssen offers incremental value when customers make a broader range of
our medicines available to patients. Similar programs are common in the
pharmaceutical and other industries. These programs provide an
incentive for the customer to utilize our products and can lower costs.
Those savings may be passed through to patients.
Question. Does your company view these practices as anticompetitive
or harmful to patients' access to quality, lower cost medicine?
Answer. Janssen's contract offerings encourage price competition
among drug manufacturers and ultimately enhance patients' access to
quality medicines at lower prices.
Question. If a policy were adopted to eliminate rebates, or to
require that rebate savings be passed on to the consumer, would that in
and of itself solve the issue of rebate ``traps'' and ``walls''? And
would consumers benefit from such a policy?
Answer. We support reforms to the rebate system that restructure
incentives to ensure patients benefit from a competitive marketplace
and see lower out-of-pocket costs.
It is important to note that in today's health-care marketplace,
payers use their ability to influence utilization to extract rebates,
thereby enhancing competition and lowering overall system costs.
Unfortunately, these savings are not usually shared with patients.
Similarly, if rebates are eliminated, we anticipate that payers
will use their ability to influence utilization to extract discounts
and fees from manufacturers.
drug pricing
Question. When setting the list price of a drug, does your company
consider regulatory costs or compliance? If so, how specifically do
those factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at least
one specific example, if applicable, from your current product
portfolio.
When setting the list price of a drug, does your company consider
the risk of liability or litigation? If so, how specifically do those
factors affect the list price of a drug? Please provide at least one
specific example, if applicable, from your current product portfolio.
Answer. At Janssen, we take a responsible approach to pricing that
recognizes our dual responsibility to patients today and patients
tomorrow. Patients today need access to our medicines. Patients
tomorrow count on us to deliver cures and treatments for the most
challenging, intractable diseases. When we set an initial list price
for our medicines, we balance:

Value to patients, the health-care system, and society.
We consider how the medicine will improve
patient health. We also assess the medicine's potential to
reduce other costs--surgeries, hospital stays, or long-term
care, for example--and the improvement the medicine represents
over the existing standard of care.

The importance of maintaining affordable access to medicines
for people who need them.
We work with insurers, pharmacy benefits
managers, governments, hospitals, physicians, and other
providers of care so that patients who are prescribed our
medicines can get access to them.

The importance of preserving our ability to develop future
groundbreaking cures and treatments.
We have an obligation to ensure that the sale
of our medicines provides us with the resources to invest in
R&D to address serious, unmet medical needs.
In addition, the sale of our medicines must enable us to cover the
costs of compliance with all laws and regulations.
Regarding the requests for specific examples from our current
product portfolio, the information requested is confidential and
competitively sensitive. As such, potentially responsive information is
not available for public disclosure.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Pat Roberts
Question. What role do you see value-based arrangements (VBAs)
playing in the effort to reduce prescription drug costs? What potential
do these arrangements have to find the ``sweet spot'' between
controlling costs to patients and encouraging innovation of new drugs?
Answer. We believe a value-based health-care system has tremendous
potential to improve patient health, increase access to care, and curb
the growth in health-care spending. Our current health-care system
rewards the quantity or volume of care delivered, regardless of the
results of that care. Consequently, sometimes money is spent on
treatments, diagnostic procedures, and interventions that provide
limited value or may not even be needed, driving up healthcare costs
without actually improving patient health.
Shifting to a value-based system requires innovation in the way
contracts between payers and manufacturers are structured. By creating
common incentives to deliver value for patients, value-based
agreements, including innovative approaches to contracting models, can
provide better outcomes at lower costs. We have established several
innovative, value-based contracts and continue to explore new
opportunities. For example, we have contracts tied to measurable
medical outcomes and contracts tied to offsets of other expenditures.
Fundamentally we believe a value-based health system will drive
down the amount of waste in our current health-care system, so the
money spent actually makes a measurable difference in individual health
and the health of our society overall. Efforts to achieve a more value-
based system have encouraged all stakeholders to more clearly define
and measure the value of health-care services offered, including
medicines. In a health-care system that rewards value over volume, we
believe incentives will be greater to bring to market new drugs that
can reduce the need for other costly health-care intervention and
ultimately produce better health outcomes and lower cost.
Question. How can VBAs help lower what patients pay out-of-pocket?
Answer. Innovative contracting models can align the incentives of
all stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies, health-care
providers, and payers, to achieve better outcomes for patients at a
lower overall cost of care to the health-care system, including Federal
programs. In most cases, because the pharmaceutical company agrees to
share some of the risk around the economics of the arrangement for a
particular medicine, the health plan or PBM will provide better access
to that medicine, which may entail placing the medicine on a lower
formulary tier. Lower formulary tier placement results in lower out-of-
pocket costs for patients. We know that rising patient copayments are a
barrier to adherence and therefore to optimal outcomes. We believe that
keeping out-of-pocket costs reasonable for patients is an important
element of getting to better outcomes, and innovative contracts can
support this goal.
According to an analysis by PhRMA and Avalere Health, commercially
insured patients in health plans with outcome-based contracts for
diabetes, high cholesterol and HIV medicines between 2015 and 2017 had
copays that were, on average, 28 percent lower for those medicines
compared to patients in other plans.
Question. Can Congress do more to allow for and encourage the use
of VBAs?
Answer. We are enthusiastic about the potential for expanding the
use of innovative value-based agreements. Nevertheless, a number of
technological and policy barriers can make these agreements challenging
to implement. To address technological barriers, we advocate for
modernizing our healthcare data system to make it easier to track
patient outcomes. To address policy barriers, we support the following
approaches: establishing safe harbors to better enable manufacturers to
partner with payers and share risk; clarifying the treatment of value-
based contracts in government price calculations, including in the
complex Medicaid Best Price determination; and making comparative
formulary and cost-sharing information readily available so patients
have the information they need to make better decisions.

Questions Submitted by Hon. John Cornyn
Question. We continue to hear that rebates negotiated off of the
list price of a drug are both good and bad.
Pharmacy benefit managers and plans have argued that rebates are
used to lower premiums across the board and that it is the best way to
seek a price concession on otherwise expensive drugs.
Your industry argues that these payers are insisting on higher
rebates that can only be achieved by raising list prices. But patients
often lose under this system, with out of pocket costs being tied to
list price. Insulin patients appear to be routinely impacted by this
perversity in the system.
Please explain to the committee how your company would reduce list
prices if rebates were no longer a part of the equation?
What assurance can you provide that you would in fact lower your
prices?
What actions should be taken to ensure that patients are actually
seeing the benefits of lower out of pocket costs?
Answer. Depending on whether elimination of rebates applies to the
entire market or only to those related to Federal health plans and
assuming rebates are not replaced by high fees or other costs that
offset the amount saved, we expect to lower list prices or offer
discounts for pass-through at the point of sale. In either case, we
would need to renegotiate our agreements with customers.
The degree to which we can convert current rebates to list price
reductions or point-of-sale discounts will depend upon the details of
the final regulation and the reactions of other stakeholders in the
supply chain. We are concerned that PBMs may seek to replace rebate
revenue with new and increasing fees or may seek to shift costs among
supply chain participants through service fees.
We support reforms to the rebate system that restructure incentives
to ensure patients benefit from rebates and discounts that are
provided.
Question. If rebates are driving high list prices for drugs as drug
manufacturers' claim, why do you think that Part B drugs, which have no
PBM rebates, are also seeing significant price increases? Whose fault
is that?
Answer. Part B benefits from competitive commercial rebates and
discounts, while maintaining access to medicines for our nation's
seniors, through the Average Selling Price (``ASP''). ASP, which is the
basis for Part B drug reimbursement, reflects all commercial discounts
and rebates. Since both provider reimbursement and patient out-of-
pocket costs for Part B drugs are based on ASP, changes in a product's
ASP is a more relevant indicator of true cost to the Medicare system
and beneficiaries.
______
Question Submitted by Hon. Michael B. Enzi
Question. The Food and Drug Administration's drug review process is
known to many as the ``gold standard'' for evaluating medical products.
I've long thought that it is critical that we maintain public
confidence in their ability to ensure that drugs are safe and
effective. There is a perception among some, however, that biosimilars
might not be as safe as their reference products. That perception can
undermine patient and provider confidence. Do you believe that when FDA
approves a biosimilar, providers can be confident that it is safe and
effective?
Answer. Biosimilars granted licensure by the FDA are by definition
safe and effective and are highly similar to the reference biologic. We
support the FDA's application of rigorous scientific standards and
appropriate data requirements for the licensure of both biosimilars and
interchangeable biosimilars, and we believe evidence and experience
will drive patient and provider confidence in these products.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Todd Young
re-evaluating business strategies in foreign countries
Question. Since taking office, President Trump has made reducing
drug prices one of his highest priorities--and has repeatedly spoken
about his frustration with the U.S. subsidizing the costs of
pharmaceuticals for the rest of the world. He has gone so far as to
issue proposals, like the International Pricing Index (IPI) Model, in
an attempt to bring down prescription drug prices.
With the increased scrutiny of the industry and of the drug supply
chain as a whole in the United States, have any of your companies re-
evaluated your business strategy in foreign countries?
If not, then why?
If a proposal, like IPI, were implemented, would it force your
companies to potentially ``walk away from the negotiating table when
other countries demand low prices subsidized by America's seniors,'' as
HHS Senior Advisor for Drug Pricing Reform John O'Brien has said?
What are some of your ideas on how we can ensure Americans aren't
shouldering the full cost of pharmaceuticals?
Answer. We continuously evaluate our global business strategy and
country-
specific market access approaches in light of current conditions,
including changing policies and circumstances.
We support the use of trade tools to improve the policy environment
for U.S. companies operating overseas and to enhance incentives for
innovation. The U.S. government has already taken steps to advance this
goal with some of our key trading partners. The U.S. Mexico Canada
Agreement (``USMCA'') includes important provisions committing Canada
and Mexico to recognize the value of pharmaceuticals either through the
operation of competitive markets or through procedures that
appropriately value pharmaceuticals. The agreement also contains
procedural safeguards for U.S. companies. These include a requirement
that Canada and Mexico provide opportunities for stakeholder comment on
measures before they are finalized and also offer U.S. companies an
opportunity to appeal administrative actions. These are critical tools
that will help American companies obtain fair value for innovation
outside the U.S.
The U.S. government has announced its intention to negotiate trade
agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the United Kingdom.
These negotiations could address inadequacies in the systems of some
our largest trading partners.
The U.S. government can also effectively leverage existing trade
agreements and tools like Organisation for Economic Cooperation
accession negotiations to induce foreign governments to provide
appropriate value for innovation and offer greater incentives for new
treatments and cures.
foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
Question. President Trump and Secretary Azar have both repeatedly
described their frustrations with ``foreign freeloading'' of U.S. drugs
in the last year.
``When foreign governments extort unreasonably low prices from U.S.
drug makers, Americans have to pay more to subsidize the enormous cost
of research and development. . . . It's unfair and it's ridiculous, and
it's not going to happen any longer.''
Do you agree that because of foreign countries' pricing and
reimbursement systems, U.S. patients and innovators are shouldering the
burden for financing medical advances?
Answer. According to a report by the U.S. Department of Commerce,
international reference pricing and controls suppress worldwide private
research and development by up to 16 percent annually, leading to fewer
new medicines launched each year. Conversely, recent estimates
demonstrate that removing price controls in other wealthy countries
would increase the number of available new treatments by 9 percent by
2030, equivalent to a range of 8 to 13 new therapeutics that year.
Question. How do foreign countries' pricing and reimbursement
systems affect our prescription drug costs?
Answer. While there is no direct relationship between U.S. drug
prices and foreign prices, according to a report by the U.S. Department
of Commerce, existing foreign price controls suppress worldwide private
research and development and decrease the number of new treatments and
cures, to the detriment of U.S. patients.
It is important to note that most cross-country pricing comparisons
focus solely on the list prices of medicines and do not account for the
significant discounts required for participation in U.S. public
programs, such as Medicaid, the 340B Drug Discount Program, and the
Federal Supply Schedule (for U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and
the Department of Defense), as well as the discounts and rebates
negotiated by private payers. For this reason, most international
comparisons are not ``apples to apples.'' In addition, in other
countries, medicine prices are achieved through national regulation,
which often restricts or delays access to innovative medicines and
limits patient and physician choice.
Question. Are foreign governments taking note of the concerns being
raised by the Trump administration and have they responded in any way?
Answer. We understand that some foreign government officials have
noted the concerns raised by the Trump administration and appear to be
seeking a better understanding of the proposed policy changes in the
United States and the potential future impacts on their countries.
Question. Has there been any noticeable change in any of our trade
agreements since these concerns have been raised by the Trump
administration?
Answer. The U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (``USMCA'') contains
important provisions on intellectual property that establish a higher
global IP standard than in previous agreements, particularly with
respect to data protection for biologics. The agreement also contains
important provisions committing Canada and Mexico to recognize the
value of pharmaceuticals either through the operation of competitive
markets or through procedures that appropriately value pharmaceuticals.
The agreement includes procedural safeguards for U.S. companies. These
include a requirement that Canada and Mexico provide opportunities for
stakeholder comment on measures before they are finalized and also
offer U.S. companies an opportunity to appeal administrative actions.
These are critical tools that will help American companies obtain fair
value for innovation. The U.S. government has announced its intention
to negotiate trade agreements with Japan, the European Union, and the
United Kingdom. These negotiations could address inadequacies in the
systems of some our largest trading partners. The U.S. government can
also effectively leverage existing trade agreements and tools like
Organisation for Economic Co-operation accession negotiations to induce
foreign governments to provide appropriate value for innovation and
offer greater incentives for new treatments and cures.
medicaid closed formulary proposals
Question. In an attempt to bring down drug costs, various states
have been exploring whether to exclude certain drugs from its Medicaid
program. For example, the state of Massachusetts' recently asked CMS
for permission to create a closed formulary where the state Medicaid
program would pick at least one drug per therapeutic class. CMS denied
their waiver request citing violation of federal law, but this proposal
does bring up important questions on how to contain drug prices in
state Medicaid programs.
If the principles of the Medicare Part D program--including the
necessary patient protections--were applied to State Medicaid programs,
do you think it would lower drug costs while ensuring access to
patients?
Answer. By legislative design, the Medicaid Program already
receives the ``best'' price, in addition to substantial rebates
associated with an inflation penalty and negotiated supplemental
rebates. The rebate is never less than 23.1 percent, the required
statutory minimum, and often requires manufacturers to sell their
products (both older and newer) for as low as 1 cent per pill or unit.
The Medicaid drug rebate statute represents a carefully crafted
legislative approach developed by Congress and designed as a package to
offer Medicaid beneficiaries comprehensive coverage and access to
outpatient drugs at the lowest cost in the marketplace. We support the
significant access protections required under the current Medicaid Drug
Rebate Program that serve a uniquely vulnerable population. We also
question whether reducing access to medically necessary medication for
vulnerable Medicaid beneficiaries will yield true program savings. Any
further restrictions in medication access is likely to increase the
risk of higher costs elsewhere in the health-care continuum. Moreover,
vulnerable Medicaid beneficiaries may be particularly challenged to
navigate the administrative, technical, logistical and other challenges
that inevitably arise when additional restrictions are placed on their
access to care.
medicaid ``best price''
Question. In the Trump administration's Blueprint, they suggested
that because drug manufactures have to give Medicaid the ``best price''
on drugs, there is no incentive to offer deeper discounts to other
payers--both government and commercial--than what is already offered
under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Does the Medicaid ``best price'' requirement encourage
manufacturers to increase initial prices?
Answer. We take into account the Medicaid ``best price''
requirement at all stages of the drug lifecycle, including launch. We
consider best price when offering large discounts to commercial
customers after a drug is launched and when designing value-based
agreements.
Question. What, if any, changes would you suggest we make to the
program?
Answer. We are supportive of ongoing efforts to promote a value-
driven health-care system, including in Medicaid, and applaud recent
efforts by both the administration and Congress that seek to address
regulatory and legal uncertainty around value-based payment
arrangements. We also support CMS's recent approvals of State proposals
to advance specific Medicaid value-based arrangements with drug makers.
outcomes-based contracts
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you highlight your
support of outcomes-based contracts and how we need to be shifting our
system toward that approach.
How will these contracts lower drug costs for patients in both the
near term and long-term?
How will they lower overall health-care costs for our Federal
programs?
What have the preliminary results looked like so far?
Answer. Innovative contracting models can align the incentives of
all stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies, health-care
providers, and payers, to achieve better outcomes for patients at a
lower overall cost of care to the health-care system, including Federal
programs.
In most cases, because the pharmaceutical company agrees to share
some of the risk around the economics of the arrangement for a
particular medicine, the health plan or PBM will provide better access
to that medicine, which often entails placing the medicine on a more
preferable formulary tier. More preferable formulary tier placement
results in lower out-of-pocket costs for patients. We know that rising
patient copayments are a barrier to adherence and therefore to optimal
outcomes. We believe that keeping out-of-pocket costs reasonable for
patients is an important element of getting to better outcomes, and
innovative contracts can support this goal.
According to an analysis by PhRMA and Avalere Health, commercially
insured patients in health plans with outcome-based contracts for
diabetes, high cholesterol and HIV medicines between 2015 and 2017 had
copays that were, on average, 28 percent lower for those medicines
compared to patients in other plans.
Innovative contracting models are still relatively new, and we look
forward to the point at which we will have the long-term data necessary
to evaluate the success of these programs with respect to health-care
cost reduction. We are enthusiastic about the potential of innovative
value-based contracting models to enable us to take full advantage of
medicines' benefits, including their potential to reduce other health-
care costs.
transparency/point of sale
Question. In almost all of your testimonies, you express your
support for the Trump administration's proposal to allow manufacturers
to provide PBMs up-front discounts that are passed onto patients at the
point of sale.
Do you feel like this proposal will make the transactions within
the drug supply chain more transparent?
If so, would this transparency bring down drug costs--overall and
for specialty drugs?
Answer. We do believe that a point-of-sale discount model, wherein
manufacturer discounts could be passed through to a patient at the
point-of-sale, will make price reductions offered by the manufacturer
more transparent because these discounts would be more directly
reflected in patient out-of-pocket cost at the pharmacy. However, we do
not believe that the proposal will improve transparency with respect to
fees or mark-ups to the price of drugs added elsewhere in the supply
chain.
Depending on whether elimination of rebates applies to the entire
market or only with respect to Federal health plans and assuming
rebates are not replaced by high fees or other costs that offset the
amount saved, we expect to lower list prices or offer discounts for
pass-through at the point of sale.
the relationship between wholesalers and manufacturers
Question. When talking about the pharmaceutical supply chain, a lot
of focus has been placed on the pharmacy benefit manager. But there's
another side of the equation that I'd like to ask about: how do
wholesalers negotiate pricing with manufacturers?
Answer. Janssen sells to wholesalers and specialty distributors at
list price, with discounts customarily offered for prompt payment.
Janssen occasionally offers discounts to wholesalers for discrete
periods of time on certain products. These are generally offered to
contracted, authorized wholesalers market-wide. In addition, Janssen
negotiates service agreements with wholesalers and specialty
distributors for bona fide services relating to distribution of Janssen
products.
Question. What impact does this have on drug costs?
Answer. We do not know the details of the wholesalers' arrangements
with downstream stakeholders such as pharmacies, hospitals, providers,
and other sites of care.
Question. What incentives or disincentives do they have to contain
price increases?
Answer. We are not in a position to comment on wholesaler
incentives or disincentives to contain price increases.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Ron Wyden
proposed rebate rule
Question. As has been done in many other settings, drug
manufacturers said during the hearing that one reason list prices for
drugs are high is that pharmaceutical benefit managers (PBMs) demand
larger and larger rebates in order for the drug to receive favorable
placement on a formulary. You and your colleagues who testified during
the hearing stated if the administration's proposal on changes to the
anti-kickback safe harbor for pharmaceutical rebates took effect, your
company would likely lower list price.
Like many Oregonians, I am skeptical drug manufacturers would
voluntarily lower their prices. Therefore, would you support
legislation that would (1) make similar changes the administration has
put forward related to Part D and Medicaid managed care, (2) change the
rebate system in a similar way to the proposal for the commercial
market, and (3) require drug makers to lower the list price of their
drugs equal to the amount of rebates provided today?
Answer. We support reforms to the rebate system that restructure
incentives to ensure patients benefit from a competitive marketplace
and see lower out-of-pocket costs.
Depending on whether elimination of rebates applies to the entire
market or only to those related to Federal health plans and assuming
rebates are not replaced by high fees or other costs that offset the

medicaid drug rebate program
Question. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program (MDRP) requires
manufacturers to provide a basic rebate and an additional inflationary
rebate for both brand and generic drugs. The inflationary rebate is an
increasingly substantial part of total rebates due in large part to
large increases in drug prices that exceed inflation. Under current
law, this inflationary rebate is capped at 100 percent of Average
Manufacturer Price (AMP). This is the case even when manufacturers
continue to raise their prices well above inflation.
Please provide a list of all of your pharmaceutical products that
have reached the Medicaid AMP rebate cap in any of the 20 quarters from
January 1, 2014 through December 31, 2018.
For each drug listed in response to question 1, please also provide
a list of which quarters and years each drug hit the cap.
Answer. Janssen has numerous current products, and products that
have since been sold to third parties, that have reached the Medicaid
AMP rebate cap in at least one of the 20 quarters from 1Q 2014 through
4Q 2018. The fact that these products reaching the 100 percent AMP cap
is based on confidential metrics reported under the Medicaid Drug
Rebate Program. The Medicaid AMP rebate cap is reached when AMP is less
than or equal to the Unit Rebate Amount (URA). URA is calculated based
on AMP and Best Price--which are confidential under the Medicaid Drug
Rebate statute at 42 U.S.C. ' 1396r8(b)(3)(D). There are exceptions in
the statute that permit the Secretary and State Medicaid agencies to
disclose the information only in certain situations, including
disclosure to CBO. Thus, if there was legislation proposing to amend
the 100 percent AMP cap, CBO would be able to access the drugs and
underlying data to estimate the cost/savings to the government of such
a legislative change.
The product-specific information requested is confidential and
competitively sensitive. As such, potentially responsive information is
not available for public disclosure.
medicaid drug rebate program compliance
Question. I am concerned about recent reports and legal settlements
surrounding drug manufacturers' failure to comply fully with the
requirements of the MDRP. For example, an analysis by the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General
found that between 2012 and 2016 taxpayers may have overpaid by as much
as $1.3 billion for 10 potentially misclassified drugs. That is why I
introduced the Right Rebate Act with Chairman Grassley to prevent drug
manufacturers from manipulating Medicaid to increase their profits.
However, I continued to be concerned about oversight and manufacturer
compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
Accordingly, please describe the following:
Your company's current compliance plan and procedures used to
ensure compliance with the requirements of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program including internal audits or other checks you use to identify
compliance vulnerabilities.
Any past or ongoing issues of non-compliance.
Any corrective actions taken to address identified problems or
issues of non-
compliance with the MDRP and how such steps were communicated to the
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.
Any steps taken to improve compliance and ensure that all Medicaid
drug rebates owed to the Federal Government and the States are paid in
full.
Answer. We comply with the obligations we undertake when
participating in U.S. Federal, State, or local government contracts and
government pricing programs such as the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program.
We have an established compliance framework along with organizational
structure and accountabilities designed to assure compliance. Our
framework includes testing and monitoring and an obligation to correct
any identified discrepancies. As such, any discrepancies have been
timely addressed and corrected.
The other information requested is confidential. As such,
potentially responsive information is not available for public
disclosure.
bonus payments tied to specific drugs
Question. I am concerned by the potential for employee financial
incentives to encourage high launch prices and price increases for
prescription drugs.
Is your salary, bonus or other compensation tied to sales or
revenue targets of a single product your company sells? Has it ever
been? If yes, please state the product or products to which your
salary, bonus or other compensation was tied.
Answer. At no time during her employment with the Johnson & Johnson
Family of Companies has Ms. Taubert's salary, bonus, or other
compensation been tied to sales or revenue targets of a single product.
Question. Is your salary, bonus, or other compensation tied to
either revenue or net income of the company as a whole? Has it ever
been? If yes, please explain what assumptions about price increases are
used when the compensation committee sets revenue or net income goals.
Does the compensation committee provide any guidance to executives in
regards to the amount of revenue that the company will generate from
price increases versus volume growth?
Answer. We structure performance-based compensation to reward an
appropriate balance of short-term and long-term financial and strategic
business results, with an emphasis on managing the business for long-
term results. Our compensation program's emphasis on long-term value
reduces the possibility that our executives make excessively risky
business decisions that could maximize short-term results at the
expense of long-term value.
Ms. Taubert's base salary is tied to performance, market data,
responsibilities, time in position, internal equity, and experience.
Ms. Taubert's bonus and long-term incentive compensation has been and
is awarded based on her individual performance and the company's
performance.
The compensation committee does not provide guidance to executives
regarding the amount of revenue that the company will generate from
price increases versus volume growth.
provision of rebates in exchange for formulary placement
Question. In today's system, drug makers receive a limited time
window to sell their drug without competition. After that period has
expired, low-cost generics should become available. However, drug
makers often prevent access to these cheaper generic drugs in Medicare.
Researchers have found that 72 percent of Medicare Part D plans charged
lower cost-sharing for a brand name drug compared to its generic
equivalent. This means seniors were charged less out of pocket for
brand name drugs compared to generics that are on average four times
cheaper than the brand-named drug. This happens because drug makers pay
a rebate to the Part D plans in order to give the more expensive drug
better treatment than a generic. As a result, Medicare spending
increases due to the current structure of the Part D benefit.
Has your company ever paid a rebate to a Part D plan so that a
brand name drug would get preferential treatment (i.e., lower cost-
sharing or less utilization management) compared to a cheaper generic?
If so, please provide: a list of the drugs for which your company
has done this since January 1, 2014; and the number of Part D plans in
which this type of rebate was given for each drug in each year.
Answer. In negotiations with PBMs and payers, Janssen may offer
multiple different rebate options. The PBM or payer has sole discretion
over how formularies are structured. In some cases, a PBM or payer may
establish a formulary that puts a branded drug in a preferential
position.
The information requested is confidential and competitively
sensitive. As such, potentially responsive information is not available
for public disclosure.
net prices
Question. Your testimony stated that ``while our 2018 aggregate
list price increase was 6.3 percent, for the second year in a row
discounts and rebates outweighed that increase, and aggregate net
price--in other words, the real price--decreased by 6.8 percent.''
According to your testimony, the net price ``represents the year-over-
year change in the average net price, which is WAC less rebates,
discounts, and returns.'' Please describe how the company's year-over-
year aggregate net price is calculated. Please also specifically
address the following questions:
Answer. Average net price change represents the year-over-year
change in the average net price, which is Wholesale Acquisition Cost
less rebates, discounts, and returns.
Question. How many products are included in the calculation of the
average net price change? What was the median net price change?
Answer. We believe weighted average net price change is the
appropriate metric for evaluating list price changes across the
portfolio. There are 99 products (brands) included in the average net
price change calculation. The 2017-2018 weighted average net price
change is -6.8 percent. The non-weighted average 2017-2018 net price
change is -3.7 percent. The 2017-2018 median net price change is -1.9
percent. It is important to note that non-weighted average or median
net price change treats all medicines--whether used by many patients or
by very few--equally, so those figures are not useful or valuable in
understanding the actual change experienced.
Question. Is net price weighted? If so, how? For example, in
determining the aggregate net price does the company assign different
weights to different products based on volume or other factors? Are
``on patent'' and ``off patent'' drugs weighted identically? Are other
statistical weights used or are all products treated equally?
Answer. Annual net price change versus prior year is calculated at
the product level and weighted across the company's U.S. product
portfolio using net trade sales. All products, both ``on patent'' and
``off patent,'' are included.
Question. Does the figure that you provided during your testimony
account for U.S. prices, international prices, or both? Generally
speaking, when your company reports net price changes, does it
differentiate between U.S. and international prices?
Answer. The figure provided, -6.8 percent, accounts for 2018 net
price change for our U.S. pharmaceutical business only. We disclose
this figure in our annual Janssen U.S. Transparency Report.
Question. Please list the five drugs your company sold in the U.S.
that had the greatest year-over-year net price increase in 2018, noting
the increase for each drug by dollar figure and percentage. Please list
the five drugs your company sold in the U.S. that had the lowest year-
over-year net price increase (and/or the greatest decrease) in 2018,
noting the increase (or decrease) for each drug by dollar figure and
percentage.
Answer. The information requested is confidential and competitively
sensitive. As such, potentially responsive information is not available
for public disclosure.
Question. For 2018, what was the average net price change in the
U.S. market for (1) drugs with no competition, (2) drugs with only
branded competition, and (3) drugs with generic competition?
Answer. The information requested is confidential and competitively
sensitive. As such, potentially responsive information is not available
for public disclosure.
Question. Your company noted in its annual financial filing with
the Securities and Exchange Commission that ``Immunology was negatively
impacted by lower sales of REMICADE' (infliximab) due to
increased discounts/rebates and biosimilar competition,'' and ``Strong
sales of long-acting injectables INVEGA TRINZA'/
TREVICTA' (paliperidone palmitate) and INVEGA
SUSTENNA'/XEPLION' were partially offset by
cannibalization of RISPERDAL CONSTA' (risperidone) and
generic competition for CONCERTA'/methylphenidate,'' and
``Lower sales of INVOKANA'/INVOKAMET'
(canagliflozin) in the U.S. was primarily due to an increase in price
discounts, higher rebates and market share decline driven by
competitive pressure. Lower sales of XARELTO' (rivaroxaban)
were driven by an increase in discounts and rebates, partially offset
by an increase in market share.'' What were the year-over-year net
price changes for each of these drugs?
Answer. The information requested is confidential and competitively
sensitive. As such, potentially responsive information is not available
for public disclosure.
Question. Please define the following terms that were used on page
20 of your company's annual report for the year ending December 31,
2018 regarding sales of various pharmaceutical products: strong uptake,
market growth, and share gain. Please also define ``reduction in
sales,'' as used in the sentence ``Biosimilar versions of
REMICADE' have been introduced in certain markets outside
the U.S., resulting in a reduction in sales of REMICADE' in
those markets.''
Answer. ``Strong uptake'' means that we are seeing significant
utilization of a medicine that was recently introduced into the market
or approved for a new indication.
``Market growth'' refers to increase in utilization of medicines
overall for a particular disease state or in a particular class of
medicines.
``Share gain'' means that within a class of medicines or
therapeutic area, a particular medicine is being selected and utilized
more than it had been previously and now represents a greater
percentage of utilization within that class relative to competitor
medicines.
``Reduction in sales'' in the sentence you reference means that
revenues for REMICADE' are lower than they have been in
previous years. Please note that our 2018 Annual Report goes on to
state, ``In the U.S., a biosimilar version of REMICADE' was
introduced in 2016, and additional competitors continue to enter the
market. Continued infliximab biosimilar competition in the U.S. market
will result in a further reduction in U.S. sales of
REMICADE'.''

Questions Submitted by Hon. Robert Menendez
Question. During the hearing, when I asked whether your company
engaged in tactics to delay generic production of your products, you
answered ``no.'' However, your Johnson & Johnson's Actelion appears on
the FDA's list of companies who have access complaints against them.
Can you explain the discrepancy between your answer and the FDA list?
The FDA list can be found here: https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/
DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/
ApprovalApplications/AbbreviatedNewDrugApplicationANDAGenerics/
ucm607738.htm.
Answer. Johnson & Johnson acquired Actelion in June 2017. We share
FDA's commitment to policies that promote access to generics when
balanced with the protection of innovation and the safeguarding of
patient safety. It is important to note that the FDA's website on
Reference Listed Drug (``RLD'') Access Inquiries does not differentiate
between inquiries and complaints, and does not clarify whether the RLD
Sponsor made samples available after the FDA issued a Safety
Determination Letter. Following the receipt of a Safety Determination
Letter from the FDA, Actelion has actively entered into a supply
agreement with every generic manufacturer who has requested testing
samples of our products. This is true for each instance cited in the
FDA's RLD Access Inquiry list. Actelion is also actively engaging with
generic manufacturers to develop shared REMS programs that protect
patient safety while enabling patient access to our medicines.
Question. When new products enter the market, do drug companies set
high initial rebates and then provide deep rebates in order to gain
access to insurance plan's formularies?
Answer. At Janssen, we take a responsible approach to pricing that
recognizes our dual responsibility to patients today and patients
tomorrow. Patients today need access to our medicines. Patients
tomorrow count on us to deliver cures and treatments for the most
challenging, intractable diseases. When we set an initial list price
for our medicines, we balance:

Value to patients, the health-care system, and society.
We consider how the medicine will improve
patient health. We also assess the medicine's potential to
reduce other costs--surgeries, hospital stays, or long-term
care, for example--and the improvement the medicine represents
over the existing standard of care.

The importance of maintaining affordable access to medicines
for people who need them.
We work with insurers, pharmacy benefits
managers, governments, hospitals, physicians, and other
providers of care so that patients who are prescribed our
medicines can get access to them.

The importance of preserving our ability to develop future
groundbreaking cures and treatments.
We have an obligation to ensure that the sale
of our medicines provides us with the resources to invest in
R&D to address serious, unmet medical needs.
We go through a lengthy process to gather the information necessary
to assess the medicine according to these factors. We use this
information to determine the value of our medicine compared to what is,
or will be, available to treat the same condition--be it other
medicines, surgery, or other forms of health care.
Question. If CMS finalizes the rebate rule, do you anticipate
future products entering the market with significantly lower initial
list prices?
Answer. Depending on whether elimination of rebates applies to the
entire market or only to those related to Federal health plans and
assuming rebates are not replaced by high fees or other costs that
offset the amount saved, we expect to lower list prices or offer
discounts for pass-through at the point of sale. In either case, we
would need to renegotiate our agreements with customers.
The degree to which we can convert current rebates to list price
reductions or point-of-sale discounts will depend upon the details of
the final regulation and the reactions of other stakeholders in the
supply chain. We are concerned that PBMs may seek to replace rebate
revenue with new and increasing fees or may seek to shift costs among
supply chain participants through service fees.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Thomas R. Carper
Question. What are your recommendations for lowering prices for the
40 percent of drugs that do not offer rebates in Medicare Part D? In
the health insurance plans that you offer your employees, do you ask
your insurers to pass through the full manufacturer rebates to the
beneficiaries?
Answer. Drugs that offer lower rebates tend to be drugs that face
less competition in the marketplace. Increased competition can lead to
lower prices of branded and generic drugs. FDA Commissioner Scott
Gottlieb prioritized faster approval of generic drugs. In 2018, FDA set
a record by approving an estimated 971 generic drugs.
Within today's health-care system, we do recover manufacturer
rebates from our PBM. Any savings we receive are used to offset out-of-
pocket costs for employees and total plan costs. In order to help
ensure affordability for our employees, we limit out-of-pocket pharmacy
costs through a monthly per prescription cap.
Question. The systems for pricing and distributing drugs are opaque
and difficult to understand. What are your recommendations for
increasing transparency in how your companies set the list prices for
drugs, and for improving transparency in the supply chain for
prescription drugs? Would you support federal standards for
transparency in setting the list prices for drugs?
Answer. At Janssen, we issue an annual U.S. Transparency Report
that explains what we take into account in setting list prices for our
medicines. When we set an initial list price for our medicines, we
balance:

Value to patients, the health-care system, and society.
We consider how the medicine will improve
patient health. We also assess the medicine's potential to
reduce other costs-- surgeries, hospital stays, or long-term
care, for example--and the improvement the medicine represents
over the existing standard of care.

The importance of maintaining affordable access to medicines
for people who need them.
We work with insurers, pharmacy benefits
managers, governments, hospitals, physicians, and other
providers of care so that patients who are prescribed our
medicines can get access to them.

The importance of preserving our ability to develop future
groundbreaking cures and treatments.
We have an obligation to ensure that the sale
of our medicines provides us with the resources to invest in
R&D to address serious, unmet medical needs.
The list price we set is a publicly available figure that can be--
and is-- compared to other options available. We believe that a point-
of-sale discount model will make price reductions offered by the
manufacturer more transparent because these discounts will be directly
reflected in patient out-ofpocket cost at the pharmacy. However, we do
not believe that the proposal will improve transparency with respect to
fees or mark-ups to the price of drugs added elsewhere in the supply
chain.
Transparency that is meaningful and valuable to patients can help
achieve what we all want: better health care, at more manageable cost,
and, most importantly, longer, healthier lives for all.
We believe an environment that encourages medical innovation and
robust competition to deliver the best health outcomes is essential to
achieving these goals. Our support for legislation that establishes a
federal standard for transparency in setting the list price for drugs
would depend on the extent to which the proposed standards maintained
such an environment.
Question. In nearly every sector of the health-care industry,
Medicare, Medicaid, employers, and insurers are moving away from fee-
for-service payments to reimbursements based on value and performance.
Prescription drugs and medical devices were the glaring exceptions to
this trend until recently. How many of your drugs are included in
value-based contracts and how many patients are benefiting from them?
How do these value-based contracts work to lower drug prices for both
patients and taxpayers?
Answer. We have established several innovative, value-based
contracts with insurers and continue to explore new opportunities. For
example, in immunology, we partnered with payers to create an agreement
in which the price of a medicine for chronic immune conditions varies
based on how well it works for patients. In oncology, we partnered with
public and private payers on novel contracts for patients with prostate
cancer and agreed in one contract to provide additional rebates to the
insurer for plan members who meet eligibility criteria and whose
treatment duration is shorter than a predetermined period of time. We
also partnered with a leading payer on a contract under which we are
paid more if data show our medicine that treats adults with type 2
diabetes contributed to lowering other identified health-care costs,
such as the use of additional medicines.
Question. Last year, Senator Portman and I did an investigation on
the pricing of an opioid overdose reversal drug called EVZIO,
manufactured by Kaleo. Kaleo increased the price of EVZIO from $575 in
2014 to $4,100 in 2017. We found that the best price Medicare was able
to get for EVZIO, about $4,000, was much higher than the price other
Federal programs and private insurers were able to get. It seemed that
Kaleo was able to get this higher price of $4,000 from Medicare by
helping doctors fill out paperwork showing that the drug was medically
necessary, even though there are cheaper alternatives on the market. As
a result of the investigation, Kaleo announced it will bring a generic
version of the drug to market at only $168 per pack. Are any of your
companies providing medical necessity paperwork to doctors in order to
get your drugs covered by Medicare?
Answer. Like other pharmaceutical companies, we offer a sample
letter of medical necessity that offices can complete using their own
clinical judgment regarding the medical and clinical rationale for
submission to the insurance company or PBM. We also research and
provide payer-specific forms required to provide medical necessity
information such as payer-specific prior authorization forms.
Question. In 2017, the Rand Corporation estimated that biosimilar
drugs, which are competitors to complex, biologic drugs, could save the
United States more than $50 billion over the next decade. Some of you
have also argued that increasing the use of biosimilar drugs would help
lower drugs costs for consumers and taxpayers. What is delaying the
uptake of biosimilar drugs in the United States? What policies do you
recommend to increase the development of biosimilar drugs?
Answer. The goal of biosimilar policy should be to lower costs for
the health-care system and patients, and not simply to encourage
biosimilar uptake without regard to price. The current open and
competitive environment supports price competition and biosimilar
uptake as appropriate. For example, the net price of infliximab
products, including the innovator product REMICADE', is
falling. Furthermore, the uptake of infliximab biosimilars in the U.S.
is consistent with branded biologic launches of immunology products,
including those that provide a clinical benefit over the standard of
care.
Biologics are used in patients with serious, chronic conditions,
many of whom have taken years to become stable on a branded product.
Health-care providers and patients may naturally be hesitant to switch
medicines in these circumstances. The approval of an interchangeable
biosimilar may address some of the physician and patient reservations
about switching a stable patient to a non-interchangeable biosimilar.
The biosimilars pipeline is strong and a diverse group of
companies--traditional pharmaceutical manufacturers as well as
manufacturers focused on biosimilars--is investing in the space. For
example, in the immunology therapeutic area alone, at least 18
biosimilars are currently in clinical development or undergoing FDA
review.
We fully support a regulatory framework for FDA review and approval
of biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars with standards and
policies that are science-based and rooted in patient safety.
Ultimately, the uptake of biosimilars will be reliant on competitive
pricing and on patient and prescriber confidence. Provider and patient
confidence can be strengthened by the application of rigorous review
standards, including the robust approach to interchangeability that FDA
is pursuing and appropriate standards regarding biosimilar to
biosimilar switching.
Biosimilar manufacturers need access to samples of reference
products to perform comparative testing required to demonstrate
biosimilarity or interchangeability. We cooperate with manufacturers of
generic drugs and biosimilars so they have access to samples of our
medicines at reasonable, market-based prices. To facilitate access to
product samples while fostering efficiencies in the delivery and
oversight of healthcare, we believe that manufacturers should identify
for FDA a point of contact to facilitate access to samples for each
approved reference product. When a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategy (REMS) is in place, the REMS should facilitate the safe use of
medicine and ensure access for appropriate patients; it should not be
used to hinder provision of product samples for use in developing a
generic or biosimilar. We believe FDA should finalize draft guidance,
issued December 2018, describing a process for FDA determination that
protocols pertaining to biosimilarity and interchangeability testing
contain safety protections comparable to an applicable REMS with
limited distribution elements. A letter from FDA stating comparable
protections exist and indicating FDA would not consider it to be a
violation of the REMS to provide samples to the biosimilar manufacturer
provides needed assurances for reference product manufacturers about
both the safe use of our products and regulatory compliance.
The Purple Book is an essential resource for many stakeholders and
should be enhanced to provide timely information to stakeholders, to
clarify practices regarding substitution, and to provide information to
assure the appropriate use of biosimilars and interchangeable products.
In addition, the Purple Book should include detailed information about
approved biosimilars and interchangeable biosimilars, including, for
example, a description or listing of pivotal clinical trials considered
in FDA's approval of the biosimilar.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Benjamin L. Cardin
Question. The United States is one of the only countries in the
world to allow prescription drug manufacturers to advertise directly to
consumers through magazines, billboards, radio, and television
commercials. While I will not argue that it is beneficial to educate
consumers about an unfamiliar disease and encourage them to seek
medical help, most commercials from all of your companies recommend
asking about a specific brand name drug, not a medical condition.
Furthermore, even if your advertisements follow all FDA rules and list
medication side effects, they also almost always list these while a
smiling, apparently healthy person is walking on a beach.
Researchers say that this type of imagery, combined with viewing
hours of drug commercials each month, leads consumers to underestimate
the risks associated with medications. For the past decade, studies
have shown that aggressive direct-to-consumer advertising is associated
with rising drug prices and an increase in inappropriate drug
prescriptions.
Since researchers have concluded that consumers are
misunderstanding the benefits and risks described in your ads, what
further policies could help you and your colleagues ensure that you are
educating patients in a clear manner?
Answer. At Janssen, we believe patients can get and stay healthier
when they are well informed about their conditions and treatment
options. We provide accurate, up-to-date educational materials in
language that is clear and understandable for consumers to help
patients facing diseases our medicines treat and to help patients who
take our medicines understand how to use them properly. Our product-
specific communications, including our DTC advertising, are designed to
encourage appropriate dialogue between patients and healthcare
providers about the risks and benefits of treatment.
We believe acting ethically and responsibly is not only the right
thing to do but also the right way to do business. We follow all
relevant laws and regulations regarding the promotion of prescription
drug products and submit promotional materials to the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration at the time of initial publication or
dissemination.
We are always open to ways to improve our communication, including
DTC, to ensure patients better understand the benefits and risks of our
medicines.
pharmaceutical companies continue to raise prices
Question. As you are well aware, high prescription drug prices are
the number one concern for Americans and their families. According to
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, the average
American spends around $1,208 annually on prescription drugs. There
have been several instances where brand name or even generic drugs that
have been on the market for years continue to increase in price.
One of the most well-known examples is Mylan's increase of the
price of EpiPen from less than $100 in 2007 to more than $600 in 2016.
Another example, is the ever-increasing price of insulin. Sanofi
increased the price of a vial of Lantus from $88.20 in 2007 to $307.20
in 2017. And those are just a small sample of price increases.
Why don't we see price decreases for drugs that have been on the
market for years without new formulations or added benefit?
Answer. In fact, net price does often decrease, sometimes quite
significantly, for medicines that have been on the market for years
because of competition from other, newer medicines for the same
condition. Competition brings down price for payers such as PBMs and
insurers, although unfortunately patients often do not benefit from the
lower net price.
It is also important to note that biopharmaceutical innovation
paves the way for the introduction of generic medicines, which enables
medicine costs to be reduced over time. In the U.S., medicines lose
patent protection, on average, about 12 years after they are
introduced. When that happens, prices generally drop significantly,
giving patients ongoing access to effective therapies at a lower cost.
pay for delay
Question. Pay for delay is a tactic that more and more branded drug
manufacturers have been using to stifle competition from lower-cost
generic manufacturers. This allows you to sidestep competition by
offering patent settlements that pay generic companies not to bring
lower-cost alternatives to market.
These pay-for-delay patent settlements benefit both brand-name
pharmaceutical companies by helping them avoid costly patent litigation
and general manufacturers by rewarding them a hefty sum to delay
entering the market with a cheaper drug alternative. However, these
deals do not benefit consumers. According to an FTC study, these
anticompetitive deals cost consumers and taxpayers $3.5 billion in
higher drug costs every year.
Does your company partake in pay-for-delay settlements?
Answer. We have not entered into patent settlement agreements that
require payment of money to a generic manufacturer.
Question. Why would a pharmaceutical company enter into a pay-for
delay agreement?
Answer. We have not entered into patent settlement agreements that
require payment of money to a generic manufacturer and, therefore, we
cannot speculate as to why other companies might enter into such
agreements in specific cases.
Question. Do you think these agreements stifle competition and
prevent generic alternatives to your branded medications?
Answer. We have not entered into patent settlement agreements that
require payment of money to a generic manufacturer, so we do not have
direct experience with their competitive impacts. However, we believe
that the competitive impact of any individual settlement agreement must
be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. The current legal framework--FTC
oversight and judicial review on a case-by-case basis--is intended to
identify any patent settlement that is anti-competitive.
drug rebate rule
Question. In January, the Department of Health and Human Services'
(HHS) Office of Inspector General (OIG) promulgated a new regulation to
remove regulatory safe harbor protections under the Anti-Kickback
Statute (AKS) for rebates on prescription drugs rebates paid by
manufactures to PBMs under Medicare Part D and for Medicaid managed
care organizations (MCOs). The OIG proposal attempts to ban most
rebates by eliminating their regulatory protections.
The rule is predicted to increase net drug costs in its early
years. The CMS actuaries estimate it would cost $196 billion over 10
years. Despite this high price tag, the beneficiary benefits are
limited. The proposed rule notes that under the CMS Actuary's analysis,
the majority of beneficiaries would see an increase in their total out-
of-pocket payments and premium costs; reductions in total cost sharing
will exceed total premium increases.
I wanted to ask a question about the administration's rebate rule,
which I understand that many of the drug manufacturers, and your main
trade association, strongly support. According to an analysis of the
rule by the Office of Actuaries at CMS, drug manufacturers are likely
to initially retain 15 percent of the current rebates as higher net
drug prices.
Given that estimate, can you provide the committee with any
assurances that prices will not increase under this proposed rule?
Answer. Depending on whether elimination of rebates applies to the
entire market or only to those related to Federal health plans and
assuming rebates are not replaced by high fees or other costs that
offset the amount saved, we expect to lower list prices or offer
discounts for pass-through at the point of sale. In either case, we
would need to renegotiate our agreements with customers.
The degree to which we can convert current rebates to list price
reductions or point-of-sale discounts will depend upon the details of
the final regulation and the reactions of other stakeholders in the
supply chain. We are concerned that PBMs may seek to replace rebate
revenue with new and increasing fees or may seek to shift costs among
supply chain participants through service fees.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sherrod Brown
Question. As I understand it, 2 years ago PhRMA updated its
membership standards to require member companies to meet two new
criteria: (1) each company must meet a 3-year average global research
and development to sales ratio of 10 percent or greater, and (2) each
company must spend at least $200 million on R&D per year over a 3-year
average. As a result of these changes, several companies who continue
to operate under business models that prioritize price gouging over
innovation, left PhRMA.
Given your company's role in setting a higher standard for R&D,
would you support a more even playing field by raising the minimum bar
for R&D across the entire pharmaceutical sector, in particular for
companies that participate in government programs such as Medicare and
Medicaid?
Answer. We are proud to set a high standard for R&D investment. In
2018 Janssen invested $8.4 billion globally in research and
development. This investment in R&D was 86 percent more than we spent
on sales and marketing. However, we would not support a policy that
requires a certain amount of R&D spending for a manufacturer's products
to be covered by Medicare and Medicaid because we would not want to
deny patients access to needed medication based on the investment
decisions of these drug companies.
Question. According to an article recently published in the Journal
of the American Medical Association, medical marketers spend nearly $30
billion dollars in 2016, up from $17 billion in 1997. Direct-to-
Consumer (DTC) advertising had the biggest percentage increase: from
$2.1 billion, or 11.9% of all medical marketing, in 1997 to $9.6
billion, or 32% of total spending, in 2016.
Can you please provide what your ratio of spending on sales and
marketing to research and development is today?
Answer. In 2018, the pharmaceutical segment of Johnson & Johnson
invested 86 percent more in R&D globally ($8.4B) than we spent on
global sales and marketing ($4.5B).
price-gouging
Question. Sanofi, as I understand it, has made a pledge to the
public to limit its price increases to the national health expenditures
growth projection.
Would your company commit to a cap on annual price increases as
part of your PhRMA membership criteria?
Answer. In 1993, the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association (PMA,
now the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA)
asked the Department of Justice (``DOJ'') Antitrust Division to review
a proposal for a PMA effort to ask member companies to commit
voluntarily to limiting price increases on their entire line of
prescription medicines in any calendar year to an amount not to exceed
the increase in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). In its response, the
DOJ Antitrust Division stated that, ``[T]he Department believes that
the proposed program would violate the antitrust laws. . . . The
Supreme Court has. . . made clear that agreements that set maximum
prices are as equally illegal as agreements that set minimum prices.''
The DOJ noted that it ``intends to bring suit to challenge the program
if PMA and its members go forward with this proposal.'' Therefore, we
are unable to commit to such a cap as part of PhRMA membership
requirements due to likely enforcement action by the DOJ.
Question. What policies would you propose to help ensure lower
launch prices for new drugs?
Answer. We support rebate reforms that ensure patients benefit from
negotiated rebates and discounts--$150 billion in 2017 alone--and, as a
result, have patients see lower out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy.
Depending on whether elimination of rebates applies to the entire
market or only to those related to Federal health plans and assuming
rebates are not replaced by high fees or other costs that offset the
amount saved, we expect to lower list prices or offer discounts for
pass-through at the point of sale. In either case, we would need to
renegotiate our agreements with customers.
The degree to which we can convert current rebates to list price
reductions or point-of-sale discounts will depend upon the details of
the final regulation and the reactions of other stakeholders in the
supply chain. We are concerned that PBMs may seek to replace rebate
revenue with new and increasing fees or may seek to shift costs among
supply chain participants through service fees.
transparency
Question. In many of your testimonies, you mentioned that the
current system of pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) back-end rebates do
not rarely results in a scenario where the PBM passes on savings to
consumers at the point of sale (POS). The administration recently
proposed a rule to eliminate the anti-kickback statute safe harbor
protections for these drug rebates.
Do you agree that greater transparency should be required to
understand how manufacturers and PBMs are negotiating prices and
rebates to ensure that savings are passed down to beneficiaries?
Answer. We believe that a point-of-sale discount model will make
price reductions offered by the manufacturer more transparent because
these discounts will be directly reflected in patient out-of-pocket
cost at the pharmacy. However, we do not believe that the proposal will
improve transparency with respect to fees or mark-ups to the price of
drugs added elsewhere in the supply chain.
Depending on whether elimination of rebates applies to the entire
market or only to those related to Federal health plans and assuming
rebates are not replaced by high fees or other costs that offset the
amount saved, we expect to lower list prices or offer discounts for
pass-through at the point of sale.
pbms
Question. An Axios article from March 7, 2019 highlights the fact
that, while ``pharmaceutical companies put a lot of the blame for high
drug prices on pharmacy benefit managers,'' many large pharmaceutical
companies ``rely on PBMs to manage their own health-care benefits.''
In your role as an employer, does your company contract with a
pharmaceutical benefit manager (PBM) to administer the prescription
drug benefits for your employees and negotiate lower drug costs on your
behalf?
Answer. As an employer, we design our own pharmacy benefit program
and contract with a PBM for administration and to negotiate on our
behalf.
Question. For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the
prescription drug benefit for your employees, how do you utilize the
rebates your PBM negotiates to lower health-care costs or drug costs
for your employee plans and what does your company do with that
savings? Specifically, do the savings go toward lowing premiums?
Answer. We use any savings to offset total plan costs, enhance
benefits, and lower premium and out-of-pocket costs for our employees.
In order to ensure our employees have affordable access to medicine, we
have a monthly per prescription out-of-pocket cap.
Question. For those of you who do use a PBM to help manage the
prescription drug benefit for your employees, does your PBM offer
point-of-sale rebates to your employees?
Answer. We are exploring the possibility of offering point-of-sale
rebates with our PBM.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Sheldon Whitehouse
Question. Please describe any policy changes you support that would
result in your company lowering the list prices of its drugs.
Answer. We support rebate reforms that ensure patients benefit from
negotiated rebates and discounts-- $150 billion in 2017 alone--and, as
a result, have patients see lower out-of-pocket costs at the pharmacy.
Depending on whether elimination of rebates applies to the entire
market or only to those related to Federal health plans and assuming
rebates are not replaced by high fees or other costs that offset the
amount saved, we expect to lower list prices or offer discounts for

the final regulation and the reactions of other stakeholders in the
supply chain. We are concerned that PBMs may seek to replace rebate
revenue with new and increasing fees or may seek to shift costs among
supply chain participants through service fees.
Question. How much does your company's research and development
portfolio rely on taxpayer-funded research conducted by the National
Institutes of Health (NIH)? How many of your company's products are
based, at least in part, on NIH research, and how many are the result
of research funded solely by your company?
Answer. The NIH plays an important role in medical research,
primarily funding basic research on medical problems. The
pharmaceutical industry is responsible for developing the solutions--
undertaking the long, financially risky, and costly process to discover
a compound and develop new medicines that meet the stringent safety and
efficacy requirements of the FDA. In those instances where NIH
contributes to a product that is brought to market, NIH would receive
any contracted license fees or royalties.
Question. In each of the last 5 years, how much has your company
spent on research and development versus the advertising and marketing
of your products?
Answer. Below is a chart including global Janssen R&D and Sales and
Marketing expenditures over the last 5 years. Sales and marketing
includes expenses related to: (1) selling, (2) marketing management,
(3) market and consumer research, and (4) advertising and promotion.

Question. During the hearing, you mentioned that your company would
be likely to lower the list prices of its drugs if the recent proposal
by the Trump administration to change the current system of rebates was
extended to the private market.
If the policy was extended to the private market, how large would
the list price reductions be relative to the size of the rebates your
company is currently providing?
How will this proposal affect how your company sets the list prices
for new drug products?
Answer. Depending on whether elimination of rebates applies to the
entire market or only to those related to Federal health plans and
assuming rebates are not replaced by high fees or other costs that
offset the amount saved, we expect to lower list prices or offer
discounts for pass-through at the point of sale. In either case, we
would need to renegotiate our agreements with customers.
The degree to which we can convert current rebates to list price
reductions or point-ofsale discounts will depend upon the details of
the final regulation and the reactions of other stakeholders in the
supply chain. We are concerned that PBMs may seek to replace rebate
revenue with new and increasing fees or may seek to shift costs among
supply chain participants through service fees.
Question. If the proposal is finalized and not extended to the
private market, will your company make any list price reductions? If
so, how large would the reductions be relative to the size of the
rebates your company is currently providing?
Answer. If elimination of rebates applies only to Medicare and
Medicaid Managed Care and assuming rebates are not replaced by high
fees or other costs that offset the amount saved, we expect to offer
discounts for pass-through at the point of sale. To do so, we would
need to renegotiate our agreements with customers.

______
Question Submitted by Hon. Maggie Hassan
Question. In June of 2018, the Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access
Commission (MACPAC) unanimously recommended under Recommendation 1.1 in
their annual report to Congress that Congress remove the statutory
requirement that manufacturers blend the average manufacturer price
(AMP) of a brand drug and its authorized generic.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ MACPAC, ``Improving Operations of the Medicaid Drug Rebate
Program,'' https://www.macpac.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Improving-
Operations-of-the-Medicaid-Drug-Rebate-Program.pdf.
This requirement created an unintended loophole. Rather than use
the price of the authorized generic, drug companies can sell its
authorized generic to a corporate subsidiary at an artificially lower
price, and use that lower price to bring down the AMP, which in turn
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
lowers the rebate obligation.
Does your company engage in this practice? Has your company ever
engaged in this practice in the past?
Answer. We do not include authorized generic internal transfer
prices to an affiliate when calculating Average Manufacturer Price for
the branded product. Under previous versions of the statute and CMS
guidance, we have at times in the past included in Average Manufacturer
Price the transfer prices of our authorized generic sold to an
affiliate.

Questions Submitted by Hon. Catherine Cortez Masto
Question. As a portion of your revenue, for what percentage of the
drugs in your portfolio do you offer no rebates? Based on the drugs in
your pipeline, do you foresee that portion growing? For those drugs is
your list price equal to your net price?
Answer. The information requested is confidential and competitively
sensitive. As such, potentially responsive information is not available
for public disclosure.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you generate in US sales
revenue? Please include specific figures.
Answer. Janssen is one of the world's top R&D investors in any
industry, anywhere in the world. In 2018 we invested $8.4 billion in
pharmaceutical R&D globally. Our pharmaceutical revenue in the U.S. was
$23.3 billion. We invested 86 percent more in pharmaceutical R&D ($8.4
billion) than we spent on pharmaceutical global sales and marketing
($4.5 billion).
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
administration? What company functions do you consider to be included
in administration? Please include specific figures.
Answer. Johnson & Johnson is comprised of three business segments:
pharmaceuticals (Janssen), medical devices, and consumer products. In
its financial statements, Johnson & Johnson reports a global total
figure across all segments for Sales, Marketing and Administration
(``SM&A''). This figure combines marketing, sales, and administrative
expenses such as insurance, legal, finance, and product distribution.
In 2018, that global, cross-sector SM&A expenditure was $22.54 billion.
The total global, cross-sector R&D investment by J&J in 2018 was $10.78
billion.
Johnson & Johnson does not report SM&A by business segment.
Janssen, the pharmaceutical segment of J&J, invested $8.4 billion in
R&D globally in 2018 and spent $4.5 billion on marketing and sales
globally.
Question. Do you invest more in R&D than you spend on marketing and
sales? What company functions do you consider to be included in sales?
Please include specific figures.
Answer. In 2018, we invested 86 percent more in pharmaceutical R&D
($8.4 billion) than we spent on pharmaceutical global sales and
marketing ($4.5 billion). Sales and marketing includes: (1) our
expenses related to selling, (2) marketing management, (3) market and
consumer research, and (4) advertising and promotion.
Question. Why do you advertise for the drugs you manufacture? What
factors do you consider in choosing which drugs you advertise?
Answer. We believe direct-to-consumer communication, including
advertising, can empower patients with information to help them have
appropriate discussions with their healthcare providers, including
dialogue about the risks and benefits of treatment. We provide
accurate, up-to-date educational materials to help patients facing
diseases our medicines treat and to help patients who take our
medicines understand how to use them properly.
We believe acting ethically and responsibly is not only the right
thing to do but also the right way to do business. We follow all
relevant laws and regulations regarding the promotion of prescription
drug products and submit promotional materials to the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration at the time of initial publication or
dissemination.
We work to communicate in ways that will be most valuable in
empowering patients to have appropriate dialogue with their healthcare
providers.
We consider the availability of information and awareness of
treatment options. We build a communication plan that can include a
variety of channels, with direct-to-consumer advertising being one
channel among many we may use.

Janssen has also made financial donations to independent charitable
foundations that assist patients who are underinsured and in financial
need with treatment-related expenses. In keeping with our donor
agreements and applicable regulatory guidance, we will only disclose
aggregate data on our charitable giving and do not publicize
information on donations to specific foundations and disease states.
In 2014, we contributed approximately $40 million in donations to
independent charitable foundations, enabling them to provide
assistance with medication-related copays to patients with cancer
diseases.

Janssen has also made financial donations to independent charitable
foundations that assist patients who are underinsured and in financial
need with treatment-related expenses. In keeping with our donor
agreements and applicable regulatory guidance, we will only disclose
aggregate data on our charitable giving and do not publicize
information on donations to specific foundations and disease states.
In 2014, we contributed approximately $5.8 million in donations to
independent charitable foundations, enabling them to provide
assistance with medication-related copays to patients with infectious
diseases.

Janssen has also made financial donations to independent charitable
foundations that assist patients who are underinsured and in financial
need with treatment-related expenses. In keeping with our donor
agreements and applicable regulatory guidance, we will only disclose
aggregate data on our charitable giving and do not publicize
information on donations to specific foundations and disease states.
In 2015, we contributed $29.5 million in donations to independent
charitable foundations, enabling them to provide assistance with
medication-related copays to patients with cancer and autoimmune
diseases.

Janssen has also made financial donations to independent charitable
foundations that assist patients who are underinsured and in financial
need with treatment-related expenses. In keeping with our donor
agreements and applicable regulatory guidance, we will only disclose
aggregate data on our charitable giving and do not publicize
information on donations to specific foundations and disease states.
In 2016, we contributed $47 million in donations to independent
charitable foundations, enabling them to provide assistance with
medication-related copays to patients with cancer and autoimmune
diseases.

340B is a Small Share of the Drug Market
and Does Not Increase Drug Prices
New data show drug manufacturers provided $6.1 billion in total drug
discounts in 2015 under the 340B Program. The 340B discount is less
than 2 percent of the total U.S. drug market and is dwarfed by other
segments of the drug industry.
340B does not increase drug prices. 340B reduces costs for safety net
providers, allowing them to provide affordable drugs and services to
low-income patients.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
Compared to other segments of the market, the total 340B discount is:

Less than 2 percent of total U.S. drug spending.

3.6 percent of all discounts and rebates offered by
manufacturers.

4 percent of the specialty drug spending.

89 percent less than the rebates manufacturers provide to health
plans and PBMs.

78 percent less than what manufacturers spend on advertising.

57 percent less than what brand-name manufacturers have lost
from patent expirations.
Nearly one third of the total 340B discount is due a penalty enforced
against drug manufacturers for raising the price of drugs higher than
the rate of inflation or voluntarily providing a discount lower than
the 340B price. Manufacturers could avoid this penalty by not
increasing their drug prices at such high rates.
Total 340B Discount, $6.1 Billion

Prepared Statement of Hon. Ron Wyden,
a U.S. Senator From Oregon
Prescription drugs did not become outrageously expensive by
accident. It's not the result of a system too complicated for Americans
to comprehend. Drug prices are astronomically high because that's where
pharmaceutical companies and their investors want them. The brakes have
come off pharmaceutical pricing, and American families are hurtling
along in the passenger seat terrified of what comes next.
Today the committee will hear uplifting stories about miracle
cures, but it is morally repugnant when patients can't afford them. It
is morally repugnant when ailing patients are forced to choose between
filling that next prescription or putting food on the table, because
they can't afford both. It is morally repugnant when patients are
forced to skip doses.
You Pharma executives are here because the way you do business is
unacceptable and unsustainable. Ten companies accounted for half of all
profts in the health-care sector last fall. Nine of those ten were drug
manufacturers. All but one of today's witnesses represent companies on
that list. Drug makers behave as if patients and taxpayers are unlocked
ATMs full of cash to be extracted, and their shareholders are the
customers they value above all else.
Let's look at concrete examples, starting with AbbVie. AbbVie
manufactures the top-selling prescription drug in America, the
arthritis medication Humira. Over 6 years, the company doubled the
price of a 12-month supply from $19,000 to $38,000. Can patients opt
for a less-expensive alternative? No they cannot, because AbbVie
protects the exclusivity of Humira like Gollum with his ring: thick
cobwebs of patents, legal tricks, and shadowy deals with other drug
makers, all to keep the cash flowing.
I also want to address troubling information the committee recently
uncovered. I'm holding AbbVie's proxy statement, a document every
publicly traded company must file with the SEC. Page 37 shows that in
2017, a portion of CEO Richard Gonzalez's multi-million-dollar bonus
was directly tied to sales of Humira. It appears the same incentive was
in place in 2015 and 2016.
In fact, the committee's review shows that all of AbbVie's top
executives had the same arrangement. Mr. Gonzalez is welcome to
respond, but the implication of that incentive ought to be clear. From
top down, AbbVie's leadership had reason to keep pushing prices and
sales upward.
Now on to Pfizer. Pfizer gets first prize for emptiest gesture on
pricing in 2018. After stern Trump tweets last year, Pfizer said it
would temporarily freeze prices. But once the President got his splashy
headlines, his gaze turned elsewhere, and Pfizer's former CEO told
investors it was back to ``business as normal.'' Another round of price
hikes in 2019, including on its pain medication Lyrica. Lyrica's price
has increased 163 percent since 2012. With this one drug, Pfizer raked
in $4.5 billion in 2017.
Merck: Merck gets second prize for emptiest gesture on pricing in
2018. It made sweet-sounding promises after coming under criticism, but
it cut prices for drugs that provide essentially no revenue to the
company. Left untouched were the cash cows Keytruda and Januvia, which
account for more than a quarter of Merck's revenue. It's like promising
car shoppers a great deal, except the only discounted model on the lot
is an Edsel.
Sanofi: A company wringing more and more cash out of people with an
incurable disease. In 2010, a vial of Sanofi insulin cost less than
$100. In 2018 it cost nearly $300, and the company raised prices again
in 2019. Considering that the landmark breakthrough on insulin came
early in the roaring twenties, nothing could justify that sudden price
increase nearly a century later. Diabetics who can't afford the costs
are self-rationing and endangering their lives, but at least the
investors are happy.
AstraZeneca: A lesson in saying the quiet part out loud. In an
interview earlier this year, CEO Pascal Soriot complained that his $12-
million salary made him ``the lowest-paid CEO in the whole industry.''
He said it was ``annoying to some extent.'' His company, meanwhile,
continues to raise the price of Symbicort, its $3-billion asthma drug.
For some asthmatics, being able to breathe costs hundreds of dollars a
month.
Johnson & Johnson: A record-setting flip-flop. This January 7th, at
the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference, CEO Alex Gorsky said that the
pharmaceutical industry needed to self-police on pricing. Sounds good,
but it didn't last long. Three days later, his company hiked the prices
of hundreds of its drugs, including drugs that account for billions in
Medicare spending.
Bristol-Myers-Squibb: In 2017, the company spent roughly $11.5
billion on dividends, stock buybacks, marketing, sales, and
administrative costs. That's roughly triple the amount it spent on R&D.
This is all a stark illustration of drug makers' profiteering and
two-faced scheming. The central argument that the committee will hear
in response is that the fault is everybody else's. The health plans are
at fault. The PBMs are at fault. Regulators are at fault. They always
point the finger elsewhere.
We'll also hear that list prices don't matter; that the true costs
are complicated. But companies don't set and raise list prices for fun.
Those prices are directly tied to the amount patients pay out-of-pocket
at the pharmacy window. They are directly tied to what taxpayers spend
on health-care programs.
Next, drug makers point fingers at the middlemen, pharmacy benefit
managers. I've said for years that PBMs are wasteful and secretive,
taking their cut without proving their worth to anybody. They will have
their day before this committee. But PBMs don't set list prices;
manufacturers do. Furthermore, manufacturers don't offer rebates for
nearly 40 percent of Part D brand-name drugs. Those prices continue to
rise. That's on the drug companies, not on PBMs.
Next, drug makers say changes in the status quo will hurt R&D. A
quick look at these companies' finances, on both sides of the balance
sheet, shows that isn't the case. Revenue generated from American
patients alone dwarfs what they spend on R&D worldwide. Drug makers
also spend as much, if not more, on flashy TV ads and office-to-office
salesmen as they spend on R&D. And if lower prices would diminish R&D,
why don't costly dividends? Why don't stock buybacks? Is the stock
price more important than inventing the next miracle cure?
Even if you buy the specious argument that a drug's list price at
launch is driven by the cost of R&D, what could justify arbitrary price
increases year after year, long after the R&D spending is done?
Finally, companies say they help patients afford drugs with
``coupons`` or patient assistance programs. But if these programs are
so widely generous, why can't drug makers instead simply lower prices
across the board? Because it's just more slick branding--ploys that
allow companies to maintain the status quo.
One final point. I was there when seven Big Tobacco CEOs testifed
in a committee room like this one, and they lied. The chairman and I
expect better this morning. Your profits are outsized compared to
others in the industry, you receive a massive portion of your revenue
from American taxpayers, and you bear none of the consequences of high
drug prices. It's past time to get beyond the excuses and make
prescription drugs affordable.

Dear Chairman Grassley and Ranking Member Wyden:
AARP appreciates your focus on prescription drug prices and the
challenges that increasing drug costs pose for seniors, and we thank
you for holding the hearing on February 26, 2019, to highlight rising
prescription drug prices. AARP, with its nearly 38 million members in
all 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. territories is a
nonpartisan, nonprofit, nationwide organization that helps people turn
their goals and dreams into real possibilities, strengthens communities
and fights for the issues that matter most to families such as
healthcare, employment and income security, retirement planning,
affordable utilities and protection from financial abuse.
Prescription drug prices are a high priority for AARP and all older
Americans, as older adults are particularly vulnerable to high
prescription drug prices. Medicare Part D enrollees take an average of
4.5 prescriptions per month, and over two-thirds have two or more
concurrent chronic illnesses. When older Americans talk about the
impact of high prescription drug prices, they are often talking about
costs that they will face every year for the rest of their lives.
Most Medicare beneficiaries live on modest incomes, with an annual
median of just over $26,000. One-quarter have incomes of just over
$15,000. One-quarter have less than $15,000 in savings. This is not a
population that has the resources to absorb rapidly escalating
prescription drug prices, and many are simply unable to afford the
medications they need.
Unfortunately, older Americans have seen their prescription drug prices
skyrocket in recent years. About 30 years ago, the public was outraged
over a drug that cost less than $10,000 per year. We now have drugs
with prices approaching $1 million per year.
In 2015, the average annual cost for a single specialty drug used on a
chronic basis was $52,486--which is only slightly less than the median
household income in the United States.\1\ We strongly support efforts
to bring new treatments to market, but innovation is meaningless if
patients cannot afford to use the treatment.

trends-in-retail-prices-of-specialty-prescription-druqs-widely-used-by-
older-americans.pdf.
AARP has been tracking the prices of widely-used prescription drugs
since 2004. Our most recent Rx Price Watch Report focused on brand-name
drugs and found that their retail prices increased by an average of
8.4% in 2017--four times the rate of inflation. AARP's report also
examined how drug companies' relentless price increases add up over
time and found that the average annual cost of one brand-name drug--now
around $6,800--would have been just under $2,200 in 2017 if retail
price changes had been limited to general inflation between 2006 and
2017.\2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ https://www.aarp.org/content/dam/aarp/ppi/2018/09/trends-in-
retail-prices-of-brand-name-prescription-druqs-year-end-update.pdf
The average annual price increases for brand name drugs have exceeded
the corresponding rate of inflation every year since at least 2006.
More importantly, this problem goes beyond a few bad actors: virtually
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
all of the manufacturers we track raise their prices every single year.
As a result, it is hardly surprising that our members consistently tell
us they cannot afford the medications they need and are forced to make
difficult choices as a result. Even less surprising is that they want
this situation to change. Last year, in AARP's 2018 Mid-Term Voter
Issues Survey, 92 percent of voters age 50 and older told us that
candidates' positions on lowering drug costs was important to them,
with 74 percent saying ``very important.''
Moreover, in a Kaiser 2018 Health Tracking Poll, prescription drug
prices topped the list of the public's priorities, with 90 percent
calling it an important priority, and 52 percent listing it as a ``top
priority.'' In that poll, a large majority (80 percent) of the public
reported perceiving prescription drug costs as ``unreasonable,'' a
share that has increased since 2015.
Today it seems that prescription prices are in a never-ending race to
the top. High priced specialty drug approvals have exceeded traditional
drug approvals since 2010, and the number of people using such drugs is
growing. Meanwhile, the research pipeline is full of products like
orphan drugs, biologics, and personalized medicines that face little
competition and will undoubtedly command even higher prices.
We have also seen massive increases in Medicare spending on
prescription drugs. Between 2005 and 2016, Medicare Part B drug
spending more than doubled from $12 billion to $29 billion. Total
Medicare Part D spending is approaching $150 billion. These escalating
costs will eventually result in higher taxes, cuts to vitally important
public programs, or both.
Current prescription drug price trends are simply not sustainable. High
and growing drug prices are affecting all Americans in some way. Their
cost is passed along to everyone with health coverage through increased
health care premiums, deductibles, and other forms of cost-sharing.
They are also driving larger cost increases for a variety of taxpayer-
funded programs. Meanwhile, drug companies are working very hard to try
to shift the blame to others in the health care system, leaving them
free to set incredibly high prices and increase them with little
restraint.
It is long past time for Congress to take action to rein in high drug
prices. Thoughtful bipartisan efforts to help reduce prescription drug
prices could save tens of billions of dollars for patients, taxpayers
and the U.S. health care system. More importantly, they will help
ensure that all Americans have affordable access to the drugs that they
need to get and stay healthy.
We look forward to working with this Committee to find solutions that
will lower prescription drug prices and costs for older Americans. If
you have any additional questions, feel free to contact me or have your
staff contact Amy Kelbick on our Government Affairs staff at

ASHP (American Society of Health-System Pharmacists) respectfully
submits the following statement for the record to the Senate Committee
on Finance hearing on ``Drug Pricing in America: A Prescription for
Change, Part II.''
ASHP represents pharmacists who serve as patient care providers in
acute and ambulatory settings. The organization's nearly 50,000 members
include pharmacists, student pharmacists, and pharmacy technicians. For
more than 75 years, ASHP has been at the forefront of efforts to
improve medication use and enhance patient safety.
ASHP's vision is that medication use will be optimal, safe, and
effective for all people all of the time. A primary tenet of that
vision includes access to affordable medications needed to save or
sustain lives. Addressing the issue of skyrocketing drug prices,
including excessive price increases on commonly used generic
medications, is one of ASHP's highest and longstanding public policy
priorities. According to a Kaiser Health Tracking Poll, 1 in 4
Americans cannot afford their medications.\1\ Poor access to
medications can lead to increased morbidity and mortality, and can
cause healthcare costs to increase.

2015.'' The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 20 Aug. 2015,
www.kff.org/health-costs/poll-finding/kaiser-health-tracking-poll-
august-2015/. Accessed February 10, 2019.
ASHP has been proactively addressing challenges related to the rapid
increase of prescription drug pricing on several fronts, including
working with like-minded stakeholders and educating members of Congress
about the unsustainable burdens faced by patients, healthcare
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
providers, and the entire healthcare system.
ASHP is a lead member of the Steering Committee of the Campaign for
Sustainable Rx Pricing (CSRxP), a coalition of prominent national
organizations representing physicians, consumers, payers, hospitals,
health systems, and patient advocacy groups. CSRxP has developed a
policy platform promoting market based solutions supported by three
pillars: competition, value, and transparency.
The goal of the campaign is to identify policy options that have
bipartisan support and, therefore, a greater likelihood of passage. To
that end, CSRxP focuses on policies to incentivize a more competitive
marketplace to help stimulate lower drug prices. The campaign has also
expressed support for efforts to loosen restrictions that prevent
generic drug companies from obtaining the samples necessary to
manufacture a competing product.
The price increases have placed enormous budgetary pressure on
healthcare organizations, including hospitals and health systems. ASHP,
along with the American Hospital Association (AHA) and the Federation
of American Hospitals (FAH), recently released a report on the impact
that the cost of and access to prescription drugs are having on
hospital budgets and operations.
Specifically, the report showed that:

Average total drug spending per hospital admission increased by
18.5% between fiscal years (FY) 2015 and FY2017.

Outpatient drug spending per admission increased by 28.7%, while
inpatient drug spending per admission increased by 9.6%, between FY2015
and FY2017.

Hospitals experienced price increases of over 80% across
different classes of drugs, including those for anesthetics, parenteral
solutions, and chemotherapy.

Over 90% of surveyed hospitals reported having to identify
alternative therapies to manage spending.

One in 4 hospitals had to cut staff to mitigate budget
pressures.\2\

Accessed 25 Feb. 2019.
ASHP does not collect, store, or report drug pricing information.
However, we continually hear from pharmacy leaders in hospitals and
health systems that sudden, inexplicable, and unpredictable price
increases in connection with some of the most commonly used, long
standing generic medications are becoming more prevalent--and are
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
occurring on a nationwide basis.
As there is no single solution to spikes in the prices of certain
drugs, there is no single cause either. In this statement, we address
four additional issues as they relate to drug pricing: competition,
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (REMS), Direct and Indirect
Remuneration (DIR Fees), and the 340B Drug Pricing Program.
COMPETITION
In particular, ASHP would like to learn more about the marketplace
dynamics that could contribute to this issue, as we have worked
diligently to address the issue of drug shortages for nearly 15 years.
Although drug shortages are caused by a number of factors, we have
observed that drugs in short supply made by only one or two
manufacturers often result in higher-than-normal prices. If, for
example, there is a lack of competition in the generic market place, we
urge the committee to look at ways to stimulate more marketplace
presence. ASHP supports bills such as S. 64, the ``Preserve Access to
Affordable Generics and Biosimilars Act.'' This bipartisan bill would
potentially increase competition by prohibiting companies from engaging
in ``pay-to-delay'' tactics to stifle generic and biosimilar entry into
the market.
RISK EVALUATION AND MITIGATION STRATEGY (REMS)
ASHP recognizes that there may be limited circumstances in which
constraints on the traditional drug supply system may be appropriate
for reasons of patient safety, including through the use of
manufacturer-driven REMS. However, we believe that REMS should never be
used to artificially inflate drug prices, nor should REMS interfere
with the professional practice of pharmacists, physicians, nurses, and
other providers. We believe that there may be current cases in which a
manufacturer-
driven REMS using restricted distribution is causing higher prices for
those drugs, having adverse effects on patient access, and delaying
treatment. In some cases, there may be evidence to suggest that the use
of restricted or limited distribution channels has resulted in the
inability of a potential competitor to acquire enough of a drug to
conduct the required testing to bring a generic competitor to market.
For this reason, ASHP thanks Chairman Grassley for introducing S. 340,
the ``Creating and Restoring Equal Access to Equivalent Samples
(CREATES) Act of 2019.'' The CREATES Act will help ensure that brand-
name pharmaceutical companies cannot manipulate regulatory rules to
prevent competition, which is essential for patient access to
affordable medications. Additionally, we recommend that Congress
require the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to investigate
restricted distribution under a REMS as a means to artificially
increase drug prices and limit access to critical medications.
Restricting distribution of medications is often a means to push
patients to a specific purchasing channel, which in some cases
increases not only their out-of-pocket costs, but also systemic costs.
Further, restricted distribution networks can complicate patient access
to critical medications, potentially disrupting care.
DIRECT AND INDIRECT REMUNERATION FEES (DIR FEES)
Many factors contribute to high drug product costs; addressing the
problem is made difficult by lack of transparency about the marketplace
for those products. For example, DIR fees and other rebates negotiated
by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) make it difficult to determine the
actual cost of a drug. DIR fees are a growing nationwide concern among
pharmacies that dispense medications in a community pharmacy or
outpatient clinic setting. Created under the Medicare Part D Program,
DIR fees were originally intended as a way for CMS to account for the
true cost of the drug dispensed, including any manufacturer rebates.
Often these rebates were unknown until the drug was dispensed and the
claim adjudicated. Moreover, the fees themselves, which are often
arbitrary in nature, have mushroomed over the past decade, to the point
that pharmacies regularly see annual DIR totals in the tens of
thousands of dollars.
Recently, a concerning trend has emerged in which pharmacy benefit
managers (PBMs) have begun to charge DIR fees to their pharmacy
providers. Under this scenario, PBMs are inappropriately applying their
own plan performance measures as a way to assess fees on pharmacies.
This is problematic for the following reasons:

It is an arbitrary and unintended application of quality
measures meant for total plan performance as opposed to pharmacy-level
metrics.

The quality measures applied tend to be based on maintenance
medications such as blood pressure medications or medications used to
treat diabetes. These measures were never intended to be applied to
specialty medications or to other specialized disease states such as
oncology, yet PBMs assess DIR fees against the gross reimbursement for
all prescriptions received by pharmacy providers, not just maintenance
medication s.

Pharmacy providers are essentially being penalized with backdoor
fees without any requirement that PBMs define, justify, or explain
these charges to providers and to CMS.
DIR fees assessed on pharmacies providing specialty medications have
been especially hard-hit, due to the fee structure. Fees could be a
flat rate of per dollar per claim or a percentage (typically 3-9%) of
the total reimbursement per claim. Using the percentage-based
structure, the fees would increase markedly for specialty drugs, which
are typically much more expensive than maintenance medications,
sometimes resulting in thousands of dollars. A 9% fee on a drug costing
$100,000 is $9,000. Additionally, these fees are assessed
retroactively, sometimes months after the claim has been adjudicated,
providing no recourse for the pharmacy impacted by the assessment.
The result of imposing DIR fees has led to higher cost-sharing
responsibilities for Medicare beneficiaries, which have, in turn,
caused more of these beneficiaries to enter the Part D donut hole,
where the patient is solely responsible for the cost of the drug. Along
with the higher costs absorbed by patients, adherence rates tend to be
lower among Medicare beneficiaries who are in the donut hole and may
not have the financial resources to pay for their medications. This is
in stark contrast to the very reason DIR fees targeting manufacturer
rebates were created--so that savings could be passed on to patients.
Pharmacies are not alone in their concern. In January 2017, CMS
published a fact sheet expressing concern over DIR fees and cited those
fees as contributing to increased drug costs, which, in turn, increased
patients' out-of-pocket spending and Medicare spending overall.\3\
Additionally, questions remain as to whether Part D plan sponsors have
the authority to assess these fees on pharmacies. There are no
references to DIR fees collected on pharmacies in either the Part D
statute or corresponding CMS regulations.

indirect-remuneration-dir. Accessed February 10, 2019
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
ASHP's professional policy on DIR fees is as follows:
To advocate that payers and pharmacy benefit managers be
prohibited from recovering direct and indirect remuneration
fees from pharmacies on adjudicated dispensing claims; further,
To oppose the application of plan-level quality measures on
specific providers, such as participating pharmacies.\4\

THE 340B DRUG PRICING PROGRAM
For 25 years, the federal 340B program has allowed safety-net hospitals
``to stretch scarce Federal resources as far as possible, reaching more
eligible patients and providing more comprehensive services.'' This
program has been essential to expanding access to lifesaving
prescription drugs and comprehensive healthcare services to low-income
and uninsured individuals, at no cost to the federal government. The
federal 340B program is not causing high drug prices. The program
accounts for less than 5% of annual drug purchases in the United
States, while safety-net providers give 30% of the care. There are many
contributing factors to higher drug costs, but there is no objective
evidence that the program has increased overall drug pricing. In fact,
the 340B program is revenue-neutral, benefiting patients without
increasing costs for federal payors.
The federal 340B program enables these hospitals to serve their
communities by providing vital care such as:

Free or lower-cost medications to patients.

Programs to increase medication adherence, including clinical
pharmacy services to high-risk patients who are on multiple and/or
complex medications.

Increased access to primary care.

Screenings and preventive care services to detect health
problems early and decrease morbidity and mortality, as well as to
decrease healthcare costs and hospital admissions.
The federal 340B program is at risk because of a recent change in
Medicare payment policy that reduces payment from average sales price
plus 6 percent to average sales price minus 22.5 percent. Cuts of this
magnitude undermine the intent of the program, reducing resources that
hospitals use to expand access to care and services to vulnerable
communities. Given the increasingly high cost of pharmaceuticals, the
federal 340B program provides critical support to the entities eligible
to participate in the program.
CONCLUSION
ASHP thanks the Committee on Finance for holding this important
hearing. ASHP remains committed to working with Congress and industry
stakeholders to ensure that patients have affordable access to
lifesaving and life-sustaining medications.

Coalition for Affordable Prescription Drugs
U.S. Senate
Committee on Finance
Dirksen Senate Office Bldg.
Washington, DC 20510-6200
Tuesday, February 26, 2019
The Coalition for Affordable Prescription Drugs (CAPD) appreciates the
opportunity to submit the following statement for the record.
Overview
CAPD is a diverse group of employers, unions, public sector employees
and retirees and the pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) they partner with
to provide more affordable prescription drug coverage for millions of
Americans.
Today, too many patients and families are struggling to pay for the
medications they need. It's no surprise that a recent Politico/Harvard
Chan School of Public Health poll showed that 80 percent of Americans
see high prescription drug prices as a top priority for the new
Congress and the Administration.
The Role of PBMs in Lowering Costs
In the face of rising drug prices, PBMs partner with employers, unions,
public sector retirees and other organizations who purchase health care
to help manage prescription drug coverage for millions of Americans. By
negotiating with drug companies and providing patient-centered tools to
improve care and help lower out-of-pocket costs, PBMs save over $900
per person each year.
In addition, PBMs are expanding visibility into drug prices by enabling
doctors and patients to see the price of various medicines at the point
of prescribing, based on the individual's specific drug benefits. With
this information, physicians switch to a more affordable medicine
nearly 20 percent of the time when clinically equivalent alternatives
are offered through UnitedHealth Group's RTBT, PreCheck MyScript. In
another example, CVS Health's Real Time Benefits tool has saved
patients an average of $120 to $130 per fill.
Drug Company Prices Are the Problem
Although there have been many ideas proffered about how to address the
rising prices of medicines, CAPD believes that we first need to address
the root problem: prices set by drug makers. Drug companies alone set
their prices and they are rising at an unsustainable rate. In fact,
drug companies have raised prices already in 2019 on hundreds of
medicines. And, what's worse is that this is repeat behavior. Drug
companies often raise those prices multiple times a year for the exact
same product. Over the last five years, prices increased on the top 20
most prescribed brand-name drugs for seniors by an average of 12
percent each year, which is significantly above the annual rate of
inflation. The truth is simple: Drug companies hike their prices
because they can. When they do so, millions of patients pay more at the
counter.
Drug companies, hoping to avoid scrutiny and sustain high profits, are
pointing the finger at every other industry except themselves.
According to drug companies, the reason why drug prices are so high
isn't because they keep raising prices, or abuse the patent system, or
make by far the highest profits in health care--it's everyone else's
problem, not theirs.
In today's testimony, we will likely hear a common refrain from drug
companies: part of the reason that drug prices are so high are because
of the rebates that they are forced to give to PBMs. But the problem
with this argument is that, according to a recent study, there is
little correlation between prices drug companies set for their drugs
and the rebates negotiated by PBMs across 23 major drug categories.
What's more, in Medicare Part D, even after accounting for rebates, the
costs of brand name drugs still increased 62% from 2011 to 2015.
All parties need to come to the table to make prescriptions more
affordable and accessible to the patients who need them--but nothing
will be done if pharma refuses to even pull up a chair and address the
problem where it starts: their high prices. We hope Congress will use
this hearing as an opportunity to ask the pharmaceutical industry to
answer for these increases.
Pharma's Gamesmanship Reducing Competition to Keep Prices High
One way to meaningfully lower drug prices for patients is to stop the
gamesmanship of the patent and regulatory systems that drug companies
use to maintain their monopoly pricing power and keep lower-cost
generic alternatives from entering the market.
Brand drug manufacturers exploit the FDA Risk Evaluation and Mitigation
Strategies (REMS) program to prevent generic drug makers from accessing
needed samples, costing the U.S. health care system $5.4B each year.
The CREATES Act, which passed out of the Senate Judiciary Committee
last year, is a targeted, market-based, bipartisan solution to the
longstanding problem of brand name pharmaceutical companies denying
generic manufacturers access to the samples they require to conduct
necessary equivalence testing to bring their product to market.
Another way brand drug manufacturers game the patent and regulatory
system is through ``pay-for-delay'' deals, in which drug makers engage
in anticompetitive patent settlements with potential generic
competitors, resulting in $3.58 in higher drug costs each year. In the
most high-profile example of these abuses, drug maker AbbVie last year
reached agreements with Amgen, Samsung Bioepis and Mylan to delay entry
of a lower-cost biosimilar version of the drug to 2023 in the United
States.
A third example of gamesmanship by brand drug manufacturers is
evergreening, in which generic competition is delayed by additional
patents on minor variations of the original drug for the clear purpose
of extending monopoly protection. While these tweaks often do not
convey enhanced clinical benefits to the patient, they do extend the
time period during which drug manufacturers can continue to control
pricing by preventing competition. For example, best selling drug
Humira to treat rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis is protected by over
100 patents and the product may not face any competition until as late
as 2034.
We encourage Congress to explore proposals that target patent and
regulatory abuses by drug companies in order to lower drug prices for
patients.
Conclusion
Simply put, a patient cannot be helped by a drug they cannot afford. We
ask today that Congress once and for all refuse to accept drug
manufacturers' excuses for high prices and take steps to put an end to
the patent and regulatory abuses that keep prices artificially high.
We believe the time to act is now. CAPD is committed to working with
Congress and other stakeholders on this and other solutions to
meaningfully lower prescription drug prices for all Americans. We look
forward to supporting this critical effort.

What They're Saying: Don't Let Pharma Off the Hook
On January 29, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing, ``Drug
Pricing in America: A Prescription for Change.'' During the hearing,
both Senators and witnesses discussed drug companies' high prices and
their anti-competitive actions.
DRUG COMPANIES' HIGH PRICES

Chairman Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa): ``I've also heard from seniors
who have seen their prescriptions increase month after month for no
apparent reason. And I've heard stories about people reducing their
life-saving medicines...to save money. This is unacceptable. . . . But
other drugs are creating problems as well, that is why tackling high
prescription drug costs is one of Senator Wyden's and my first priority
on this committee.''

Ranking Member Ron Wyden (D-Oregon): ``So there's no shortage of
evidence about what the problems are. The companies have unchecked
powers to set prices on their own, and often it's to meet Wall Street's
expectations rather than meet demand in the market.''

Mark Miller, The Arnold Foundation: ``The revenues that come out
of the United States exceed R&D by something like 70, 75 percent. . . .
So the first point is when people say R&D is driving these prices,
there is a big disconnect in there. . . . We found many companies in
which they're spending much more on advertising, marketing and other
administrative expenses than they are on R&D.''

Peter Bach, Memorial Sloan Kettering: ``Prices for monopoly
goods such as these are determined by the market in which they are
sold, not the other way around. . . . Please realize that these drugs
do not inherently cost $1 million any more than they inherently cost
$1.''

Kathy Sego, mother of a child with diabetes: ``As a mother, I
would probably say to them--I hope you know that there are people who
are going without their medication, and because they're going without
their medication they're at risk of dying. And how can you be OK with
that? . . . That should never be a decision that a person needs to
make. And unfortunately, it is.''
GAMESMANSHIP AND ANTICOMPETITIVE PRACTICES

Douglas Holtz-Eakin, American Action Forum: ``We have some very
isolated instances of cost associated with off-patent sole-source
drugs. And in those circumstances, it appears that firms are able to
take advantage of their market power and raise the prices of drugs
sharply. This strikes me as a fundamental anti-competitive act that
ought to be investigated.''

Senator Robert Menendez (D-New Jersey): ``Manufacturer coupons,
many suggest, distort spending. . . . Who's winning with these
coupons?'' Peter Bach: ``I can assure you we know who's winning and
it's the people who are printing the coupons . . . the reality is
they're artificial price supports.''

Senator Maggie Hassan (D-New Hampshire): ``We've seen a lot of
bad actors gaming the system over the years, really to pad their
pockets. There are countless ways drug companies take advantage of
loopholes and taxpayers end up footing the bill.''

Mark Miller: ``We need to curb the anticompetitive behaviors of
manufacturers and inject competition back into the marketplace.
Manufacturers benefit from taxpayer-funded NIH research and from
government granted monopolies. And naturally, they devote resources to
protecting those monopolies.''

U.S. Senate
Committee on Finance
Dirksen Senate Office Bldg.
Washington, DC 20510-6200
RE: ``Drug Pricing in America,'' Senate hearing held on February 26,
2019
Dear Finance Committee:
On Wednesday January 23, 2019, I gave myself my last weekly
injection of Humira, which had helped my mobility due to psoriatic
arthritis. I have done very well for the past two years with this
drug--one typically requiring a biweekly 40mg syringe injection. But I
just started a new medication, an infusion administered in my doctor's
office by an outsourced nurse who's not part of the practice.
I needed to switch to the infused medication because on March 1st--
when I became eligible for Medicare--Humira would increase from $5/
monthly under our previous private insurer, Anthem Blue Cross, to a
prohibitive $800+ per injection with Medicare Part D coverage. Bottom
line: Medicare does not cover self-injections. Because an infusion
would be administered in my rheumatologist's office, it is 100% covered
as a medical procedure through Part B via Medicare. Now, I understand
why Humira's advertisements, invading my television screen no matter
what time or what channel I watch, always feature younger people
engaged in various physical activities.
When I needed information about how to navigate this insurance
morass, I called my Humira ambassador, an AbbVie employee who serves as
a liaison between the consumer and the company. She assured me that I
may be covered if I submitted my tax returns to the company's
foundation. Evidently if I make less than $65,000, through the
company's assistance program, the parent company's foundation pays a
portion of the thousands needed to offset consumers' exorbitant cost of
this drug; however, regardless of my income, I have a huge problem
submitting my tax statements to anyone--except to my trusted accountant
and the IRS.
It seems AbbVie puts some big money into tiers of bureaucracy
through advertising, marketing, and supporting a foundation based on
employees forced to donate a percentage of their income. In addition,
whenever a consumer needs to have the simplest question answered by the
company, instead of AbbVie offering an 800 phone number, that consumer
must first enroll in the ``Ambassador Program,'' then wait for their
designated ambassador to return the call. I've had two ambassadors so
far, and each seems more than willing to keep me on the phone for an
extended time, asking all kinds of questions, as if padding their own
positions by calling consumers on a monthly basis. I'd much prefer that
these ambassadors work to figure out ways to reduce the drug's cost, so
consumers like me can afford it.
Switching to new medication certainly had caused me some angst. I
had no sense of how I will respond to the new infusion. Based on
history, I've had my share of side effects during the 38 years I've
been dealing with arthritis. I have trouble with drugs that are
ingested through the GI tract. I also have had two different cancers, a
risk accompanying many of the biologic arthritis medications. In
addition, I've had some serious adverse reactions to medications,
requiring hospitalization. Lucky for me, the new infusion, 100% covered
by Medicare Part B, seems to be working well.
Despite having this ailment, I consider myself to be healthy, doing
whatever possible to maintain whatever I can do to stay well to
overcome arthritis' swelling, fatigue, and pain that has challenged me
physically and mentally. I probably have had more knee aspirations and
steroid injections than some Olympic athletes. My Fitbit gets a daily
workout. Even after trying many alternative treatments in search of a
solution, Humira seemed to help me resume a normal life. And for that,
I was grateful.
AbbVie Chairman and CEO Richard A Gonzalez stated at the U.S.
Senate Finance Committee on February 26, 2019, ``We believe it is
important that discussions about access and affordability include a
focus on how to alleviate Medicare Part D out-of-pocket burdens above
and beyond just lowering list prices.'' I must raise the question to
AbbVie: What is the company doing internally to cut costs for
consumers?
I am hoping that you will help address the mounting bureaucratic
issues surrounding health care in America that make it challenging for
consumers to afford and navigate. Please feel free to reach out to me
if you need more information or assistance in any way.
Yours,
Linda George

Statement of Robin K. Huszagh
February 26, 2019
After listening to the hearing today on C-SPAN, I wanted to share my
situation with you as a patient being forced to pay the full
``negotiated'' price for Humira and Enbrel. My husband and I are self-
employed and self-insured. We must purchase health insurance through
the independent ``retail'' market. I specifically renewed a
grandfathered ``retail'' PPO health insurance policy we've had since
2010 for our family of 3, now priced at $2,166.00/month, so that could
get the specialty formulary I needed to treat my Rheumatoid Arthritis
at an affordable price and continue to see my doctors. To my distress,
the Insurer (BCBS) and Pharmacy Benefit Manager (Prime Therapeutics)
altered the PPO plan's pharmacy benefits (cost sharing details) after
the plan commenced, leaving me with an expensive policy that no longer
covers my expensive specialty formulary at an affordable price. Unlike
typical commercial employer-based group policies, once I needed the
expensive specialty formulary, my independent retail PPO policy was
switched into a restricted pharmacy network with only one mail-order
supplier and an ``Accumulator Adjustment Program.'' The Insurer/PBM
also blocked the use of drug manufacturer's discount coupons and
programs completely (worth $12,000 to $16,000 per year in my case) so
that a drug that used to cost me $5.00 to $10.00 per month with a
manufacturer's coupon now costs between $5356 to $6652 per month, the
negotiated contract rate between the insurer and the drug manufacturer.
My deductible was raised from $2600 to $5200 for a 20% coinsurance
responsibility and $11,200 out-of-pocket max for full benefits. The
insurer added a second review process in 2019 for any drug with a
contract rate of $5000/month or higher, in addition to the one put in
place in 2018 as part of a ``step therapy'' restriction/review. In 2019
the price for both Humira and Enbrel jumped to over $5000 per month and
the insurer has stated their ``secondary review'' would allow them to
deny benefits for these drugs even though the policy states they are
approved formularies.
At the current premium rate, paying for insurance and an expensive
formulary has been financially challenging to say the least and has
caused us to take an early withdrawal from our IRA. I contacted the
Illinois Department of Insurance and asked why insurers can change
pharmacy benefits mid-year and weren't required to document the
specific cost-sharing and pharmacy details on all insurance policy
documents, so benefits are locked in for the year. I was told those
details are NOT a requirement for retail plans, and pharmacy benefit
changes are allowed to occur throughout the life of the contract which
also includes medication price changes. So, if a consumer buys a policy
based on access and pricing for a particular drug, there is no
guarantee the terms will remain in effect for the full contract year. I
was never notified of the changes even after contacting the insurer. I
hadn't realized any changes until I went to the pharmacy to pick up a
prescription and hit the payment ``brick wall''!
The Network Transparency Act of 2019 was passed in Illinois, however
that only set policy guidelines for ``notification requirements'' to
the policy holder if a particular provider pulls out of a network but
doesn't address the insurer's ability to change a policy's pharmacy
benefits mid-year, leaving the policy holder with a shocking bill. The
contract price for Humira went up 9% in January, the cost of my PPO
policy went up 9% in 2019, and now I'm required to pay a higher
premium, higher out-of-pocket max, and the full price for Humira
without the use of manufacturer's discount programs. Patients with
employer-based group plans who are already benefiting from employer
cost-sharing perks are allowed the use of discount programs and coupons
at the point of sale (the pharmacy) because the insurer and the
employer never know the coupon is being used as a form of payment at
the retail pharmacy location. The coupon value pays for the drug and
that hidden payment is applied to the user's deductible. Those who
benefit from these programs do not care what the list price or the
negotiated price is for a high-priced drug because they never have to
actually pay it, the insurer pays for it because deductibles and out-
of-pocket limits are met early in the year. Those with commercial group
plans obtain specialty formularies for $5 to $10 per month. I have to
pay the full price. The change in my PPO policy was intentionally made
by the insurer to ensure I personally pay the full cost of the drug for
as long as possible. They do not want me to get assistance from Pharma
to reach my deductible or maximum. There is no relief in sight for the
independently insured who have no employer or government subsidies and
actually pay the full high price for each medication and monthly
insurance premiums. With the majority of Americans getting health
insurance perks from their employer and using drug coupons, there is no
incentive for drug manufacturers to ever lower list prices.

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member and Members of the Committee:
ICCR is a coalition of over 300 global institutional investors
representing more than $400 billion in managed assets. Leveraging our
equity ownership in some of the world's largest and most powerful
companies, ICCR members regularly engage management to identify and
mitigate social and environmental risks resulting from corporate
operations and policies. While ICCR members never shy away from making
the moral case for action, our fundamental proposition as investors is
that responsible and sustainable business practices--and a strong
corporate culture of ethics--are in the long-term interest of
companies, investors and communities.
ICCR members have a long-standing history of engagement with
pharmaceutical companies on issues of price restraint, equitable
pricing strategies, anti-competitive practices, marketing policies and
practice, as well as disclosure of R&D expenditures (e.g., report on
the number of products in the R&D pipeline that are new versus enhanced
versions of existing products) and lobbying/political activities with
agendas that may restrict the access and affordability of medicines.
For decades, ICCR members have pressed drug companies for greater
disclosures on pricing structures as a way to promote greater access to
medicines. A lack of transparency around how drug prices are determined
has led to an industry-wide ethos of ``whatever the market will bear,''
which can lead to predatory pricing. We have asked companies to
disclose the rates of price increases year-to-year of their top selling
branded prescriptions drugs and to disclose the rationale and criteria
used for these price increases. We have also asked the companies to
assess the legislative, reputational and financial risks these
increases represent for the companies. However, that lack of
transparency still prevails.
Most recently, we have become increasingly concerned about
pharmaceutical companies' governance structures and their Boards'
ability to proactively mitigate risk related to high drug prices. A
2017 Credit Suisse analyst report stated that ``US drug price rises
contributed 100% of industry EPS growth in 2016'' and characterized
that fact as ``the most important issue for a Pharma investor today.''
In response to this, in 2018 ICCR members filed resolutions at the
companies highlighted in the 2017 Credit Suisse report asking ``the
Compensation Committee (the `Committee') to report annually to
shareholders on the extent to which risks related to public concern
over drug pricing strategies are integrated into [company's] incentive
compensation policies, plans and programs (`arrangements') for senior
executives. The report should include, but need not be limited to,
discussion of whether (i) incentive compensation arrangements reward,
or not penalize, senior executives for adopting pricing strategies, or
making and honoring commitments about pricing, that incorporate public
concern regarding prescription drug prices; and (ii) such concern is
taken into account when setting financial targets for incentive
compensation arrangements.'' In other words, are executives
incentivized to simply increase the price of drugs with no added
benefit in clinical efficacy simply to meet short-term revenue targets?
In particular, we are seeking better articulation of the goal-setting
process and the translation of those goals into incentive pay targets.
We would strongly encourage you, as members of the Senate Finance
Committee, to also seek written answers to the following questions:

How assumptions about price changes are incorporated when
revenue goals are set;

Whether any policy or guideline exists regarding the preferred
proportion of revenue growth derived from price increases;

Whether any policy exists regarding unplanned price increases
that would enable revenue goals or compensation revenue targets to be
met and whether the board has to approve such increases; and

How the compensation committee uses revenue goals or estimates
to produce the various target levels (e.g., minimum, target and
maximum) used to determine incentive payouts.
Mirroring Senator Wyden's concern that AbbVie's CEO's bonus is directly
tied to the sales of Humira, we have also been asking why Humira sales
are an appropriate measure for AbbVie's short-term incentive plan
(STIP), and whether the company considers pricing increases when
awarding STIP? AbbVie uses net revenue, income before taxes and Humira
sales as metrics for the annual bonus and earnings per share (EPS) as a
metric for certain long-term incentive awards to senior executives. For
Pfizer, it is concerning to investors that the company publicly states
that ``innovation in medicine has been and continues to be the
cornerstone of the company,'' yet no pipeline metrics are included in
the executive incentive agreements.
In addition to increased disclosure on incentive structures, we have
also asked companies to formalize board oversight of prescription drug
pricing risk. For example, what is Pfizer's board oversight of drug
pricing, or lack thereof, which may have led to the settlement of the
co-pay kickback investigation and drug shortages due to manufacturing
or market issues. A 2018 Credit Suisse report highlighted AbbVie as
among the companies most at risk from specialty pricing pressures in
commercial insurance. Humira, which accounted for 65% of AbbVie's
revenues in 2017 now faces competition in Europe from biosimilars,
which are expected to cost less. Therefore, robust board oversight of
risks related to drug pricing would provide a valuable outside
perspective and help ensure that those risks are being managed for the
long term.
Lastly, we also recognize that the strategy to expand monopolies
without any meaningful new science is an unsustainable business model
that exacts a heavy cost on patients and on the systems in which they
seek care, and therefore, encourage companies to refrain from engaging
in anti-competitive practices.
As investors, we want the companies in which we invest to be successful
in the long term, with sustainable business models that deliver value
to customers and stakeholders. Because pharmaceutical companies derive
their social license to operate from their contribution to public
health, it is critical that their businesses--including their executive
incentives structures--reinforce, not undermine, that social contract.
After many years of investor engagement in an effort to promote greater
access and affordability of medicines, today we seriously question the
value pharmaceutical companies are delivering to their shareholders and
to the greater public.
If you have any questions, please contact, Meg Jones-Monteiro, Program
Director--Health Equity, at [email protected] or (212) 870-2984.
APPENDIX: 2019 ICCR EXECUTIVE INCENTIVES AND
DRUG PRICING RISK RESOLUTIONS
2018 Companies: AbbVie, Amgen, Biogen, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Eli Lilly
2019 Companies: AbbVie, Biogen, Bristol-Meyers Squibb, Celgene, Johnson
& Johnson, Merck & Co, Pfizer, Vertex
Example 2019 Resolutions:
AbbVie (ABBV)
_______________________________________________________________________
RESOLVED, that shareholders of AbbVie Inc. (``AbbVie'') urge the
Compensation Committee (the ``Committee'') to report annually to
shareholders on the extent to which risks related to public concern
over drug pricing strategies are integrated into AbbVie's incentive
compensation policies, plans and programs (together, ``arrangements'')
for senior executives. The report should include, but need not be
limited to, discussion of whether (i) incentive compensation
arrangements reward, or not penalize, senior executives for adopting
pricing strategies, or making and honoring commitments about pricing,
that incorporate public concern regarding the level or rate of increase
in prescription drug prices; and (ii) such concern is considered when
setting financial targets for incentive compensation arrangements.
Supporting Statement: As long-term investors, we believe that senior
executive incentive compensation arrangements should reward the
creation of sustainable long-term value. To that end, it is important
that those arrangements align with company strategy and encourage
responsible risk management.
A key risk facing pharmaceutical companies is potential backlash
against high drug prices. Societal anger over exorbitant prices and
pressure over limited patients' access due to unaffordability may force
price rollbacks and harm corporate reputation.
We applaud AbbVie for committing not to increase prices by more than
10% for 2018, yet we are unaware of a like commitment for 2019 or
beyond. Moreover, we are concerned that the incentive compensation
arrangements applicable to AbbVie's senior executives may undermine any
such commitment.
AbbVie uses net revenue, income before taxes and Humira sales as
metrics for the annual bonus and earnings per share (EPS) as a metric
for certain long-term incentive awards to senior executives (2018 Proxy
Statement, at 31). A 2017 Credit Suisse analyst report stated that ``US
drug price rises contributed 100% of industry EPS growth in 2016'' and
characterized that fact as ``the most important issue for a Pharma
investor today.'' The report identified AbbVie as a company where price
increases accounted for at least 100% of EPS growth in 2016 (Global
Pharma and Biotech Sector Review: Exploring Future US Pricing Pressure,
Apr. 18, 2017, at 1). It has been noted that the company's 2018 9.7%
price increase for Humira could add $1.2 billion to the U.S. healthcare
system (https://www.fiercepharma.com/pharma/drug-price-hikes-a-few-bad-
actors-or-widespread-pharma?mkt_tok=eyJpljoiWWpZeFlt

ZOVRBNXdTV1FOeVNBSDMxb3NWUGJsRWtNcFROZmlPYmM5d2hXd3VuVOkld
GICelBTYmk2).
In our view, excessive dependence on drug price increases is a risky
and unsustainable strategy, especially when price hikes drive large
senior executive payouts. We believe that the company's strategy to use
``nursing support,'' which the California Department of Insurance
claims in its suit against the company to be largely a kickback scheme
to boost Humira sales, may have been better managed by leadership if
Humira sales were not an explicit part of the payment incentive plan
(https://www.law360.com/articles/1084008).
The disclosure we request would allow shareholders to better assess the
extent to which compensation arrangements encourage senior executives
to responsibly manage risks relating to drug pricing and contribute to
long-term value creation. We urge shareholders to vote for this
Proposal.
Merck & Co. (MRK)
_______________________________________________________________________
RESOLVED, that shareholders of Merck & Co., Inc. (``Merck'') urge the
Compensation and Benefits Committee to report annually to shareholders
on the extent to which risks related to public concern over drug
pricing strategies are integrated into Merck's incentive compensation
policies, plans and programs (``arrangements'') for senior executives.
The report should include, but need not be limited to, discussion of
whether (i) incentive compensation arrangements reward, or not
penalize, senior executives for adopting pricing strategies, or making
and honoring commitments about pricing, that incorporate public concern
regarding prescription drug prices; and (ii) such concern is considered
when setting financial targets for incentive compensation arrangements.
Supporting Statement: As long-term investors, we believe that senior
executive incentive compensation arrangements should reward the
creation of sustainable value. To that end, it is important that those
arrangements align with company strategy and encourage responsible risk
management.
We are concerned that the incentive compensation arrangements
applicable to Merck's senior executives may discourage them from taking
actions that result in lower short-term financial performance even when
those actions may be in Merck's best long-term interests. Merck has
committed to limit average price increases of its drugs to no more than
the rate of inflation (https://www.marketwatch.com/story/merck-to-
lower-price-of-hep-c-treatment-zepatier-by-60-commits-to-responsible-
pricing-2018-07-19), but incentive compensation arrangements may be
inconsistent with that commitment.
Merck uses revenue and pre-tax income as metrics for the annual bonus,
and earnings per share (EPS) is a metric for performance share units
granted after January 1, 2017 (2018 Proxy Statement, at 51, 61). A 2017
Credit Suisse analyst report identified Merck as a company where U.S.
net price increases accounted for at least 100% of 2016 net income
growth (Global Pharma and Biotech Sector Review: Exploring Future US
Pricing Pressure, Apr. 18, 2017, at 22).
In our view, risks to long-term value arise when large senior executive
payouts can be driven by price hikes. Attention may focus on both high
senior executive payouts and drug pricing, fueling public outrage. Ovid
Therapeutics CEO Jeremy Levin has argued that incentives to boost
short-term performance, such as EPS, lead executives to raise prices
(and rebates to middlemen), starve research and development and buy
back shares (https://www.biocentury.com/biocentury/strategy/2016-09-19/
why-jeremy-levin-says-executive-compensation-and-drug-pricing-must-).
Incentives may have societal implications, as one critic of high pay
for healthcare executives has noted: ``[I]f the most influential
executives of these companies are being paid to keep that [cost]
trajectory up, that's money that's being taken away from education or
infrastructure or other parts of the economy that may not be growing as
quickly, and maybe that we'd want to grow more quickly'' (https://
www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/07/26/539518682/as-cost-of-u-s-
heaIth-care-skyrockets-so-does-pay-of-heaIth-care-ceos).
The disclosure we request would allow shareholders to better assess the
extent to which compensation arrangements encourage senior executives
to responsibly manage risks relating to drug pricing and contribute to
long-term value creation. For example, it would be useful for investors
to know whether incentive compensation target amounts reflect
consideration of pricing pressures. We urge shareholders to vote for
this Proposal.
Pfizer (PFE)
_______________________________________________________________________
RESOLVED, that shareholders of Pfizer Inc. (``Pfizer'') urge the
Compensation Committee (the ``Committee'') to report annually to
shareholders on the extent to which risks related to public concern
over drug pricing strategies are integrated into Pfizer's incentive
compensation policies, plans and programs (``arrangements'') for senior
executives. The report should include, but need not be limited to,
discussion of whether (i) incentive compensation arrangements reward,
or not penalize, senior executives for adopting pricing strategies, or
making and honoring commitments about pricing, that incorporate public
concern regarding prescription drug prices; and (ii) such concern is
considered when setting financial targets for incentive compensation
arrangements.
Supporting Statement: As long-term investors, we believe that senior
executive incentive compensation arrangements should reward the
creation of sustainable value. To that end, it is important that those
arrangements align with company strategy and encourage responsible risk
management.
A key risk facing pharmaceutical companies is potential backlash
against high drug prices. Pfizer has been criticized for repeated price
increases, and in July 2018 President Trump called out ``Pfizer and
others'' in a tweet, saying they ``should be ashamed that they have
raised drug prices for no reason''; Pfizer then postponed planned
increases.
We are concerned that the incentive compensation arrangements
applicable to Pfizer's senior executives may discourage them from
taking actions, like foregoing price increases that result in lower
short-term financial performance even when those actions may be in
Pfizer's best long-term interests.
Pfizer uses revenue and earnings per share (EPS) as metrics for the
annual bonus and operating income as a metric for performance share
awards (2018 Proxy Statement, at 66, 68). A 2017 Credit Suisse analyst
report identified Pfizer as a company where U.S. net price increases
accounted for at least 100% of 2016 net income growth (Global Pharma
and Biotech Sector Review: Exploring Future US Pricing Pressure, Apr.
18, 2017, at 22). In its 2018 report, Credit Suisse characterized
Pfizer's 2017 10% net price increase as above average for the industry
and noted that its list price increases were the second highest (Global
Pharmaceuticals: Scoring Sensitivity to Trump's Reforms, May 25, 2018,
at 15, 20).
In our view, excessive dependence on drug price increases is a risky
and unsustainable strategy, especially when price hikes appear to drive
large senior executive payouts. Highlighting this connection, a March
2018 article carried the headline, ``Pfizer CEO Gets 61% Pay Raise--to
$27.9 Million--As Drug Prices Continue to Climb'' (https://
arstechnica.com/science/2018/03/amid-drug-price-increases-pfizer-ceo-
gets-61-pay-raise-to-27-9-million/; see also https://www.usnews.com/
opinion/articles/2017-08-30/bernie-sanders-take-on-big-pharma-and-
lower-prescription-drug-prices). We are concerned that large payouts
based on financial metrics that can be affected by pricing create risks
for Pfizer.
The disclosure we request would allow shareholders to better assess the
extent to which compensation arrangements encourage senior executives
to responsibly manage risks relating to drug pricing and contribute to
long-term value creation. For example, it would be useful for investors
to know whether incentive compensation target amounts reflect
consideration of pricing pressures. We urge shareholders to vote for
this Proposal.

National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics
1800 Diagonal Road, Suite 600
Alexandria, VA 22314
Nicole Lamoureux, President and Chief Executive Officer
Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden and Members of the Committee,
my name is Nicole Lamoureux and I am the President and Chief Executive
Officer of the National Association of Free and Charitable Clinics.
Last month, I was sitting in the hearing room as the pharma executives
testified. While I applaud Congress for finally getting these
executives to speak, I noticed some important gaps in the conversation.
During the hearing, both Congress and the pharmaceutical executives
focused on a specific group of Americans: those with health insurance.
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Grassley opened the hearing by
describing how high list prices hurt ``those with high deductibles''
and ``taxpayers,'' but did not mention the uninsured. While we
understand that the committee's focus remains largely on health
programs within your jurisdiction that require significant federal
investments, we believe that by not addressing the high cost of
medication for the uninsured as well as the insured, the overall cost
of health care will continue to increase.
When medication costs are too high, uninsured individuals must forgo
their medication or split doses, and often end up needing the emergency
department for both the repercussions of missed prescriptions and for
primary care. Research shows that 75 percent of all emergency
department visits not resulting in admission are for non-emergencies
that should be treated outside of the emergency room (Hwang et al.
2012). Patients who lack insurance and access to primary care are often
forced to use the emergency room for routine medical needs. These
emergency room visits are expensive, contribute to overcrowding, and
drive up healthcare costs for everyone.
Currently, there are 27 million Americans without insurance--about 1 in
12 people--and that number is growing. I know this group well. These
are the people who receive access to health care and medication from
the 1,400 free and charitable clinics in our country. Free and
Charitable Clinics are safety-net health care organizations that
utilize a volunteer/staff model to provide a range of medical, dental,
pharmacy, vision and/or behavioral health services to economically
disadvantaged individuals. Such clinics are 501(c)(3) tax-exempt
organizations or operate as a program component or affiliate of a
501(c)(3) organization. Free or Charitable Clinics restrict eligibility
for their services to individuals who are uninsured, underinsured and/
or have limited or no access to primary, specialty or prescription
health care. Additionally, Free and Charitable Clinics receive little
to no state funding and no federal funding, do not receive HRSA 330
funds, and are not Federally Qualified Health Centers or Rural Health
Centers. Therefore, these clinics rely heavily on the generosity of
individual donors, foundations and grants as funding sources.
Even though our organizations do not receive federal funding, we are
impacted by every decision that is made at the federal level,
especially when it comes to medication affordability. In 2018, the
1,400 free and charitable clinics served 2 million Americans, with a
total of 6.3 million patient visits. In the most recent data reported
by our members, the number one concern for both our patient population
and their providers is the high cost of medication.
I understand why Medicaid and Medicare patients were the main focus of
the testimony, but the needs of millions of uninsured Americans are
also critical to the conversation about solving the pricing issues and
inequities of the current healthcare system. When Congress asked the
seven executives, ``Who pays list price?'' Merck CEO Ken Frazier
responded by saying, ``There's a small percentage of people who have no
insurance who could actually be charged the list price.'' He also said
that in our current system, ``The poorest and the sickest are
subsidizing others.'' Senator Daines summarized the issue this way: "So
the people who can afford it the least, arguably, are paying the list
price?''
Those who are paying the list price are our patients, the uninsured and
underinsured in this country. The current minimum price of $150 for a
vial of insulin is not affordable for a mother making the choice
between putting food on her table or paying for her prescription. Our
patients have no choice but to ration medications, taking lower doses
of them or stopping them altogether. We have no shortage of these
stories, from young adults eating less than they should to reduce the
amount of insulin they need to parents starving themselves to afford
insulin for their children. In our network of clinics, this is a lived
reality.
In a time when few issues are truly bipartisan, and health care
continues to become ever more divisive, the exponential growth of drug
prices is a rare issue that crosses the aisle. Needing insulin isn't
red or blue, nor is using an EpiPen or depending on an inhaler to
breathe. We need to harness this rare moment of unity and push for true
progress.
I know that Congress realizes how important it is to have the
conversation to make medication more affordable once and for all, so we
can fix this broken system. I want to make sure we get it right this
time around. America's free and charitable clinics try to catch the
people who slip through the cracks. If we don't stop this unchecked
rise in the cost of medications, these cracks will widen until they
threaten the foundation of our health care system.
I appreciate the opportunity to submit my comments to the hearing
record on behalf of the 2 million Americans who receive care at free
and charitable clinics and look forward to answering any questions that
the committee might have.

Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden and members of the Senate
Committee on Finance, thank you for the opportunity to submit a
statement for the record on the large employers' perspective on drug
pricing.
The National Business Group on Health (NBGH or the ``Business Group''),
whose members include 437 of the nation's largest employers, commend
the Committee's effort to take a holistic look at the root causes of
high and escalating drug prices. In addition to these, we anticipate
submitting comments on subsequent hearings within the Committee's
series on drug pricing.
Along with the government, taxpayers and families, employers have a
vested interest in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of health
care delivery, which includes the delivery of pharmaceuticals.
According to NBGH's 2019 Large Employers' Health Care Strategy and Plan
Design Survey, almost half, 49% of respondents are taking an activist
role in driving delivery system change.\1\ As part of this, more
employers are scrutinizing the role of the pharmaceutical supply chain,
as specialty pharmacy costs remain one of the top drivers of overall
health care trend. Particularly as the growth of high-deductible plans
over the past decade has put a spotlight on drug prices, employers have
become increasingly frustrated by complexity within the supply chain,
which could be described as a ``rebate-driven'' contracting model.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ 2019 Large Employers' Health Care Strategy and Plan Design
Survey, National Business Group on Health.
Nearly all employers believe the pharmaceutical supply chain model
needs to change:

14% believe it needs to be more transparent.

35% believe rebates need to be reduced.

49% believe the model needs to be overhauled and simplified.
Regarding the use of rebates as a mechanism to control drug costs:

75% do not believe drug manufacturer rebates are an effective
tool for helping to drive down pharmaceutical costs.

91% would welcome an alternative to the rebate-driven approach
to managing drug costs.
The rapid pace at which reforms are being considered within the
marketplace and by both legislative and regulatory bodies at the
federal and state levels is encouraging. A focus of the hearing, the
Administration's proposals to implement changes to how pharmaceutical
reimbursement and contracting is administered within Medicare Part Band
Part D illuminates the need and possibility that there are likely to be
multiple solutions that improve upon the current model within the
private and public sector. NBGH supports a model marked by
transparency, and one that removes incentives to consistently increase
prescription drug prices. However, we also urge cautious, thoughtful,
and analytical approaches that comprehensively evaluate the impact to
market dynamics for all supply chain stakeholders.
Below, we highlight NBGH's perspectives on two of the widely discussed
proposals. Our full comments on the International Pricing Index (IPI)
model can be found online. Additionally, we intend to provide full
comments on the rebate proposal by the April 8th deadline.
International Pricing Index (IPI) Model \2\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\2\ ``International Pricing Index (IPI) Model,'' Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Innovation, accessed March 11, 2019.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We must take a broad perspective to assure that public policy
decisions contribute to overall cost control and quality improvement
for all Americans. We commend the Administration's commitment to
lowering the cost of prescription drugs and encourage it to seek
solutions. However, we strongly recommend that whatever CMS adopts,
part of the consideration and criteria for evaluating the results must
be the impact on the private market and the 170 plus million people
covered by employers and insurers and not limited to the impact on
Medicare alone. If we as a nation are to succeed in controlling health
care costs, we must ensure that public policy decisions do not merely
``squeeze the cost balloon'' in one area only for it to expand and
exacerbate the problem in another area.

Our chief concern centers on the ANPRM's proposal to link
reimbursement rates to other nations' prices. Apart from the fact that
these nations determine prices differently, have different patent and
exclusivity models, and often vastly different incentives for
biosimilar utilization, we are concerned that the impact on prices for
the same pharmaceuticals in the US may rise in the private sector and
the market for biosimilars may be adversely impacted if Medicare adopts
this approach.
Rebate Reform Proposal \3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ ``Fraud and Abuse; Removal of Safe Harbor Protection for
Rebates Involving Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Creation of New Safe
Harbor Protection for Certain Point-of-Sale Reductions in Price on
Prescription Pharmaceuticals and Certain Pharmacy Benefit Manager
Service Fees'' (Federal Register, February 6, 2019).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Many large employers have already begun evaluating the utility of
point-of-sale rebates as part of their benefit design and a subset (29
percent) have them in place today. Thus, HHS's proposal picks up on the
momentum from large employers and, more importantly, underscores the
inefficiency of the pharmaceutical supply chain. Given the market
momentum on this issue, to both lower out-of-pocket costs for patients
and evaluate ways to simplify a complex system, the Business Group is
in favor of market-based solutions relative to point-of-sale rebates.
NBGH has the following serious concerns about proposals around rebates.
While the stated goal of these proposals is to lower prescription drug
prices and out-of-pocket costs for consumers by encouraging PBMs to
pass discounts from drug manufacturers directly on to consumers and
bring transparency to prescription drug market, we have various
concerns with the proposals including but not limited to the following:

The proposals focus on out-of-pocket costs only. The intent of
the proposed rule and companion legislation is to lower out-of-pocket
costs at the pharmacy counter and add needed pricing transparency to
the market. While we support the proposed increased transparency and
pricing relief for patients, we urge policy makers to avoid ``quick
fixes'' that focus only on out-of-pocket costs, as opposed to total
cost to the system. Focusing on out-of-pocket costs only has the
potential to mask root causes of price increases, potentially lead to
even higher increases over time, and drive the escalating trend on drug
expenditures.

Any changes in supply-chain contracting should not result in a
net increase in drug costs to any payor, nor windfall to any supply
chain stakeholder. Medicaid and CHIP Payment and Access, the
Congressional Budget Office Commission (MACPAC) staff have noted that
the CMS Office of the Actuary (OACT) estimated a net increase in
Medicaid drug spending of $200 million over 10 years if the proposed
rebate rule is finalized. A large chunk, if not the largest chunk, of
this expected increase would come from the decline in inflation-based
rebates.\4\ Further, manufacturer claim liabilities through the
coverage gap discount program (CGDP) would be lower, which would
produce an overall substantial savings for
manufacturers.\5\, \6\ While savings is expected, that
savings should be realized comprehensively across both the supply and
demand sides of the pharmaceutical supply chain.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ ``Proposed Safe Harbor Regulation Impact'' (Office of the
Actuary, August 30, 2018).
\5\ Manufacturer payments through the CGDP are expected to be about
$2 billion per year lower on average. When POS costs are lower, it
takes longer for he costs to accumulate toward the initial coverage
limit (ICL) and the TrOOP threshold. CGDP payments would be lower as
fewer members would be calculated as a percentage of a lower POS cost,
but the impact would vary by manufacturer and by plan sponsor.
\6\ ``Impact of Potential Changes to the Treatment of Manufacturer
Rebates'' (Milliman, Inc., January 31, 2019).

The proposals do nothing to address list prices. The proposed
rule ``intends'' and speculates that manufacturers might lower list
prices, but there is little assurance that manufacturers will offset
rebates with price reductions. In fact, at the hearing, not all CEOs in
attendance would affirmatively state this would be the case at all, due
to antitrust case law.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ ``Foley Hoag LLP white paper, ``Antitrust Implications of a
Proposed HHS Rule to Limit Manufacturer Rebates,'' accessed March 11,
2019.

The proposed timeline within the HHS proposal is arguably too
aggressive. PBMs have largely already concluded negotiations on price
concessions for plan year 2020 and are in the middle of actuarial
analysis to prepare bids. There is no way to renegotiate in time to
know the associated costs in order to bid properly, and it would be
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
impossible to retool the supply chain in such a short period of time.

Premiums will increase. The proposals are projected to increase
the cost of healthcare for those who don't use drugs having rebates,
through premium increases, while disproportionately decreasing costs
for those who do use drugs with discounts.
Thus, while we agree that the rebate-driven model is ripe for reform
and ineffective at controlling drug prices, we are concerned about the
unintended consequences associated with the proposals as written.
In addition to contracting concerns within the rebate-driven model,
there remains substantial opportunity for policy change relative to
prescription drug prices, most of which would encourage a more
competitive and dynamic market with correspondingly more affordable
prices.
Advance Policies to Promote More Affordable, Financially Sustainable
Prescription Drug Pricing
While many of the recommendations below are directed toward various
agencies in the Administration, several of them require Congressional
action. All of these policy recommendations are highlighted in the
National Business Group on Health's Issue Brief on Policy
Recommendations to Promote Sustainable, Affordable Pricing for
Specialty Pharmaceuticals.

Remove Uncertainties Surrounding Risk-based and Value-Oriented
Contracting and Implement Indication Specific Pricing and Reference
Pricing in Public Programs:
-
Consider exemptions for value-based contracts from Medicaid
best price requirements and clarify how drug makers and payers can
conceive of value-based contracts without triggering broader Medicaid
best price program implications.
-
Allow for variable pricing, where the price better reflects
the evidence for benefit.
-
Evaluate the usefulness and application of the existing
developed value frameworks and their potential to impact drug pricing
in public programs, as well as their overall utility to the health care
system.
-
Directly link reimbursement and improved patient outcomes.
-
Consider how drug makers and payers can enter into other
types of innovative VBP arrangements, such as indication-specific
pricing.
-
Implement reference pricing policies supported by clinical
evidence consistently across public programs, where possible.

Limit Reach of Medicare Part D Protected Classes:
-
Following the MedPAC's recommendations, the Congress and CMS
should limit legislative and regulatory restrictions on formulary
design within protected classes by modifying the Medicare Part D rules
to remove those protected classes where enough generic competition
exists, a change that would give private plans more freedom to control
their formularies and negotiate for expanded manufacturer rebates.
-
Specifically, CMS should resubmit its proposal to remove
antidepressants, antipsychotics, and immunosuppressants for transplant
rejection from the list of protected classes because, in these classes,
price reductions have been more closely linked with the availability of
generics than to their status as ``protected'' and stand firm against
industry-funded campaigns that seek to undermine the agency's data-
driven proposal to increase competitive pricing.
-
At a minimum, policy makers should evaluate the potential
anticompetitive influence of protected classes on the commercial
market, and specifically, evaluate the limitations imposed on private
payers' ability to negotiate competitive prices for drugs in the
protected classes due to market spillover.

Eliminate Perverse Payment Incentives Under Medicare Part B:
-
Eliminate financial incentives for prescribing more
expensive medicines, in more expensive settings.
-
Establish direct links between reimbursement and improved
patient outcomes.
-
Encourage manufacturers to assume some financial risk for
use of high-priced drugs.

Encourage the Uptake of Biosimilars:
-
Consider the utility of having an ``interchangeability''
distinction and potential alignment with the European biosimilars
model, which has no such distinction.
-
Work with stakeholders to disseminate provider and patient
education to firmly establish the safety and efficacy of biosimilar
drugs to their reference products, recognizing that key successes to
the uptake of biosimilar medicines in other countries was predicated on
the creation of trust and confidence among all the stakeholders
involved, such as prescribers, pharmacists, and patients.
-
Maintain payer autonomy to implement utilization management
tools for specialty pharmaceuticals, including tools that pertain to
biosimilar products.

Reform Permissive Patent and Exclusivity Protocols:
-
Reduce the market exclusivity period for biologics from 12
years to 7 years.
-
Eliminate or limit additive patent extensions and
exclusivity periods that serve only to extend monopoly power,
especially where there is limited, or no additional company investment
or patient value produced.
-
Develop sound policy that would discourage patent abuses
such as ``evergreening'' and ``product hopping.'' These policies may
include financial penalties, loss of exclusivity periods and/or reduced
patent terms for other products.
-
Refine the biosimilars patent dance to effectively
incentivize the use of the section 351(1) patent dispute resolution
provisions.

Reject anticompetitive ``quick fixes'':
-
As consumers find themselves paying more of their drug
costs, it's tempting to be lured into new policies which may only
further contribute to an anticompetitive climate. These policies may
include specialty drug price caps, out-of-pocket payment caps,
limitations on utilization management tools and mandated disclosure of
propriety information.
-
Additionally, a federal law permitting importation
nationwide could lead to some price reductions for both payors and
patients in the short-term but, as markets adapt, it is unclear what
the long-term effect on prices would be. It would also likely require a
significant boost in resources for the Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to monitor imports and assure safety.

National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans
815 16th Street, NW
Washington, DC 20006
Telephone: (202) 737-5315
Michael Scott, Executive Director
The National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans (the
``NCCMP'') appreciates the opportunity to provide comments to the
Committee on the issue of prescription drug pricing and the challenges
that multiemployer group health plans face in today's environment. We
also appreciate the efforts of the Committee to promote discussion of
solutions to America's problem of the high cost of prescription
medications.
Background on the Multiemployer Plans and the NCCMP
Multiemployer plans are a product of the collective bargaining process,
where at least one labor organization and two or more employers provide
health, pension and a variety of other employee benefits through
negotiated contributions to trust funds that are required by law to be
maintained for the ``sole and exclusive benefit'' of plan participants.
Multiemployer plans are jointly trusted by both labor and management
and are subject to applicable provisions of the Taft-Hartley Act,
ERISA, and the Internal Revenue Code. The NCCMP is the only national
organization devoted exclusively to protecting the interests of the
over 20 million active and retired American workers and their families
who rely on multiemployer plans for retirement, health, and other
benefits. The NCCMP is a nonprofit, non-partisan organization with
members, plans, and contributing employers in a broad range of
industries, including agriculture, building and construction, bakery
and confectionary, entertainment, health care, hospitality, longshore,
maritime, mining, retail food, service, steel, and trucking. The
NCCMP's purpose is to assure an environment in which multiemployer
plans continue their vital role in providing benefits to working men
and women.
Multiemployer health plans are often self-insured and plan sponsors
contract with both medical and pharmacy benefit managers to provide
administrative services. These plans provide benefits to both active
workers and their families, and to retirees. Consequently,
multiemployer plans will often contract with a Medicare Part D
Prescription Drug Plan or Medicare Advantage plan to provide
prescription drug and other benefits to retired participants.
Prescription Drug Prices Continue to Rise
Most multiemployer health plans provide prescription drug coverage to
active employees, dependents, and retirees. Prescription drug costs are
a significant part of health plan expenses. Multiemployer plan sponsors
have looked to a variety of means to lower drug prices. Strategies
include increased use of step therapy, prior authorization, quantity
limits, formularies (which exclude certain drugs) and other utilization
management techniques. However, prescription drug cost increases are
primarily driven by price increases, not increased utilization.\1\ Drug
price inflation is a significantly greater component of projected
prescription drug price trend than utilization. In addition, specialty
drug price increases are projected to be in the double digits for 2019,
a significant and concerning pattern because specialty drugs now
account for as much as 35 percent of total pharmacy spending.\2\ New
specialty brand drugs to treat serious illnesses contribute to the cost
increase, and there are limited opportunities to substitute generic
drugs in therapeutic classes dominated by single-source specialty brand
drugs. Consequently, plan sponsors cannot effectively control prices
through utilization controls alone.

Areas for Congressional and/or Regulatory Inquiry and Action
The NCCMP recommends that the Committee take action to promote
transparency in the rebate system while ensuring that action taken on
the rebate side of the pricing equation results in lower--not higher--
drug prices paid by plan sponsors and consumers. In addition, we
emphasize the NCCMP's commitment to eliminating the tax that penalizes
plan sponsors and workers for the high costs of health care (including
drug costs) beyond their control.
Rebates and Transparency
Rebates account for a substantial portion of the drug pricing equation.
Rebate offsets that are passed through to multiemployer plan sponsors
from pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) help to lower net plan cost
trends. However, multiemployer plans must aggressively monitor PBMs to
assure that rebates are actually passed through to the plan, and in
many cases, the rebate structure is opaque and impenetrable. Pricing
structures also change frequently, as can be seen by some of the PBMs
``market pricing'' strategies, which adjust prices, rebates, and
participant cost sharing based on market price variations for certain
drugs.
State legislators are increasingly attempting to rein in drug costs by
passing laws requiring greater transparency. However, those laws may
not be effective, either because the states cannot tackle the problem
alone, or the laws will be subject to multiple challenges by
pharmaceutical manufacturers and PBMs.
As a core principle of ERISA, employee benefit plan fiduciaries need
information concerning all compensation to be received by a service
provider and any conflicts of interest that may adversely affect the
service provider's performance under the contract or arrangement. In
2014, the NCCMP provided supporting testimony to the ERISA Advisory
Council, which was studying PBM Compensation and Fee Disclosure.\3\ At
that time, we suggested that plan fiduciaries would be well served if
PBMs were required to disclose all instances in which they receive
financial remuneration from drug manufacturers, retail pharmacy
providers, and data managers. The disclosures need to be sufficient to
allow trustees to assess whether, and to what extent, the services
offered by the PBMs are in the best interest of plan participants,
rather than simply furthering the financial interests of the PBM.
Transparency continues to be a concern to plan sponsors and efforts of
the Committee to increase transparency for rebates and financial
arrangements between PBMs and pharmaceutical manufacturers would assist
multiemployer plans in efforts to control prescription drug prices.

us/erisa-advisory-council/2014-pbm-compensation-and-fee-disclosure.pdf.
More attention is being paid of late to the rebate system and the
important role that it plays in determining the prices that plan
sponsors and consumers pay for prescription drugs. But rebates are only
part of the equation. The list price that drug manufacturers set for
their prescription drugs is the starting point for the negotiation
between manufacturers and PBMs over rebates. More transparency in the
setting of list prices could help to put some downward pressure on
those prices. But if list prices continue to go up while rebates go
down, plan sponsors and consumers will end up paying more. As a result,
it is essential that any action taken to address the rebate structure
not have the unintended consequence of actually increasing what plan
sponsors and consumers pay for prescription drugs.
Eliminating the Unfair Tax on Health Plan Coverage
For decades before the enactment of the Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act (ACA), the majority of Americans with health
coverage received their coverage through employment. This has remained
the case well after the ACA first went into effect. Today, over 181
million Americans have employment-based health coverage, which includes
coverage under multiemployer plans. The 40 percent excise tax under
Internal Revenue Code section 49801, enacted as part of the ACA,
threatens these hard-working Americans with a steep and unfair tax on
their health coverage. Sometimes popularly (although inappropriately)
referred to as the ``Cadillac plan'' tax, the original intent of the
tax was to impact plans with ``gold-plated coverage.'' In actuality,
however, the tax will have a much broader impact on even modest plans
as a result of underlying medical inflation.
Employers understand that quality health care is an investment in
employees and not simply a monetary benefit. At the same time, both
employers and employees recognize that the cost of health care cannot
become so great that it makes employers non-competitive. This
marketplace reality is the reason that the vast majority of private
plan sponsors have utilized cost containment strategies for decades to
manage and stretch finite compensation dollars as much as possible.
Unfortunately, the high and ever-increasing health care costs faced by
the private sector are directly amplified by the U.S. Government
through its own health care programs, statutes, and regulatory
requirements. As the largest provider and purchaser of health care in
the U.S. through Medicare and Medicaid, programs that collectively
spend more than $1.2 trillion annually,\4\ the U.S. Government's
longstanding policy of significantly under-compensating health care
providers results in these providers charging more to their private
sector clients in order to recoup their uncompensated federal expenses.
In this way, the private sector subsidizes Medicare, Medicaid, and the
U.S. Government by absorbing these uncompensated expenses through
higher costs and premiums.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ In 2017, Medicare spending grew 4.2% to $705.9 billion in 2017
and Medicaid spending grew 2.9% to $581.9; https://www.cms.gov/
research-statistics-data-and-systems/statistics-trends-and-reports/
nationalhealthexpenddata/nhe-fact-sheet.html.
The simple fact is that the high costs of employment-based health plans
and medical inflation are not driven by employment based health plans
themselves, but by other factors, including the actions (and inactions)
of the U.S. Government. Congress should continue to work to address
medical care inflation, including rising drug costs, while maintaining
good health care outcomes and quality of care. Congress should not
penalize employers, health plans, or employees and their families
through unfair taxes. If the excise tax is imposed, the end result will
not be an overall reduction in health care costs, lower medical
inflation or higher federal tax revenue; rather it will be borne by
hardworking Americans through cost-shifting and foregoing needed care.
Additionally, as employment based healthcare is penalized, it will
become increasingly unavailable to those currently covered, which will
increase federal spending on subsidies and Medicare as a significant
portion of the currently covered workforce is eligible for these
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
programs.
NCCMP appreciates the actions Congress has taken in the past to help
prevent the imposition of the 40 percent excise tax by delaying it
twice, so that the effective date is now pushed back to 2022. Delays,
however, are not sufficient to prevent the harmful impact of this tax.
In calling for repeal, NCCMP joins the voices of a large, diverse
group, as evidenced by a recent letter to Congress signed by over 550
organizations representing such interests as public and private sector
employers across a wide range of industries, non-profit organizations,
chambers of commerce, unions, and patient groups. We support the bi-
partisan Middle Class Health Benefits Tax Repeal Act of 2019, recently
introduced in the Senate by Senators Heinrich (D-NM) and Rounds (R-SD)
and co-sponsored by many others, including members of this Committee.
We also support the House version of the bill, which was introduced in
January and which as of this writing has 229 co-sponsors, with growing
numbers.
The NCCMP recommends fully and immediately repealing the 40% excise tax
on employer sponsored health coverage and also opposes any efforts to
tax employees on their health care benefits.

Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member and Members of the Committee,
Oxfam appreciates the Committee's sincere intention to ensure
affordable and accessible medicines for all who need them. We would
like to take this opportunity to bring the Committee's attention to our
recent investigation, Prescription for Poverty,\1\ illustrating how
four major pharmaceutical firms (three of whom are testifying before
the Committee at this hearing) may well be underpaying their US taxes
to the tune of $2.3 billion annually by systematically stashing their
profits in overseas tax havens. On top of these tax losses from
offshore tax avoidance, these companies likely benefitted significantly
from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA).\2\

\2\ Report of the Senate Finance Committee Democratic Staff,
``Trump Tax Law and the Health Care Industry: A $100 Billion Bonanza,''
April 17, 2018.
Here in the US and around the world, in rich and poor countries alike,
high drug prices are causing too many people to sacrifice their savings
or worse--their lives--to enrich executives at highly profitable and
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
influential drug companies.
As is well known, these drug companies' very business model depends to
a large degree on American taxpayer dollars: to pay for essential
front-end drug research, to protect patents and intellectual property,
and to purchase their drugs through Medicare, and the Veteran's
Administration.
Yet, these same companies are undermining public trust (and their very
own business model) by steadily under-paying their taxes, in the US and
around the world. Scouring the companies' financials, we've found that
four major pharmaceutical firms--Abbott, Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Merck
(MRK), and Pfizer (PFE)--alone appear to have deprived rich and poor
countries alike of around $3.7 billion of vital revenue that could have
been spent on vaccines, midwives, or health clinics. Because the
companies reveal little financial information about their subsidiaries,
Oxfam's investigation barely scratches the surface. Yet even a small
sampling reveals a striking degree of tax avoidance through profit-
shifting.
As the largest market for the four pharmaceutical companies, the United
States is the biggest loser from tax avoidance by these companies, to
the tune of an estimated $2.3 billion a year: $1 billion by JNJ, $589
million by Pfizer, $533 million by Merck, and $143 million by Abbott.
Together, this is enough to pay for health insurance for nearly a
million low-income children in the US.
How are companies avoiding their tax responsibilities?
Oxfam examined publicly available data on subsidiaries of four of the
largest US drug companies and found a striking pattern. In the
countries analyzed with standard corporate tax rates, the companies
reported low pre-tax profits--7 percent profits on average in high-
income countries, and 5 percent on average in seven low- and middle-
income countries. In contrast, these corporations reported annual
global profits of up to 30 percent. So, where were these companies
reporting such sky-high profits? Tax havens. In four countries which
charge very low or no corporate tax rates, these companies posted 31
percent profit margins--suggesting that the companies are artificially
shifting their profits to avoid paying taxes in countries with higher
tax rates.
In the case of the pharmaceutical giants, the ploy may involve
``domiciling'' their patent, not in the corporation's home country
where the drug was actually developed, but in a tax haven-where a
company's presence may be as little as a mailbox. That subsidiary then
charges hefty licensing fees to subsidiaries in other countries. The
fees are a tax deductible expense in the normal jurisdictions, meaning
that they can be used to offset any earnings and thereby lower the
reported profits. At the same time, the fee income accrues to the
subsidiary in the tax haven, where it is taxed lightly or not at all.
The company's overall tax payment then is lowered, sometimes
significantly.
Another technique many companies have used is to sell their production
or services not directly to the countries where they will be consumed,
but to ``pivot'' companies in low tax jurisdictions that then resell
them at a profit to affiliated distributors. This practice creates an
artificial profit that remains in the tax haven. Most of the time,
these are only paper transactions--the goods are shipped straight from
the factory in the production country to the warehouse in the
consumption country--but the transactions allow profits to move from
one country to another almost tax-free.
Because companies refuse to release their full country-by-country
financial reports to the public, and many governments have yet to make
these reports public, the information on tax dodging is far from
complete. Yet, the pattern of Big Pharma's tax practices is consistent:
this is either an astounding coincidence or the result of using
accounting tricks to deliberately shift profits from where they are
actually earned to tax havens. Pfizer, Merck, and Abbott are among the
20 US corporations with the greatest number of subsidiaries in tax
havens; Johnson & Johnson is not far behind. While profits can vary
from country to country for any number of legitimate reasons, it is
highly unlikely that these explanations can fully account for the
consistent pattern of much higher profits being posted in countries
with very low tax rates where these corporations do not sell the
majority of their medicines.
Tax injustice and price gouging are two sides of the same coin
Tax avoidance and price gouging are not, in fact, completely
independent phenomena. Today's hearing provides a timely opportunity to
connect the dots between high drug prices and unjust tax avoidance
practices which deprive the US Treasury of precious public revenue
needed to fund essential public health programs in the US. Every tax
dollar avoided means a tax dollar less for new drug research at the
National Institutes of Health, and for essential health insurance
programs like Medicaid, Medicare and the Child's Health Insurance
Program.
What's more, as we detail in our report cited above, a cornerstone of
these companies' business model--the intellectual property rules
protecting many of these pharmaceutical companies' most profitable
products--is a central factor in allowing these companies to drive up
drug prices, while driving down their tax payments. And conversely, our
tax system at present incentivizes price hikes in a variety of ways.
While the specific solutions to drug pricing and tax avoidance are
distinct, there are some essential common approaches in our view.
Global companies should be transparent about where they earn and spend
their money, they should pay tax in alignment with actual economic
activity rather than abuse our tax system in a variety of ways, and
they should use their political influence responsibly, rather than
undermining governments' efforts to provide essential medicines and
healthcare for us all.
------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In this context, we would encourage the Senate Committee to raise the
following questions to JNJ, PFE and MRK during the February 26th
hearing:
1. According to evidence received, your companies systematically report
low pre-tax profits in high-tax countries, and high pre-tax profits in
low-tax countries: reportedly resulting in billions of dollars of lost
revenue in the US which could have been spent on new drug research or
to fund essential healthcare. Can you explain why these aggressive tax
planning practices serve the public interest?
2. Is your company involved in offshore tax avoidance? If so, please
explain why you believe this is acceptable practice. Can you commit to
publicly releasing your company's country-by-country financial reports
to show and prove your tax practices meet social expectations?
3. How has your company invested the fresh cash resulting from the
passage of the TCJA? Very concretely, can you explain how these
expenditures are working to drive down drug prices? If they are not
doing so, why not?

Patients for Affordable Drugs Now
Statement by David Mitchell, Founder
Chairman Grassley, Ranking Member Wyden, and members of the Senate
Finance Committee,
Thank you for your leadership to address the problem of high drug
prices in America. U.S. patients and taxpayers spend more than $450
billion \1\ each year on prescription drugs. By some estimates, nearly
one-fifth \2\ of all health care costs go toward prescription drugs.
The main driver of prescription drug spending is patent-protected
brand-name drugs, which make up only about 10 percent \3\ of
prescriptions but account for three-quarters of drug spending.\4\

That's why today's hearing is so important. You have called CEOs of
seven major drug corporations before the Senate Finance Committee to
explain their pricing practices, patent thickets and the fact that
American patients and taxpayers pay anywhere from two to six times \5\
more than the rest of the world for brand name prescription drugs.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

We hear every day from patients suffering under the high cost of
prescription drugs--cutting pills in half, choosing between groceries
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
and medication, and simply going without.
Patients have questions for the CEOs in front of you today, and we hope
Congress will ask them.
AbbVie Inc,
About AbbVie: AbbVie's anti-inflammatory drug Humira is the top-selling
\6\ drug in the world. The drug company doubled the price \7\ from
about $19,000 per year in 2012 to $38,000 per year in 2018. AbbVie
secured over 100 patents \8\ on Humira, ensuring that patent thickets
will keep competition off the U.S. market, while the company cut the
price in Europe by 80 percent \9\ for the exact same drug.

Patient Stories:

James Baer from Aurora, CO: ``I have seropositive degenerative
rheumatoid arthritis, and am on a regimen of high cost drugs. Humira is
the most expensive, at $4,500-$6,500 a month. My insurance, Humana, is
refusing to pay for it starting next month. My doctor says I need it to
win my fight against this genetic defect.''

Jacquie from Iowa: ``Since my Crohn's diagnosis, I've taken
Lialda and Humira. Both drugs would have been astronomical if I hadn't
been for my good insurance and eligibility for the pharmacy savings
programs for each. I have been lucky. But I am always constantly
worried about no longer being able to work due to my health, or losing
my health insurance, making these essential drugs unaffordable.''

Sherry from North Carolina: ``I am unable to afford the biologic
Humira even on Medicare. My monthly copay went from $5/month to $1,200/
month.''
Pfizer
About Pfizer: Pfizer's history of price hikes is as staggering as it is
long. Here's a look at the last three years: In 2017,\12\ Pfizer raised
the price of 91 drugs by 20 percent--that was nearly 10 times the rate
of inflation. In mid-2018,\13\ Pfizer announced price hikes on about
100 prescription drugs. After temporary freezes, Pfizer raised the

Jerraline Krawetzki from Berlin Heights, OH: ``Because of
diabetes type 2, Lantus and Humalog are required. Because of the
increased costs of these medications, after filling the first
prescriptions, already IN the donut hole. This means a one month
prescription of these 2 drugs, will cost over $600 per month. Senior
citizens on a fixed income cannot afford this.''

David from Nevada: ``I have to take Lantus and Januvia for my
Diabetes and Xeralto for my AFIB and many other medications for my
heart, blood pressure, cholesterol, and BPH. These medications are very
expensive and I can't afford them after I reach the Medicare Part D

AstraZeneca
About AstraZeneca: AstraZeneca has a history of charging cancer
patients high prices. Here are three examples: Imfinzi costs $180,000

high cholesterol drug, Crestor, the company raised prices multiple
times, including by about 15 percent \33\ right before a generic
competitor came to market.

200's is Crestor. It is not covered by our insurances and thus is out
of our reach. Sadly, we are both RNs and see others also go through
this. We are college educated, helping people, always gainfully
employed full time, but we are apparently disposable.''

Linda Schoene from Pikesville, MD said: ``I have GERD and am
prescribed Nexium. On Medicare Part D, my copay is a little over $100
per month. I can't afford that. So I go without which causes me sharp
pains in my stomach when I have a flair. I sometimes buy the over the
counter version, but it is half the strength of what I am prescribed
and doesn't treat my symptoms.''

Silvio from Pennsylvania: ``I was taking Crestor but the prices
kept rising and because I am on Medicare I was not eligible for a
discount. So I had to stop taking it. Next time I got a blood test my
bad cholesterol skyrocketed.''

Pharmaceutical Care Management Association
325 7th Street, NW, Suite 900
Washington, DC, 20004
Introduction
The Pharmaceutical Care Management Association (PCMA) is the national
association representing America's pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs),
which administer prescription drug plans for more than 266 million
Americans with health coverage provided through Fortune 500 employers,
health insurers, labor unions, Medicare, Medicaid, and the Federal
Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).
PBMs are the primary advocate for consumers and health plans in the
fight to keep prescription drugs accessible and affordable. PBMs
negotiate on behalf of consumers, and work to keep a lid on overall
costs for prescription drugs with market-based tools that encourage
competition among drug manufacturers and pharmacies, and incentivize
consumers to take the most cost effective and clinically appropriate
medication.
By leveraging competition among manufacturers, PBMs save patients and
health plans $123 per prescription, and will negotiate prescription
drug costs down $654 billion over the ten years ending 2025.\1\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\1\ Visante, ``Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs): Generating Savings
for Plan Sponsors and Consumers,'' February 2016, https://
www.pcmanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/visante-pbm-savings-feb-
2016.pdf.
PBMs manage Medicare Part D drug benefits through insurers, either as
contractual service providers to stand-alone Prescription Drug Plans
(PDPs) or Medicare Advantage plans that offer prescription drug
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
coverage (MA-PDs).
PBMs are proud of their performance in Part D. PBMs and Part D sponsors
have kept overall program costs 30 percent below original government
projections, offered beneficiaries lower-than-expected premiums, and
generated high levels of generic utilization while providing broad
choice of drugs and access to over 60,000 pharmacies, all while
attaining a continually high rate of beneficiary satisfaction.
PBMs Negotiate to Keep Drug Spending Manageable
The most recent available data, which is for years 2016 and 2017, show
that the overall growth in spending for all prescription drugs has been
low.\2\ tallying 1.4% and -0.3% for 2016 and 2017, respectively. Drug
industry stakeholders rightly trumpet such figures to show the success
of private-sector negotiation in bringing spending discipline to the
prescription drug market.

Prescription Drug Spending?'', February 20, 2019, https://
www.healthsystemtracker.org/chart-collection/recent-forecasted-trends-
prescription-drug-spending/#item-start.
However, the totals mask the dynamics at work in different sectors of
the prescription drug market. Spending on generic drugs has actually
been declining, while spending on brands has been increasing. According
to a November 2018 analysis, for the previous year, spending on brands
increased 4% while spending on generics decreased 3%.\3\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, ``Prescription Drug Cost
Trend Update,'' November 14, 2018, https://www.bcbs.com/the-health-of-
america/reports/prescription-drug-costs-trend-update.
Further, the report indicates that while brand drugs made up only 17%
of total prescriptions, they accounted for 79% of overall drug spending
in the previous year.\4\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\4\ BCBSA, Op. Cit.
Data underlying the overall spending figures shows that manufacturers
have been increasing the prices they set for their drugs rapidly.
According to IQVIA data, for the 5-year period ending 2017, brand
invoice price grew at an average annual rate of 10.5%, while overall
inflation in the economy, as measured by CPI-U, grew at an average
annual rate of 1.3%.\5\ These trends are mirrored in a study conducted
on drugs most used by the elderly. A 2018 AARP analysis found retail
prices for 113 chronic-use brand name drugs on the market since at
least 2006 increased cumulatively over 12 years by an average of 214
percent, compared with the cumulative general inflation rate of 25
percent from 2006 to 2017.\6\

\6\ AARP, ``No End in Sight for Skyrocketing Prescription Drug
Prices,'' September 26, 2018.
The near-flat overall trend for spending on all drugs, despite rising
prices and spending for brands, illustrates the work that PBMs do as
advocates for patients and their client health plans to hold the line
on prescription drug costs.
Drug Manufacturers Alone Set and Raise Prescription Drug Prices
As the Committee continues its work with respect to prescription drug
costs, one thing is clear: only manufacturers have the power to set or
change prices. In recent years, brand manufacturers and their allies
have attempted to deflect blame for the prices they set by blaming
other parties in the drug supply chain,\7\ including pharmacies, PBMs,
and wholesalers. While much has been said and written, research studies
show that there is no correlation between the prices manufacturers set
and the rebates PBMs negotiate with manufacturers.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ See, e.g., https://www.phrma.org/press-release/new-report-
shows-how-supply-chain-shapes-brand-name-medicine-prices.
A 2018 study found no correlation between the prices that brand drug
manufacturers set for individual drugs and the rebates that they
negotiate with PBMs on those products (see chart below).\8\ The data in
the scatter plot below show that increasing list prices over a 5-year
period were not correlated with changes in rebates (R\2\=0.016), as
shown with the horizontal blue line. Additionally, there are prominent
cases of higher-than-average price increases on brand drugs where
rebates stayed the same or declined (e.g., Humulin).
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ Visante, ``Increasing Prices Set by Drugmakers Not Correlated
With Rebates: An Analysis Prepared by Visante on Behalf of PCMA,'' June
2017.
[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
At the same time, separate research confirmed that negotiated rebates
are correlated with competition-that the size of drug rebates is
positively correlated with the extent to which a given brand drug faces
competition in the market.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ Credit Suisse Equity Research, ``Global Pharma and Biotech,''
April 18, 2017.
Other research sponsored in part by a multinational brand drug
manufacturing firm reports that, for every $100 spent in the drug
supply chain on branded drugs, manufacturers capture $58. This
contrasts sharply with the amounts captured by pharmacies ($3), PBMs
($2), and wholesalers ($1).\10\ These results show that it is the
manufacturers who benefit far more than any other party in the drug
supply chain, and any rhetoric to the contrary is a smokescreen.

WhitePaper_Final_Spreads.pdf.
Further illustrating the lack of any connection of manufacturer list
prices to negotiated rebates is the chart below containing Part B
pricing data. Drugs under Medicare Part B typically carry no rebates.
The chart shows that several unrebated branded drugs have posted price
increases vastly outpacing the rate of inflation, as well as the rate
of price increases among most drugs. Moreover, unrebated drugs in
Medicare are not unique to Part B--HHS's Office of the Inspector
General finds a full 39% of branded drugs in Part D carry no
rebatex.\11\

* Estimated inflation adjusted price = 2012 price * weighted average manufacturer increase in list price per
unit. Not affected by changes in numbers of units per claim, or mix of doses/dosage forms. Estimated 2018
price through Q3 2018. During study years PBMs were not involved in Medicare Part B program, so no PBM rebates
were involved. Analysis included drugs with Part B spending data for full period 2012-16.
Source: Visante and PCMA analysis of data from CMS and SSR Health, 2019.
In sum, the research record is clear: drug manufacturers alone are
responsible for the prices they set and neither PBM-negotiated rebates,
nor any other party nor factor in the supply chain affects the list
price of a brand drug.
Managing Drug Cost Growth Is Challenging, but Policy Changes Could
Improve Competition
PBMs have an established record of negotiating with manufacturers and
pharmacies to reduce costs for patients, either in the form of lower
premiums for all participants in a plan, or through lower costs at the
pharmacy, and usually both.
The key to reducing prescription drug costs is increasing and
encouraging competition. PBMs are best able to negotiate when
competition exists, and PCMA's member companies support a number of
ideas for increasing competition and building upon market-based tools
to improve the Part D program. These include:

Remove Part D's protected classes. Designating ``classes of
clinical concern'' where all or substantially all drugs in a class must
be covered allows drug manufacturers to virtually name their price.
Indeed, a recent Milliman analysis showed that the average brand rebate
(for drugs that had any rebate) in Part D was 30%, while the average
rebate for brand drugs in protected classes was 14%.\12\ CMS already
applies careful plan formulary coverage checks to assure proper
coverage. A pending CMS plan only to lessen the effect of protected
classes-not eliminate them-would save $2 billion over 10 years.

Rebates,'' July 16, 2018, https://www.ahip.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/


Encourage greater use of generics for Part D LIS enrollees.
MedPAC recommended allowing the Secretary to lower cost-sharing on
generics and raise it for brands that have generic competition.
Allowing plans to lower generic cost-sharing for these beneficiaries
would save money for beneficiaries, taxpayers, and the Medicare
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
program.

Modify the requirement for two drugs per class. The requirement
that Part D plans cover two drugs per class is outmoded. It has
encouraged manufacturers to argue for ever more granular classes and
reduced competition, increasing Part D costs. Modifying the requirement
by requiring plans to ensure access to therapies based on conditions or
disease states instead would reduce costs without reducing access to
needed drugs.

Build on existing efforts to apply Part D management tools to
Part B drugs. PBM tools such as value-based formularies, manufacturer
negotiation, and prior authorization have proven indispensable for
improving patient safety and lowering costs in outpatient prescription
drug plans like Part D. Adding Part D management tools to the Medicare
fee-for-service program and building on efforts in Medicare Advantage
for Part B drugs would make drugs more affordable on Medicare's medical
side.

Encourage use of mail-order pharmacy in Part D. Mail-order
pharmacy: vastly reduces errors in dispensing; increases convenience
for beneficiaries on maintenance medications; improves adherence; and
offers a lower cost-sharing option to beneficiaries in most cases. With
much of the public using home-
delivery for a wide range of goods and with many Medicare beneficiaries
home-bound, CMS should take further steps to encourage home delivery of
maintenance medications.

Repeal any willing pharmacy provisions. Requirements that all
pharmacies be included in Part D networks drives up costs and are
unnecessary, given the network adequacy requirements. Congress should
repeal the provision. One study showed that greater use of limited
network pharmacies in Part D could generate $35 billion in savings over
10 years.\13\

Medicaid, and Commercial Payers $115 Billion,'' January 2013, https://
www.pcmanet.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/visante-pcma-pharmacy-
networks-study-1-13.pdf.

Give Part D plans meaningful access to Part A and B claims data.
To coordinate care and make the best coverage decisions for
beneficiaries, plans need to be able to use medical data as well as Rx
data. Existing prohibitions on using A and B data to inform coverage
design and decisions are misguided and keep plans from using claims
data to improve care coordination and coverage. Researchers suggest
combined data sets of Parts A, B, and D claims can be a ``rich
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
resource'' for comparative effectiveness data.
The following list of additional solutions would further increase
competition in the marketplace. While these proposals are outside the
Finance Committee's jurisdiction, they should help to bring balance
back to the drug marketplace and enhance competition.

Eliminate use of Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies
(REMS) to delay competition. Some manufacturers have used REMS to
prevent generic or biosimilar developers from getting sufficient
quantities of a drug or biologic to develop a competitor to the
innovator product. REMS were never intended for this purpose; this
practice should be prohibited. S. 340, ``Creating and Restoring Equal
Access to Equivalent Samples Act of 2019'' or the ``CREATES Act of
2019'' would address these abuses.

Stop anticompetitive product adjustments, i.e.,
``evergreening.'' Drug manufacturers sometimes use tactics such as
``product hopping'' or ``evergreening,'' submitting applications to the
FDA for approval of a ``new'' product that is essentially the same as
the original product. These product lifecycle management tactics
artificially extend drug exclusivity periods and delay the take-up of
lower-cost generics.

End orphan drug exclusivity abuses. Orphan drug exclusivities
are meant to encourage research on rare diseases, but manufacturers
have gamed the policy to apply it to blockbuster drugs with script
volume in the tens of millions. Orphan exclusivity periods should only
apply to those drugs originally approved by FDA under an orphan
indication and only for the orphan indication itself.

Eliminate ``pay-for-delay'' agreements. Patent settlements, or
``pay-for- delay'' agreements, allow drug patent holders to pay off
potential competitors who would otherwise produce a competing generic
or biosimilar drug. These anticompetitive agreements should be
eliminated. S. 64, The Preserve Access to Affordable Generics and
Biosimilars Act, would greatly ameliorate these concerns.

Allow for FDA accelerated approval of brand drugs based on
increasing competition. Accelerated review is granted to new drug
applications that address ``unmet need.'' The economic need for
competition to lower prices, or what some call ``financial toxicity,''
should be a criterion of unmet need.

Revisit and improve biosimilar labeling and naming.
Substitutable biosimilars should bear identical names and labels to
their innovator analogs. Use of different names will confuse patients
and providers and inhibit prescribing of biosimilars.

Reduce innovator biologic exclusivity to 7 years. Seven years of
data exclusivity would still provide a sufficient return to
manufacturers, while also speeding more affordable biosimilars to
market.
These policies and some of the specific bills that contain them can
help lower costs in Part D and the wider prescription drug market.
Part D Should Work for All Enrollees, but the Administration's Proposed
Rule Ending Drug Rebates Is Counterproductive
In addition to the suggested policy changes above, specific
interventions to help Part D beneficiaries who have high out-of-pocket
spending are needed. Fourteen years into the program, it remains a
great success with high enrollee satisfaction, however, policymakers
should consider how best to balance the needs of all Part D enrollees.
With respect to the Administration's recently proposed rule to end the
drug rebate safe harbor, there is grave concern that this proposed rule
would increase premiums for Medicare beneficiaries and costs for
taxpayers.
While the Administration's goals are well intentioned, the proposed
rule does nothing to reduce the prices drug manufacturers set. To the
contrary, it would cause substantial increases in seniors' Part D
premiums, as well as the cost to taxpayers.
The Administration's proposal also includes an unprecedented six
different cost impact estimates by three different actuarial groups,
including the independent HHS Office of the Actuary (OACT). The range
of impact for cost to the federal government across the six estimates
is an immense $300 billion. The great uncertainty surrounding the
proposal should give the Committee pause. Americans deserve clarity on
how such a proposal will affect those who rely on Medicare and
Medicaid, and commercial coverage. Given OACT's skill and institutional
independence from the agency, it is likely they have the most accurate
estimates.
Under the Administration's proposal, according to OACT, Part D premiums
could rise by as much as 25 percent for 2020 to reach $47.66, marking
the largest average premium increase in the program's history. Such a
large increase could cause many seniors and disabled Americans to drop
the prescription drug coverage they need to protect their health and
financial security, or never sign up in the first place. Healthier
beneficiaries (i.e., those who need fewer drugs) would drop coverage
first, causing premiums to increase further and potentially
destabilizing the Part D program, as increasingly those eligible for
enrollment would find Part D coverage unaffordable.
Additionally, OACT estimates that the proposal would cost the federal
government an extra $196 billion over the next 10 years. If finalized,
this could make the proposed rule among the costliest in U.S.
history.\14\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\14\ American Action Forum, ``Mandating Talking Cars: Costliest and
Most Beneficial?'', December 16, 2016. This article describes what were
at the time, the two costliest proposed regulations in U.S. history.
The OACT cost estimate for the Administration's proposal is in excess
of these two, https://www.americanactionforum.org/regulation-review/
mandating-talking-cars-costliest-beneficial/.
PCMA urges the Committee to encourage the Administration to withdraw,
or at the very least significantly delay the implementation of, the
proposed rule until its impact on beneficiaries and on Part D can be
better understood and managed.
Conclusion
In the search for solutions to address high drug costs, the Committee
and Congress would be best served in pursuing policies that foster and
encourage competition to keep prescription drug costs and pharmacy
benefits more affordable for employers, enrollees, taxpayers, and
government programs. Unfortunately, the rule recently proposed by the
Administration will not accomplish this goal, since it does nothing to
encourage manufacturers to bring down the drug prices they alone set.
PCMA member companies welcome continuing discussion among all
stakeholders to create a robust, sustainable market that will continue
to deliver needed cures and treatments for patients who suffer through
disease and chronic illness.

RE: The Escalating and Unsustainable Rising Cost of Insulin for
Insulin-Dependent Diabetics
Chairman Grassley and the Committee:
I hope I am not too late and will be read at least. I only received
this notification a few days ago from the American Diabetes
Association, but I see you continue to have hearings, so I am revising
and resending my letter.
I have type 1 diabetes. I am an insulin-dependent diabetic, which means
there's not one hour of every single day of my life that I MUST have
insulin, or I will die. It's that simple. I was diagnosed around 9-11,
sadly that it makes it easy to remember. I was an adult diagnosed with
a mostly childhood disease and had a lot to learn! The cost of insulin
that I need to stay alive 24 hours a day has escalated from $70 per
1000 ml vial to nearly $300 a bottle. The same bottle of Novolog sells
for $47.99 in Canada. I just had to pay $2300 out of pocket for 3
months of insulin (and that was with a supposed discount)! The
insurance I have through my employer has an extremely high deductible
and high copays and some items are not covered at all. If my insulin
pump supplies are not covered, I simply cannot afford them. If I can't
afford to manage my diabetes the way my doctor and I have been doing
successfully through pump therapy all these years, I will likely get
sick, get a complication or two and then die. And no one seems to care!
Certainly not the insurance companies or the pharmacies. People need to
care. It will cost far more with the complications that will arise if I
don't get my insulin and if I can't afford to pay it, other tax payers
will ultimately bear those costs when all of this can be avoided.
Again, I feel that most insurance companies and certainly the
pharmacies prefer their profits over actual health care and effective
management and if we can't afford the astronomical prices they are
putting on once affordable drugs and supplies, then they would prefer
we die and let someone else pay. This is insane to me! I should be able
to afford my insulin and pump supplies, as in the past, but due to
escalating prices of medications, insulin and insurance costs (so they
can all make their profits) it is becoming unsustainable. I can't
afford it and am very healthy and have a good paying job.
I would like to join in the battle to fight insurance companies who
seem to think we can do without these drugs--insulin is not even a
drug, it's something my body quit making almost 20 years ago and that
most of you all take for granted, but without it, I will, in fact, die
within a few days/possibly lingering a few weeks in a coma. I didn't
ask for this, however, if I am able to get what I need, what my doctor
prescribes for me and have that covered by my insurance, I remain
healthy. I am a working, productive, tax paying citizen and if you
allow me to get insulin and medical supplies at a sustainable price, I
can continue to be a productive tax paying citizen. If you don't I
become unable to work, pay taxes and get sicker and die. Diabetes is a
completely manageable disease and it's disheartening that the insurance
companies, the pharmacies and the United States Government seem to have
such low regard for those of us who were unfortunate to contract a
disease where we have NO OPTION but to buy insulin at escalating
prices. They keep raising the price of insulin higher and higher and
higher, because they have a captive audience they are holding hostage.
I really wish someone would take a stand on this and I would be willing
to help, testify, or whatever it takes to help this situation.
In addition, I also take a medication called Symlin that allows me to
utilize my insulin more efficiently. It decreases my insulin intake
about 30%. This helps me maintain a healthy weight. More insulin means
more weight and more weight means taking more insulin. It's a vicious
circle. I am a type 1 so I have never been over weight and I struggle
to maintain my weight for the reasons I have listed above. If I can
maintain my weight, not only will I be healthier, but I can take
slightly less insulin to help combat the astronomical cost of something
that I MUST HAVE EVERY SINGLE DAY OF MY LIFE. By reducing my intake by
10 units a day, I may get another day or two out each vial and that's a
lot! It certainly will NOT help my overall health to put on extra
pounds! Anyhow, my new insurance will not cover Symlin at all and they
tell me it will cost $5800 for a 3 month's supply that I used to pay
$70 co-pay when I had Premera. I have been on this drug about 10 years.
This is ridiculous and clearly, I cannot afford this, so I get to go
off it cold turkey, increase my insulin intake and pay more than I ever
have for the same insulin!
I don't think they understand how this all works nor do insurance
companies and administrators care, but if you give us the tools
(medications and supplies) to manage our diseases with, we will not
have as many costly complications. So, it is cost-effective to give us
what we need now to avoid higher costs of complications later! To date,
since I was diagnosed as a type 1 in 2001 and having been on an insulin
pump for 17-18 years, I have never had any complications due to my
diabetes and would like to keep it that way.
I am so disgusted with insurance companies and I want to know what we
can do to get things changed. Can I go up to Canada and purchase my
insulin? Can I testify and be a witness? I am willing to do whatever I
can to help! What can I do to lower my medication and durable medical
equipment costs? The insurance company cannot even tell me what things
cost until I purchase them, which is ridiculous since I don't want to
pay for things I clearly cannot afford. I'm lost and feeling desperate.
I look to your committee to make this manageable disease financially
manageable. It is manageable if we can afford what we need to survive
and there's NO reason for the price to quadruple in the last 10 years,
NONE except for greed and profits.
I spent over $6.5K last year on out pocket medical costs, mostly
insulin and pump supplies. I had no surgeries, I had no illnesses, I
had no procedures. This is becoming very difficult to afford.
I don't think I should have to struggle to afford groceries and lose my
home or just make simple choices because I can't afford my insulin and
supplies. Please do something about the escalating cost of health care,
specifically common insulin, Novolog in my case, and do what you have
promised for many years! This is unsustainable as it currently is!
Thank you for listening.

RE: February 26, 2019, ``Drug Pricing in America: A Prescription for
Change, Part II''
To the Senate Committee on Finance,
Thank you for beginning to tackle the outrageous prices of prescription
drugs in America. I've watched many of the meetings and also the
Congressional Oversight meeting with Congressman Cummings. I watched
this meeting again and took notes. What I find interesting is several
of the ``Magnificent Seven'' are foreigners. These are CEOs that have
come to America to use Americans and the American healthcare system as
pawns for their profits. I do think that it is a multi-layered problem
and the American healthcare system is to blame for a lot of it. The
first thing that the senate and congress need to do is regulate this
industry so these people have to abide by stricter laws. All of the
levels need to abide by stricter laws.
I come to you as a mother of a type 1 diabetic, 20 years old, who will
soon be on his own. What will happen to him if he has to enter a high
deductible healthcare plan one day? Will he be the next Alec Smith or
Antavia Worsham? I would like to see this system fixed before he has to
cross that road. I am lucky enough to live in the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts, where he is eligible for Masshealth benefits so I am not
taxed in my wallet for his insulin. But one day, under the current
system, he may be. What if he ever wants to move out of Massachusetts?
What kind of healthcare plan will he be forced into? The current system
is designed for failure for a T1 diabetic. The only way T1s can get
their insulin for free or cheap is to make less than $16,000 or just
work a part-time job so you will qualify financially. What kind of
contribution to society is that? Will he ever be able to use the
college degree he will earn? He might end up living at home for the
rest of his life to be able to afford insulin because he will never be
able to afford $324.00 for a bottle of insulin or the ridiculous copays
assessed and high deductibles. High deductible healthcare plans need to
be abolished. High deductible healthcare plans are only for the really
healthy, they're not for anyone who needs to use the system, the only
system in place. T1s are forced to use the system because insulin is
not available over the counter like a loaf of bread is. My son can't
buy and eat the bread if he doesn't have the insulin to go with it.
Why does America not allow insulin to be purchased over the counter
without a prescription? Why does America not trust Americans to use
insulin correctly? I want insulin to be able to be purchased over the
counter, maybe with a prescription, but no insurance attached to it.
When you look at the supply chain of food, there's a manufacturer, a
warehouse and distributor, the supermarket and then the consumer. When
you look at the supply chain of medicine, there's the manufacturer, the
warehouse and distributor, the pharmacy (supermarket), the consumer and
then the PBMS and insurance companies. If the PBMS and insurance
companies were eliminated from this chain, then the prices would come
down because there would be no clawbacks and rebates involved. Is there
a rebate for bread? No.
My son was diagnosed with T1 diabetes in 2007. I was looking at some of
my old receipts. I looked at one from 2010. The price that Blue Cross
paid was $390.13 for 6 bottles of humalog. I had a $60 copay. That was
$75.00 a bottle, but I only paid $10.00 a bottle with the copay. The
lantus insulin was $152.48 that the insurance paid, and I paid $60.00.
I got 3 bottles. So that was $212.48 divided by 3 is $70.82. I paid
$20.00 for each bottle with the $60.00 copay. Today, I see the receipt
from Walgreen's, and the cash price is $974.89 for 3 bottles of
humalog. That's $324.96 each. That is what the Commonwealth of
Massachusetts must pay because he is covered under Masshealth. Does
Massachusetts pay that much? I have a feeling they do because Medicaid
is not allowed to negotiate prices with drug companies. The budget for
Massachusetts is 40% healthcare. Former Gov. Mitt Romney put this
mandatory healthcare in place. This should have been used as the
template for the ACA. Did the ACA cause these high deductible
healthcare plans? Some people think it did. That's a question I have
for you. Did the ACA cause high deductible plans? High deductible plans
are bankrupting Americans. They're causing people to have to pay
upwards to $25,000.00 sometimes for drug coverage before insurance will
pay anything. It's unaffordable. People are selling their houses,
taking out second and third mortgages, moving back home with mom and
dad, and even living on the streets.
You've heard the stories about people rationing insulin and dying. I
don't want that to happen to my son. T1 diabetes will never go away.
There is no cure. The pharmaceutical companies know there is no cure
and know we are at their mercy. The American lawmakers allow them to
carry on. You need to regulate this industry and put the brakes on
their practices. Utilities, food, tobacco, guns, are all regulated.
It's time for pharmaceutical companies to be held accountable so they
will stop using Americans as pawns for profit. As said in the hearing,
they make money on their drugs in Germany. If they didn't, they would
say goodbye to Germany.
When people can go to Mexico and buy the insulin for $30.00 a bottle,
Canada for $35-45.00 a bottle, then that tells you that the price to
produce it is low. I read an article that showed a study that said it
only costs $3-6.00 to produce a bottle of insulin. It's just like the
EpiPen. Heather Bresch, the CEO of Mylan, she told the Senate that it
costs Mylan $1.00 to make it, they sell it for $60.00 and it retailed
for $300.00! That's nuts. A lot of EpiPens never even get used. They're
there for an emergency. Insulin is used anywhere from 4-10 times a day
because you need to take it every time you eat. You don't need an
EpiPen every time you eat. The equivalent to an EpiPen for a diabetic
is a device called a glucagon injection. It is also very expensive and
is often never used. It's an injection that will revive you from a low
blood sugar if you pass out and may have a seizure. According to GoodRX
website, the glucagon retails for $292.81 which is 19% off the retail
price of $364.50. This is another device that often goes unused, but
people pay for it because they want it in case of emergency. There are
no coupons available to get it for free. I would like to know how much
it really costs to manufacture a glucagon kit.
The other thing that people are doing to get insulin is they're taking
out gofundme accounts. They try to raise money to pay for the copays.
They don't always succeed in raising the money and still end up dead,
which is the case with a man named Shane Patrick Boyle. People then
have to take out gofundme accounts to bury their loved ones because
once you are diagnosed with T1 diabetes, you have a lot of difficulty
in getting life insurance. You're a threat to insurance companies. They
only want to bring money in, they don't want to pay it out. But they
pay it out to CEOs in the form of huge salaries.
All of the CEOs at every level of the supply chain make a lot of money.
David Ricks, CEO of Eli Lilly, he makes $40,000.00 a day in salary.
$5,000.00 an hour. Some people don't make $40K in two years. The CEOs
of CVS, Walgreen's, Rite Aid, Kroger and all the insurance companies,
like United Healthcare and Blue Cross, they also make millions. Why?
Why is that allowed? They've all created monopolies. I've watched their
stocks and they've all skyrocketed and I see a new CVS store in many
towns around where I live. They've closed the old stores and built
these fancy new buildings that are full of expensive products. I only
get my son's insulin at Walgreen's because I am forced to get it
locally, Medicaid will not allow you to use a 90 day pharmacy service.
And insulin isn't the only thing that diabetics need to use for daily
management of diabetes. They need test strips, meters, pump supplies,
Dexcom supplies, glucose tablet s, ketone test strips, alcohol wipes,
and sometimes they have to eat special food if they also end up with
Celiac Disease.
There are at least 80 autoimmune diseases. There is no cure for any of
them. Do you think the pharmaceutical companies think there is a cure
on the horizon, a vaccine? Is that why they're raping American's to get
their profits before people don't need insulin anymore?
Nicole Smith-Holt, the mother from Minnesota that lost her son Alec to
rationing insulin said this in a Minnesota Roundtable: ``Before insulin
was invented, diabetes was a death sentence. Now diabetes is a death
sentence again because insulin is no longer affordable.'' Let that sit
with you.
I have a change.org petition going around asking Congress to subpoena
the CEOs of the insulin companies. One of the signers of the petition
posted that this is the new AMERICAN GENOCIDE. Let that sit with you.
I like what Senator Wyden said about these CEOs using patients and
taxpayers as ``unlocked ATMS.'' It's the truth. I also like what he
said when he said ``drug prices are astronomically high because that's
where pharmaceutical companies and investors want them, and diabetics
who can't afford the costs self-ration and endanger their lives but the
investor s are happy.'' It's the truth.
The CEOs were asked `'What keeps you up at night?'' None of them
answered that they were concerned about anyone dying because they can't
afford their medicines. They all answered that they were more concerned
about their drugs being put on formularies. That brings me to another
problem. The formularies. The PBMS play games all the time with the
switching in and out of the type of insulin that the insurance company
will pay for. This means that people often end up getting a physician's
override to be able to continue using the insulin of their choice. The
formulary dictates to the diabetic what they can and cannot use. They
limit your choices or make you fight for the kind of insulin you want
to use. Do you have the choice to buy Pepperidge Farm bread or store
brand bread? Yes. So why doesn't the diabetic or person in need of
medication, have the ability to choose the one that works right for
them and not have to argue and fight for it? If the industry was
regulated, we may have the ability to choose what is right for us, the
patient and consumer.
Another problem I see and have stated this before, is that Congress has
to pass legislation stopping these pharmaceutical companies from
advertising on TV. They did it with tobacco. The last advertisement for
tobacco was for a Virginia Slims ad on December 31, 1970 on the Johnny
Carson show. Congress did that. So they need to do it again for
pharmaceutical. American and New Zealand are the only countries that
allow them to spend their profits on advertising. If they want to
advertise, they should only be able to advertise for medicines that
don't require a prescription. And I'm also tired of seeing
advertisements on TV for erectile dysfunction.
Doctors: Doctors need to inform patients of alternatives to getting
insulin and not having to use insurance. People are already buying
insulin from Canadian Pharmacies and going to Mexico if they can. The
State of Utah will actually pay their state employees $500.00 to cross
the Mexican border and get their medicines there instead of having to
put the burden on the state's budget to pay for expensive medicines in
the U.S. Isn't that crazy? Why should that happen? If medicines were
affordable, the drug companies wouldn't have to give so much away for
free. The burden would be shared equally and the money would stay in
America. And I don't buy the insulin companies' stories about the fact
that the insulin supply chain is not protected in Mexico like it is in
the U.S. If the insulin in Mexico were tainted, people would be dying
from it and it would be in the news that people are dying from it
there, and dying in foreign countries from it. So that is just a scare
tactic to get you to continue to pay high prices to support the high
CEO salaries.
Soriot--He said he was annoyed that he was the lowest paid CEO. Give me
a break. That is all part of the GREED before NEED and PROFITS before
PATIENTS.
The FDA--Mr. Gottlieb, the commissioner, he is a part of the problem
behind insulin as well. Insulin was classified as a DRUG. He went and
changed the classification to a BIOLOGIC. That's just a term for a
liquid medicine. So then that created the new biosimilar insulins.
After thinking about this, I figured out that the biosimilars didn't
make insulin a generic, all it did was allow these insulin companies to
take out new patents, patents that will have maybe a 20 year life span
under the Hatch-Waxman Act. So what does that do? It creates even more
of a monopoly. Why, after almost 100 years, is there no generic insulin
available? No one has an answer to that. The patent for humalog is long
since expired. All these insulin companies have to do is tweak an amino
acid in the insulin and they get a new patent. That's ridiculous to me.
Today, March 4, 2019, there was a news article issued about Eli Lilly:
https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-
introduce-lower-priced-insulin. In this article, Eli Lilly said they
were going to make a ``generic'' humalog and the list price of it would
be $137.35 for a vial and $265.20 for a box of 5 pens. That is
ridiculous to me. First, how do we know that Eli Lilly won't just use
the humalog as it is now and just put it in a new bottle with a
different color and change the name on it? Are they only doing this to
appease the senate and Ms. DeGette's investigation into these high
prices? Plus, they already have their BLINK HEALTH system, which is
like a GoodRX, that allows you to get a vial of insulin at $178.90 and
if you don't have insurance, you can get insulin from GoodRX for
$177.87. These prices are lower than the $324.00, but they still aren't
the $30.00 or $45.00 that Mexicans and Canadians reap the benefits
from. Canada would never allow insulin to be price gouged because it
was invented there by Sir Frederick Banting who has probably rolled
over in his grave a million times by now. I told my congressman, James
McGovern, that insulin wasn't supposed to be a FOR-PROFIT business. He
turned around to me, looked me in the eyes, and said: ``Well, it is''!
The other thing about the financial aid that Eli Lilly offers, is you
have to be really poor to be able to qualify for it. So only the poor,
nonworking people in America can get it for free. They wouldn't have to
give it out for free if it was affordable and accessible over the
counter at the pharmacy. They also give a lot of insulin way to camps.
Another thing that doctors don't tell people about is the 340B program.
That's like a big secret, just like the other secrets that revolve
around this industry. Many state attorney general's already have their
own investigations going on to find out what is going on behind closed
doors.
What I heard from some of these CEOs, especially Caforio, was that they
``need America's help and support'' to fix this problem. I heard that
from several of them. So they are asking YOU, the congress and the
senate, those that write the laws, to help them figure it out because
they know the system is unsustainable as it is and they will only
continue to do what they are doing because there are no laws saying
they can't do it. That's where my new hashtag comes into play--
#thepowerofthepen. Lawmakers are voted in with the power of the pen and
lawmakers can pick up the pen and write laws to protect Americans from
the greed of this industry.
I write to my congressman, James McGovern, and my senator, Elizabeth
Warren, and share with them what I am sharing with you. I share that
they need to take action and write better laws and regulate this
industry. They also have to stop taking money from the pharmaceutical
companies and lobbyists and don't fall for their antics. These people
are crooked and have the thief mentality.
Mr. Frazier stated that he couldn't walk away from the U.K. even though
they give lower prices because he believes it is immoral. But it's
okay. that he price gouges Americans and that's not immoral?
I read in a recent article about Mr. Brandicourt, that he fought to
keep any generic insulins out of the market and actually took out more
patents to prevent it. So why is that allowed? That's crookedness. That
is another case of Greed before Need. Companies like his, Sanofi, they
give out coupons for their lantus insulin. They wouldn't have to give
out coupons for people to get it for cheap or free if they just lowered
the prices and made them affordable.
NovoNordisk also gives out coupons and the same applies to them. Why
can they let you have insulin for $25.00 with the coupon, but you can't
go to the pharmacy and get the insulin for $25.00 without the coupon?
So you know the price to make insulin is cheap if they are able to give
out coupons for you to get it for free or cheap.
Senator Isakson, he had quite the story. He has Parkinson's disease and
takes 8 medicines. His story about all the ways he could get his
medicines for cheaper were right on target. The options: Don't use
insurance, use coupons, get rebates or just pay CASH. People could just
pay cash if they didn't have to pay and arm and a leg for medicines
that are supposed to keep you alive, not kill you because you can't
afford them. And his story about his staff member's 2nd child being
diagnosed with T1 diabetes was heartbreaking. T1 diabetes is an
epidemic. There is never anything shared on TV about the signs and
symptoms of T1 diabetes. Kids die from it after being misdiagnosed with
strep throat or the flu. T1 diabetes mimics the flu. My son had strep
throat when he was diagnosed. And it's not caused by vaccines. T1
diabetes has been around for over 4500 years and no vaccines were
invented then. People just died from it before insulin was invented in
1921.
My personal story is this: I have epilepsy. I take 3 medications for
it. One of them was invented in 1914. It's older than insulin. When my
husband had a great job with great insurance, I paid $3.96 for a 90 day
supply. When my husband lost his job, I was eligible to get on Medicare
because I am on disability. When I went to get my medicine at the
pharmacy, I was hit with a $114.41 bill. YIKES! This stuff is cheaper
than aspirin and here I am paying $114.41. The Medicare system, the
Part D, they put the medicine on the most expensive tier. So what am I
supposed to do? I have to pay it or my head goes nuts. Another medicine
I take, the patent doesn't expire until 2022, so there is no generic
for it. I just had to pay $1,200.00 for this medicine at the beginning
of the year. Ouch! My disability benefits are $1,600.00 a month. Do the
math. I wish I had never started to take it. The next time I get the
prescription filled, it will be $800.00 for it. I will never meet the
deductible set on my Part D plan because it is set so high that I never
reach it. So I pay over $300/year for my Part D plan, over 1,200.00/
year for my Part B, and even though the deductibles are lower than a
high deductible plan like a Blue Cross plan, it still hurts the wallet
every time I need to refill these prescriptions.
I'd like to share with you some stories of people that have children
with T1 diabetes.
1. This lady had a child die from T1 diabetes after the girl was kicked
off of BCMH at the age of 21. The girl rationed her insulin and was
found dead at home. The lady also has a second daughter that has T1
diabetes. She started a foundation and is on the warpath to make sure
people don't die from insulin rationing and get kicked off of health
plans. She just shared a story about her daughter being denied the
Dexcom continuous glucose monitor. People like her are always fighting
with insurance and distributors, especially Edgepark Medical Supply, to
get their supplies. This is a problem created by insurance companies
that ``don't want to pay.'' They will do everything in their power to
deny you and now people are turning to Costco to get this Dexcom device
and get out of the insurance loop to get it, and get it cheaper than it
costs to use their insurance. Yet, these people are still paying their
premiums and they can't use the insurance.
2. This lady and her son, they live in Tennessee. Tennessee, as I found
out, is one of the states that did not adopt the Medicaid expansion.
The son is 24 years old. He is a T1 diabetic as well. He was working at
a Hardee's burger place. He lost his job after getting sick with
diabeticketoacidosis (OKA). He was in the hospital and couldn't work so
they fired him. He had no access to insulin and started taking the
``WALMART'' insulin. This isn't the right kind of insulin for a T1
diabetic to take. He ended up with a big sore on his arm from injecting
the insulin in the same spot all the time. He ended up with a bad MRSA
infection. He went to the hospital and was not taken care of very well
and he checked himself out. He wanted something to drink and was denied
water. The mother didn't know how to navigate the politics to get help
in the state. She tried to get a social worker to get her son on
Medicaid. She was told NO, that he didn't qualify because he wasn't
pregnant, wasn't a single parent, and was over the age of 21.
So the message from the state of Tennessee is ``JUST GO DIE'' if you
can't work and get private insurance and you're over the age of 21.
``We don't want to take care of you anymore even though you have a life
threatening disease.'' So I contacted the governor there and got his
office to contact TennCare, the Medicaid office, and was able to at
least get him set up to get insulin, but he still has no doctor to
report to because he was denied care at a medical center there because
he missed three appointments and they won't take him because of a long
wait list. The option of moving out of the state is out of the question
I was told. So here is a man that will end up living with his mother
the rest of his life because he can't hold a job due to his diabetes.
3. A family from Texas. The father has a decent job but they live
paycheck to paycheck. They also have a T1 diabetic child. The father
was offered a TWENTY CENT raise. That means he would make $416.00 more
per year. Guess what? The twenty cent raise put his family over the
income qualifications to be able to continue to get CHIP benefits so
they can afford the insulin for the diabetic. The family would be
forced to take the insurance from the place of work. The insurance
would cost them $400.00 per month out of their paycheck. That means
they would lose $2.50 an hour if they took the twenty cent raise. Does
that make sense to you? The father ended up signing a waiver and not
accept the raise so he won't lose the CHIP benefits so he can keep his
child alive and not have to go get another job or try to come up with
the money for insulin one way or another? If insulin was affordable and
accessible over the counter, the $416.00 a year raise might pay for it.
But that's not the case. So much for a raise. I told the mother to tell
the company to give him a gift card for $400.00 that she can use on
groceries.
4. A United States citizen moved to the U.K. so she could get her
insulin to stay alive. What in the world? Are you kidding me? Cases
like this are what take money out of the U.S. economy.
5. A mother was on vacation, she only took one bottle of insulin with
her. The insulin got dropped on the floor. She came running to Facebook
to see if anyone could supply her with insulin because she couldn't get
a hold of her doctor to see if she could get her prescription filled
where she was. She couldn't just walk into any pharmacy and say she
wanted to buy the insulin her child used. She could do that if she
needed a bottle of water, but she can't do that with insulin. She was
frantic, thinking, how am I going to keep my child alive? The
pharmacist was not allowed to give her insulin without a prescription.
There was no emergency system in place. The pharmacist had no
authorization to give an emergency supply of insulin to this desperate
mother. In the end, she was finally able to get her doctor to call her
back and call in a prescription to the pharmacy to get a bottle of
insulin. That should never happen in America.
So I see people pay for premiums out of their paychecks, they pay for
copays at the doctor's office, they pay outrageous amounts of money in
high deductibles, and what do they end up with? They end up in debt,
end up with their own health problems because they are going crazy
wondering where in the world they are going to get this money from and
not have to lose everything they have.
Senator Stabenow was in a hearing that I watched and she actually said
she took people over the border to Canada herself to get cheaper
medicines. What does that tell you? That tells you that she's a great
person that will do whatever she has to do to make sure people don't
die at the hands of the current system. Our system is broken, it's old,
it out of date, and I am not 100% sure if this is all because of the
Affordable (Unaffordable) Care Act. I find that the people that make
these laws are not the people that actually have children with life-
threatening diseases and they have no idea what the cost of managing
the diseases consists of. If America is going to allow the
pharmaceutical industry to dictate to them how the system should be
run, then that is the wrong way of doing business.
I do think that the Senate Finance Committee and congress have to
subpoena these other pharmaceutical CEOs and get them to answer and be
transparent about how much it costs them to make their products. I have
a change.org petition going around getting signatures to ask congress
to subpoena them. You can't just invite them. An invitation can be
ignored and turned down, but not a subpoena. Heather Bresch had to come
to Washington to be transparent, so don't let the rest of them off the
hook.
Another thing about Eli Lilly: I read in the news that they were going
to buy an $8Billion oncology company. If they have $8B to buy an
oncology company, then why are they killing people with the high costs
of insulin, literally killing people because they just can't afford
their outrageous prices? They should not be able to buy a company like
that until insulin is affordable and accessible to everyone, not just
in America, but even in Africa. Why isn't insulin available in Africa?
People die from having no access to insulin there as well. Diabetes is
a global disease. You can't eradicate it. There is a genetic component
to it. People are living longer now with the invention of insulin so
they are passing the genes along to their offspring who ultimately pass
it on to the next generation.
March 5, 2019: This morning, as I continue to write and finish this, I
see a news article about Senator Durbin's response to Eli Lilly's
announcement yesterday. He acknowledges in there that insulin is as low
as $38.00 in Canada, but charging Americans four times the amount of
what Canadians pay it not an outpouring of gratitude. Canadians pay
less because their government negotiates the prices with these insulin
companies (http://www.kfvs12.com/2019/03/05/lawmaker-weighs-
annoucement-by-drug-maker-sell-lower-cost-insulin/). When will the
United States do the same thing? Why do you have to have a National
Health Care system to do it? Just regulate the industry, like gas and
electric, and start setting limits on the prices they can charge. And
the article says that Senator Durbin is urging the FDA to approve lower
cost drugs. There is no generic insulin. Why, after almost 100 years,
is there no generic insulin? Generic insulin is not the solution to
this dilemma. Just lower the cost. They've made their money over the
years, the patent for humalog is long since expired.
Like I said, Eli Lilly can just take humalog, stick it in a different
bottle, relabel it, and tell you it's a generic. The FDA can't regulate
prices. Let them be in charge of making sure drugs are safe, but don't
leave them in charge of this. Mr. Gottlieb went and changed the
category from a drug to a biologic--that didn't lower the price, it
only created new patent s. If there was a regulated industry, the price
would still be controlled on new patents.
Recap:

The drug industry needs to be regulated. These companies need to
be saved from themselves. They don't know how to do it on their own.

Insulin needs to be available over the counter without a
prescription. (Kevin's Law has been passed in many states to authorize
pharmacies to give an emergency, up to 30 day, supply of insulin and
the pharmacy and insurance can catch up with paperwork afterwards.)

The United States needs to trust citizens to use insulin
correctly. It's available over the counter in Mexico.

The United States needs to find out exactly how much it costs to
make insulin. The U.S. found out how much it costs to make an epipen.

PBMs need to be abolished.

High deductible healthcare plans need to be abolished.

If insulin is not accessible over the counter without a
prescription, then it should be exempt from any and all deductibles on
healthcare plans, as should any prescription medications.

No diabetic in America should be denied healthcare
(#medicare4all).

People shouldn't have to take out gofundme accounts to raise
money for their medicines.

People shouldn't have to take out home equity loans and second
mortgages to pay for their medicines.

People shouldn't have to turn to the black market and Facebook
to find insulin.

People shouldn't have to go out of the country to get affordable
insulin (#insulin4all).

People shouldn't have to share insulin with family members.

People shouldn't have to revert to using the ``WALMART'' insulin
which is going to kill them if not used correctly.

People shouldn't have to rely on coupons and scrounge around for
ways to get discounts on insulin and other drugs.

People shouldn't have to feel they are a burden to their family
and ration insulin.

Companies that price gouge should be held accountable, fined and
sued so they will stop being so greedy.

CEOs shouldn't be making so much money while people are dying.

Insurance companies shouldn't be able to dictate which medicines
and insulin they want us to use. We should be able to choose the one
that works for us. That's how the PBMs work. They tell us which insulin
they will pay for. If insulin was available over the counter, the PBMs
wouldn't be able to dictate which kind of insulin I want to use, just
like they can't decide what kind of bread I want to eat or if I want to
buy Mobil or Shell gasoline for my car.

The Hatch-Waxman Act is being abused.

The V.A. can negotiate prices for drugs and medical care, but
only Medicare Parts A and B can negotiate prices. Medicare part D needs
to be able to negotiate prices in an unregulated industry. You have the
power, use it.

Insulin doesn't need new R&D. Using that as a reason for high
prices is a bad excuse for high prices.

Television ads for prescription drugs has to stop, just as
tobacco ads stopped.

Politicians have to stop taking money from big pharmaceuticals.
The pharmaceutical companies are like the mafia.

If financial aid is going to remain available, the income
requirements need to be adjusted to keep up with inflation and keep up
with the times. People that make a decent, living wage, should be able
to get some relief if these high deductible plans continue to exist. If
you just got rid of high deductibles and the prices got lowered, we
wouldn't be talking about this.

Be proactive, not reactive. Right now we are in a reactive
position.

A sick person will always use the system since most want to
live. Those that don't want to live will commit suicide.

More teaching needs to take place in our country on what Type 1
Diabetes really is. It is often mixed up with Type 2 diabetes. They are
not the same disease.

The PBMs need to be hired by the U.S. government to do the
negotiating for lower prices, not be employees of the insurance
companies. That creates a racket and secrets.

Listen to more REAL stories of the burdens placed on Americans.
Let the Americans tell you what they need and want, not allow the
pharmaceutical companies to run their own agenda. Without sick people,
they wouldn't even be in business.

Put the brakes on big pharma.

List prices work against the patient. Either set lower list
prices or pass on the discounts to the patient.

Patients don't care about pharmaceutical's position on the
formularies, they care about being well.

Stop the ``Happy Talk''; get down to business and pick up the
pen (#thepowerofthepen).

Lawmakers work for the citizens of the United States and get
paid by our tax dollars. It's time for lawmakers to listen to citizens
and not big pharma.

Soriot's wise words: VBP--It used to be a system that was fit
for purpose. Now it's no longer fit for purpose. No one in the system
can fix it for themselves. The government has to step up and change the
rules.

#painpassionpurpose: Three words uttered to Nette Worsham by
Congressman Cummings on January 29, 2019.

CEOs from the two other insulin manufacturers, Eli Lilly and
NovoNordisk need to be subpoenaed. They have been invited too many
times and never accept the invite.

Don't send letters asking for CEOs to tell you how much it costs
them to make their drugs, make them come to Washington to tell you so
the public can hear their lame excuses as well.
Thank you, and I look forward to the next showdown with the PBMs and
insurance companies. They are part of the problem, not part of the
solution. The United States government is the entity that is part of
the solution.
Sincerely,
Laura T. Ricci

High drug costs: the tale of 4 women
In 2016, Berna Heyman testified before a U.S. Senate committee about
her personal experience with sudden and dramatic increases in drug
prices. She was forced to switch drugs to treat her chronic genetic
disease, which was not the ideal option for her.
``The only reason I changed was the cost,'' Berna testified. Her health
had been stable while taking the drug Syprine, which removes excess
copper in people with Wilson disease (WD) to prevent potentially fatal
poisoning. ``My doctor and I made the change only under duress.''
Valeant Pharmaceuticals (now Bausch Health) acquired the rights to
Syprine in 2010 and began increasing the price. It's an old drug that
was developed in the 1960s by British physician Dr. John Walshe, who
made it in his laboratory and distributed it for free for many years.
``It was cheap to make,'' he told me. The generic name for it is
trientine.
As a librarian at the College of William and Mary in Virginia for 34
years, Berna had good health insurance and drug coverage. Her WD went
undiagnosed for 60 years, making her one of the oldest patients to be
diagnosed. The first sign of her disease was cirrhosis of the liver
that was picked up incidentally by a radiologist.
Upon retirement, she was insured through Medicare and supplementary
insurance.
``By 2014 my projected co-pay exceeded $10,000 per year with my
insurance paying over $260,000,'' Berna testified. ``That is untenable.
Something has to be done.''
At the hearing, Valeant executives expressed regret and admitted to
being too aggressive with their pricing strategies. When questioned by
Senators, they said they'd lower their prices.
For 3 years, Berna has waited. But Bausch Health has yet to lower
prices.
``I left the hearing feeling hopeful, and anticipated changes by
Valeant,'' Berna told me. ``It's very disappointing. It's the same old,
same old.''
Therapist kept patients out of the system, but drug company put her in
it
Rose was completing her college degree in mechanical engineering when
she noticed that she drooled while reading. Then she began forgetting
math formulas, so she'd write them on her arm. As a straight-A student,
she was bewildered that she had to re-read book chapters because she
forgot what she'd read. She was on the crew team, but her fatigue got
so bad that she couldn't keep up.
``I left college and went home,'' said Rose, who asked that her name be
changed for privacy. After seeing more than a dozen doctors in New York
and not getting a diagnosis, she went to an ophthalmologist who told
her that some diseases can be diagnosed through the eye. He was right;
an exam revealed Rose had rust-colored rings in her eyes, known as
Kayser-Fleischer rings which are commonly seen in WD patients.
Once diagnosed, Rose began taking the de-coppering drug, penicillamine.
Her condition improved and she returned to college. But her WD left her
with some memory loss and she couldn't remember her calculus formulas.
She switched majors and got a degree in occupational therapy.
Rose moved to Arizona and worked full-time as an occupational therapist
for 20 years.
``Then one day I went to the pharmacy to pick up my WD drugs and was
told my co-pay was $12,000! I was a single mom raising two kids and I
couldn't afford it,'' said Rose. ``I felt totally screwed.''
She had been prescribed Cuprimine, the brand name version of
penicillamine--also made by Bausch Health. Penicillamine was discovered
in 1955, also by Dr. John Walshe. ``It's easy to make if you're a good
chemist,'' Dr. Walshe told me.
Rose tried zinc supplements, an inexpensive, alternate treatment for
WD, but they made her violently ill. Without her daily dose of
Cuprimine, her fatigue returned and depression set in. She could only
work part-time, so she lost her health insurance. Her WD symptoms
worsened, so she could no longer work and applied for disability
benefits.
``As an occupational therapist I was contributing to the system, and
keeping others out of the system,'' said Rose. ``Then the drug company
put me into the system.''
Importing drugs from Canada and overseas
After going without medication for months, Rose's uncle found a way for
her to get affordable penicillamine through a Canadian pharmaceutical
broker. At first, her supply came from England. ``The medicine looked
and smelled like what I had taken for years, although the brands were
different,'' said Rose. ``But then a shipment came from India that
didn't smell right.''
She looked for another option and found Duane, a prescription drug
broker in the Midwest who could get her drugs shipped directly from
Australia. She needed a doctor's prescription and paid about $200 for a
3-month supply.
``We operate in a loophole,'' Duane said. ``Individuals are allowed to
bring in a three-month supply of prescription drugs from other
countries.''
What Duane told me is partly true: It's illegal for individuals to
import prescription drugs in most circumstances, because the FDA can't
ensure the drugs' safety. And anyone who facilitates the importation is
also liable. But in reality, the FDA looks the other way.
So, it's tempting to take the risk. Duane imports an AIDS medication
for a client who had a $25,000 co-pay. ``I can get it for him for
$1,200 a month.''
With exorbitant drug prices and patients' growing inability to pay
them, there's momentum to make such drug imports legal. Five bills are
before Congress that would allow prescription drug imports, primarily
from Canada.
Staying at poverty level to get prescription drugs
Ashley Williams was about to start classes at Kansas State when she was
diagnosed with WD and had to quit school to go to work instead. She was
grateful to have a diagnosis for the hospitalizations and unnecessary
surgeries she experienced the previous 2 years.
``I needed health insurance, so I took a full-time job with a
technology company,'' said Ashley. ``I worked my way up from `coffee
girl' to project manager and was working 70-80 hours a week.'' Even
though she was taking Syprine, her health deteriorated. She thinks it
was due to working too hard, to prove she wasn't sick.
For medical reasons she got laid off and applied for disability
benefits. Now with Medicare and supplemental insurance to cover her
health care, she can't afford her Syprine co-pays.
``This year, I was told that the funds for Wilson disease were already
gone!'' said Ashley. ``The $1,200 co-pay for my 30 days of trientine
took my entire Social Security check.''
``A health insurance broker advised me to look into the PAN
Foundation,'' said Ashley. ``I qualified and get $10,000 a year to
cover the cost of my co-pay.'' The Patient Access Network Foundation
relies on donations to help people who are underinsured with medication
costs.
Patients have to reapply every January for the PAN Foundation's drug
benefit. ``But this year, I was told that the funds for Wilson disease
were already gone!'' said Ashley. ``The $1,200 co-pay for my 30 days of
trientine took my entire Social Security check.''
Teva Pharmaceuticals introduced the first generic trientine in 2018 to
compete with Bausch's Syprine.
Generic competition hasn't lowered the drug cost . . . yet
Dawn, who was diagnosed with WD at age 37 after her liver failed, was
shocked when she picked up her prescription for trientine in January.
The list price was $38,365.09. Her insurance co-pay was only $15.
Still, she's not taking her good fortune for granted, and is
stockpiling her drugs.
``I'm scared to take them all,'' said Dawn, who asked that her real
name not be used. ``I went without my drugs for 3 years because we
couldn't pay for them when the costs spiked.''
Ultimately, the drug saved her life. But they went bankrupt in the
process.
Her husband had taken a new job just before she was diagnosed with WD.
And then, just as their new insurance was coming through, ``the suckers
fired him,'' Dawn says. ``They knew I needed a liver transplant and was
really sick.''
She had no choice but to take Syprine, and ultimately, the drug saved
her life. But they went bankrupt in the process.
Bausch currently offers patient assistance programs to insured and
uninsured WD patients in the US who need Syprine or Cuprimine. ``Our
first priority is that every patient has access to the medicines they
need,'' a Bausch Health spokesperson said in a statement.
Dawn tried to get help from the drug company previously, but couldn't.
The inexpensive alternative, zinc therapy, made her sick.
Her husband eventually found a job that provided health insurance--700
miles from their home, in another state. ``He works 70 hours a week
hauling chemicals in extreme weather on treacherous roads. It aged him
so much.''
Dawn's liver healed enough so she could be taken off the transplant
list. Still, she's furious with the drug company for making the drug's
cost out of reach for 3 years. And, she's fearful it could happen
again.
How does the tale end for the 4 women?
Berna Heyman is encouraged that the problem of high drugs costs is
still a major discussion. ``That's the bright side,'' she said.
However, since she was forced to switch her WD medication, tests show
copper has reaccumulated in her liver. Her doctor advised a low-copper
diet for several months, but that didn't help. ``I may have to start
taking trientine again.''
Rose credits Duane for saving her life with the drug imports. But fear
of her supply line drying up led her to enroll in a clinical trial
testing a new drug for Wilson disease so she can get her life-saving
medication at no cost for the next five years. ``I hope the new drug
works,'' she said.
Fear over the uncertainty of being able to pay for her drugs also led
Ashley Williams to enroll in the new WD drug trial. By chance, she was
put in the ``standard of care'' arm of the trial. That means she
continued on trientine for a year and paid the drug's cost. ``Starting
in April, I will be taking the new study drug,'' she said. That means
she pays the $1,200 co-pay for her trientine for another month.
``It's scary to think that I have to stay in a drug trial to get my
medication paid for,'' Ashley said.
Even though Syprine saved Dawn's life, she's fearful that the drug's
cost could make it out of reach for her again. Her solution: Rationing
her drugs.
Perhaps this will be the year that the Wilson disease drugs Dr. John
Walshe discovered and developed more than 50 years ago will be
affordable again. But, the human toll and cost to society that the
drugs' price spikes caused, remains.

98-year-old drug inventor chastises pharma for ``behaving badly''
I've spent my career reporting medical news. It's an important topic to
me because I live with my own health challenge: A rare, genetic
condition called Wilson disease that allows copper--an essential
dietary mineral--to build up in the liver and brain, leading to copper
poisoning that can be fatal. It caused my liver to fail when I was a
college student. But I was lucky--I was diagnosed, there was a
treatment, and it worked.
Before 1955, my disease was fatal. Then, through a series of chance
events and serendipities, an English physician, Dr. John Walshe,
discovered a drug that turned Wilson disease (WD) into one that could
be treated and managed. The drug is known by its generic name,
penicillamine, and the brand names, Cuprimine and Depen.
While doing research for a book I'm writing on WD, I discovered that
Dr. Walshe is still very much alive and well at age 98. So I traveled
to Cambridge, England to thank him for saving my life and talk to him
about his drug discovery.
He invited me to his home, which is a William and Mary style house
built in the late 1600s, in the riverside village of Hemingford Grey,
near Cambridge. Talking in Dr. Walshe's quintessential English garden,
it didn't take him long to attack the pharmaceutical industry that now
sells the drug that he discovered and tested.
``The way they're charging for it now is absolutely immoral. There is
no other word for it,'' Dr. Walshe told me. ``It is totally immoral. It
is business at its worst!''
For more than 20 years I took Cuprimine and never paid more than $60 a
month for it. Today, it costs $31,426 a month making it the 13th most
expensive prescription drug in 2018.
Discovering the first treatment for Wilson disease
Listening to the story of Dr. Walshe's drug discovery, it's easy to
understand why he's incredulous about its cost.
The story began in 1954, when Dr. Walshe traveled to the United States
for a Fulbright Fellowship in Boston. ``I was working with Charlie
Davidson who was a liver doctor, and we were asked to see a Wilson
disease patient who had gone into liver failure,'' said Dr. Walshe.
They couldn't do anything to help the patient then, but crossing the
``bridge'' from what was then Boston City Hospital where the patient
was being cared for, back to Thorndike Laboratory where he worked, Dr.
Walshe had what he calls as inspiration: ``I said to Charlie Davidson,
`You know what this chap really needs is penicillamine.' And Charlie
Davidson said `What's that?' I told him I discovered this new amino
acid that had never been seen in human urine before,'' said Dr. Walshe.
Previously, while working in London during the early 1950s, Dr. Walshe
had studied laboratory samples from people who were given the
antibiotic penicillin. He observed that penicillamine--a derivative of
penicillin--binds with copper. It's a process called chelation. His
theory was that penicillamine could search out the excess copper in
people with Wilson disease, bind with it, and then remove it from the
body through urination.
Proving his idea
To test his theory, Dr. Walshe obtained some penicillamine from a
chemist at MIT. Then, he did what would be unheard of today--he tried
it on himself first. ``It didn't do me any harm and the next day I was
alive and well,'' he said. ``I decided if it was safe for me, it was
safe for the patient.''
Dr. Walshe gave penicillamine to the WD patient--who was in liver
failure at Boston City Hospital--and as he predicted, it got copper
out. When his fellowship in Boston ended, he returned to London with a
small supply of penicillamine to continue his experiments there.
``My father was England's leading neurologist at the time, and I asked
him to find some Wilson disease patients for me to try it out on,''
said Dr. Walshe. His father came through with a handful of patients,
and in 1956 Dr. Walshe reported in the American Journal of Medicine
that his drug discovery worked.
After that, Dr. Walshe searched for chemical companies willing to make
penicillamine so the new treatment could be made available to WD
patients as soon as possible. This was years before the start of the
current FDA drug approval process that requires costly and extensive
testing before a drug can be considered for marketing.
Developing an alternative
As word spread that there was a treatment for Wilson disease, doctors
started prescribing penicillamine for their patients. However, as more
patients took it, they found that some developed severe side effects.
So, Dr. Walshe looked for a second option.
``We had run into trouble with penicillamine, and I wanted an
alternative treatment,'' said Dr. Walshe.
By this time he was working at the University of Cambridge, and one
morning he ran into a biochemist named Dr. Hal Dixon. Dr. Walshe
explained his predicament, and Dr. Dixon pulled a chemical called
triethylene tetramine off his laboratory shelf.
``He said it was non-toxic and known to bind with copper,'' said Dr.
Walshe. ``He told me to try it, and that's how we got the drug
trientine. It was Hal Dixon's idea, and my work proving that it worked
and it was safe.''
Walshe made the drug himself
For years, Dr. Walshe and his assistant made trientine in their
laboratory until they could no longer keep up with demand.Dr. Dixon had
explained how to purify the chemical so it would be safe to use in
people. So, as he had done with penicillamine, Dr. Walshe searched for
a chemical company to make and distribute trientine. In 1985, trientine
became the fifth drug approved through the Orphan Drug Act.
``The trouble now is the people who make trientine behave so badly
about pricing,'' said Dr. Walshe. ``No doubt about it, they have
behaved appallingly badly about pricing.''
Univar Europe charges the UK's National Health Service the equivalent
of $96,000 to treat a patient for a year. Because of the high cost, the
NHS debated whether or not it could continue paying for the drug in
2019. The North American company Valeant Pharmaceuticals--now Bausch
Health--charges even more for its brand-name version, Syprine.
Investigating high drug costs
In 2016, Senator Susan Collins (R-Maine) launched a bipartisan
investigation into the extreme spikes that were being seen in drugs
that were off-patent. ``For example, the price of a Valeant drug that
is used to treat Wilson disease,'' said Collins, ``increased from $652
per month to more than $21,000 per month. That's more than a 3,000
percent increase in price with no justification.''
``It's monstrous, it's iniquitous what they're charging for it,'' said
Dr. Walshe. For several years he made trientine in his laboratory. ``I
sent it out for free on my basic laboratory expense allowance without
upsetting it. It was cheap!''
In the United States, Bausch Health now markets Syprine (the brand-name
version of trientine) as well as Cuprimine.The company acquired both
drugs in 2010 and, soon after, boosted the prices astronomically.
Despite extensive adverse publicity, a Congressional hearing, and the
addition of generic equivalents the company has yet to lower the drugs'
unjustified cost.
Walshe never profited from his drug discoveries
It's been almost 65 years since Dr. John Walshe had his ``inspiration''
while walking across the bridge at Harvard. I asked him where the idea
came from. He simply pointed to the sky and posed the rhetorical
question: ``Where do ideas come from?''
Dr. Walshe's discovery of penicillamine and the development of
trientine turned Wilson disease from a death sentence into a treatable
disease. Today, the challenge for patients is not finding treatment,
but being able to pay for it. Dr. Walshe says he never made any money
from the two drugs, instead devoting his medical career to helping
people with WD.
His idea saved my life. Now with the prices being charged for his
discoveries, will others be so lucky?
