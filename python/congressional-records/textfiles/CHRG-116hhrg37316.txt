VIOLATIONS OF THE HATCH ACT

Friday, July 15, 2019
House of Representatives
Committee on Oversight and Reform
Washington, D.C.
The committee met, pursuant to notice, at 4:10 p.m., in
room 2154, Rayburn House Office Building, Hon. Elijah Cummings
(chairman of the committee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Cummings, Maloney, Norton,
Connolly, Krishnamoorthi, Raskin, Rouda, Hill, Welch, Kelly,
DeSaulnier, Lawrence, Gomez, Ocasio-Cortez, Pressley, Tlaib,
Jordan, Gosar, Massie, Meadows, Hice, Grothman, Comer, Norman,
Roy, Miller, Green, Armstrong, Steube, and Keller.
Chairman Cummings. The committee will come to order.
And, without objection, the chair is authorized to declare
a recess of the committee at any time.
We are convening for part two of our full committee hearing
on violations of the Hatch Act under the Trump administration
to hear testimony from Ms. Kellyanne Conway.
I now recognize myself for five minutes to give an opening
statement.
Today, the committee was scheduled to hear testimony from
Ms. Kellyanne Conway, Counselor to the President, about her
repeated violations of Federal laws.
This is the second time in three weeks our committee has
attempted to obtain her testimony. We invited her to appear
voluntarily at a hearing on June 26, but she refused. The
committee then voted to authorize a subpoena to compel her to
testify here today. In defiance of that subpoena, Ms. Conway is
again refusing to appear.
Since Ms. Conway joined the White House in January 2017,
she has repeatedly and flagrantly abused her position of trust.
In March 2017, the Office of Government Ethics recommended
that the White House discipline Ms. Conway for using her
official position to promote Ivanka Trump's private business
during an interview on ``Fox & Friends.'' Rather than holding
Ms. Conway accountable, the White House minimized the
seriousness of Ms. Conway's violation by claiming that it was
made in a, quote, ``light, offhand manner,'' end of quote.
In October 2017, the committee discovered that Ms. Conway
wasted thousands of taxpayer dollars by traveling around the
country on private jets with former Secretary of Health and
Human Services Tom Price. Secretary Price paid the taxpayers
back, and then he resigned. Ms. Conway refused to reimburse
taxpayers and faced no disciplinary action at all from
President Trump.
Most recently, on June the 13th, 2019, the independent
Office of Special Counsel, which is led by Henry Kerner, who
was appointed by President Trump, issued a report recommending
that President Trump fire Ms. Conway for, quote, ``persistent,
notorious, and deliberate'' violations of the Hatch Act.
The Hatch Act prohibits Federal employees from using their
official positions for partisan political purposes. The law
ensures that the Federal Government is administered in a
nonpartisan manner and that Federal employees are protected
from political coercion in the workplace.
Mr. Kerner testified before our committee for more than
three hours about Ms. Conway's violations of Federal law. He
called them, quote, ``clear, repeated, and knowing violations
of the Hatch Act,'' end of quote.
He also warned that since President Trump is not taking any
disciplinary action against Ms. Conway, he sends a, quote,
``false message'' to other Federal employees that they need not
abide by the Hatch Act or that senior officials are above the
law.
Now, today, Ms. Conway is violating a duly authorized
subpoena issued by this committee. Ms. Conway is required to be
here today to address her multiple violations of Federal law,
many of which occurred on national TV.
Why is she not here? Just 25 minutes ago, the White House
sent a letter to the committee claiming that Ms. Conway is,
quote, ``absolutely immune,'' end of quote, from having to
testify before Congress simply because she works in the White
House. That is a completely baseless claim.
Our committee has heard testimony from many White House
officials under both Republican and Democratic administrations.
Examples include multiple White House Counsels, the Deputy
Counsel to the President, an Associate Counsel to the
President, a Deputy Assistant to the President, and the
Director of the White House Office of Security. This is a
clear-cut case.
We are not requiring her to testify about advice she gave
the President or about the White House's policy decisions. Let
me repeat that, members. We are not requiring her to testify
about advice she gave the President or about the White House's
policy decisions.
We are requiring her to testify before Congress about her
multiple violations of Federal law, her waste of taxpayer
funds, and her actions that compromise public confidence in the
integrity of the Federal Government. This illegal activity and
the ongoing effort to cover it up must not be allowed to stand.
This is bigger than just the Hatch Act or any other law.
This is about holding our government to the highest standard
and not allowing individuals appointed by the President to be
given special treatment when they flagrantly violate the law. I
must add that we have over 2 million Federal employees who obey
the Hatch Act every hour of their working day.
We hope Ms. Conway will reconsider, but if she does not, we
will hold a business meeting on July 25 to hold her in
contempt. I urge Ms. Conway to help us avoid this situation by
agreeing to testify before the committee.
I might note that this hearing was noticed for 4 o'clock
today, and it is now 4:27--4:18. It is now 4:18.
Our goal is to hear from Ms. Conway. If she does not change
course, we have no choice but to hold her accountable.
With that, I yield to the distinguished ranking member, Mr.
Jordan.
Mr. Jordan. Mr. Chairman, today's hearing is politics, pure
politics, orchestrated by a left-wing advocacy organization to
silence one of the President's top advisors. CREW was founded
by the Democrats' impeachment manager, Norm Eisen--that is
right, the guy Jerry Nadler hired to run impeachment for the
Judiciary Committee.
They targeted Ms. Conway not because it was looking to
clean up the government; they targeted Ms. Conway because she
is effective. She is effective at holding the press
accountable, cutting through the noise to explain President
Trump's successes and his vision for our country.
CREW knows that attacking a high-profile member of the
President's team will get them headlines, help them raise
money, cause the administration to spend time and resources
responding.
CREW filed the complaint with the Office of Special
Counsel, and the bureaucrats at OSC were more than happy to run
with it.
The report produced about Kellyanne Conway outrageous and
unprecedented. During the Obama Administration, OSC never made
a recommendation to remove a White House employee from Federal
service despite numerous--numerous Hatch Act violations.
And when OSC did flag this unprecedented recommendation for
the White House, OSC only gave the White House 16 hours--that
is right--just overnight, to respond.
The items OSC flagged as problematic are ridiculous. Ms.
Conway said that Vice President Biden and Senator Bernie
Sanders are two old, white career politicians. She said Senator
Warren was lying about her ethnicity and appropriating somebody
else's heritage. She suggested that Congressman O'Rourke does
not think that women running are good enough to be President.
And she said that Senator Bernie Sanders has ideas that are,
quote, ``terrible for America.''
Frankly, I think a lot of Americans would agree with Ms.
Conway's statements. But whether you agree or disagree with
those statements, it does not change the fact that they are Ms.
Conway's honest opinions and she has every right to share her
opinions.
Democrats on this committee are more than happy to use the
OSC report to attack Ms. Conway and, of course, the President.
And this is just yet another example of the committee, as I
said, being used for politics.
We had Special Counsel Henry Kerner testify for several
hours, detailing every fact about his report. This hearing
today is solely for the purpose of creating theater, political
theater, and advancing your partisan narrative about the
administration.
Mr. Chairman, you have said the administration is engaged
in a cover-up from the top on all the investigations. What you
failed to say, however, is this administration has produced
over 110,000 pages of documents to this committee and made
available all kinds of witnesses for transcribed interviews.
With the sort of rhetoric you have been using about the
administration, do you really think Ms. Conway thought she
would get a fair hearing here today? I don't think anyone is
surprised that Ms. Conway decided to spend her afternoon doing
her job on behalf of the American taxpayers rather than
subjecting herself to a classic Washington political theater
committee hearing.
And to what end? This effort does nothing to improve the
lives of everyday Americans, does nothing to fix the crisis at
the border, rein in the opioid epidemic, or bring down drug
prices.
This committee is always strongest when we work together
across party lines, but for the past six months the chairman
and his Democrat colleagues have chosen instead to take
political shots at the President.
Let's be clear: Ms. Conway's job is to advise the President
and serve as a media surrogate to keep the American people
apprised of the administration's views and action. This role is
necessary politically and involves her answering questions
about the state of politics in America. To suggest that in
carrying out her duties she ran afoul of the law is an attack
on her First Amendment liberties.
What we learned from Special Counsel Kerner two weeks ago
is that he was upset that Ms. Conway did not stop everything
she was doing, rearrange the way she does her job, and be
subject to a bureaucratic gag order pursuant to his office's
overly broad interpretation of the Hatch Act.
If we allowed the Hatch Act to be interpreted the way this
OSC wants, it would have a chilling effect on executive branch
employees that would silence both Republicans and Democrats for
decades to come.
I know that my colleagues and I would be amenable to a
discussion about legislation that would clarify the bounds of
the Hatch Act. That actually was brought up in our hearing when
we had Mr. Kerner here. But we are not amenable to this overly
broad use to attempt to silence a senior Presidential advisor
like we are witnessing this afternoon.
I yield back.
Chairman Cummings. I am disappointed that Ms. Conway chose
to defy the committee's duly authorized subpoena for her
appearance.
And I want to thank my colleagues for coming here today.
I hope the White House will reconsider its position and
cooperate with the committee.
The hearing is adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 4:22 p.m., the committee was adjourned.]
