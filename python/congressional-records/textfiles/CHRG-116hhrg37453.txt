ASSESSING THE HOMELAND SECURITY IMPACTS OF A CHANGING CLIMATE
----------
Tuesday, April 9, 2019
U.S. House of Representatives,
Committee on Homeland Security,
Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness,
Response, and Recovery,
Washington, DC.
The subcommittee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:11 p.m., in
room 310, Cannon House Office Building, Hon. Donald M. Payne,
Jr. (Chairman of the subcommittee) presiding.
Present: Representatives Payne, Rose, Underwood, Clarke,
King, Joyce, and Crenshaw.
Mr. Payne. The Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness,
Response, and Recovery will come to order. The subcommittee is
meeting today to receive testimony on ``Assessing the Homeland
Security Impacts of a Changing Climate.''
So good afternoon. I want to thank the witnesses for being
here today to discuss this incredibly important topic.
I am especially glad that the subcommittee hearing is
leading the Committee on Homeland Security's efforts on climate
change this Congress. The last time this committee held a
noticed activity on climate change, it was in 2015 when the
Republicans held a hearing entitled ``Examining DHS's Misplaced
Focus on Climate Change.''
Let me be clear: Climate change is here, it is happening,
and the scientific evidence is there, and it is a threat to our
security. If continued unchecked, the effects of climate change
will have a devastating impact on nearly every aspect of
American life. Scientists from all over the world are clear: If
we do not start taking steps to address this issue, it will
soon be too late.
As climate change continues to make extreme weather events
worse, our critical infrastructure will be at risk of failing--
a terrifying prospect for our homeland security. That risk is
increasing, according to researchers at the RAND Corporation,
as we see stronger disasters and an under-investment in
resiliency.
It is not just infrastructure, but it is also health care
systems, food production, military installations, commerce, and
so much more that are at risk--all things that are critical to
our homeland security.
With the FEMA work force already stretched too thin to
adequately respond to current disasters, there are serious
questions as to how they will be able to respond as climate
change intensifies hurricanes and other disasters.
However, instead of trying to incorporate climate change in
how it plans for the future, FEMA has stripped any mention of
it from their 2018-2022 strategic plan which guides the
agency's actions over the next few years.
But you don't have to look far into the future to see how
climate change is affecting us. It is no coincidence that 18 of
the 19 warmest years on record have occurred since 2001. The
world is getting warmer, and that is a fact.
Or take, for instance, Hurricane Harvey, one of the most
devastating storms in recent history. Studies have shown that
the rainfall during Hurricane Harvey, which was over 60 inches,
was as much as 38 percent higher than would be expected in a
world without climate change.
This isn't some far-off phenomenon. This is affecting real
people right now--the thousands of residents in and around
Houston who dealt with flooding and whose lives are still being
put back together.
In my own home State of New Jersey, we are seeing some of
the most intense warming trends in our country. In an analysis
of data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, New Jersey is one of the top 3 fastest-warming
States in the country.
Yet, despite these dire warnings, the Federal Government is
doing nothing to try to stop the effects of climate change. In
fact, it is making the problem worse by rolling back rules and
regulations aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
rolling back smart building rules to protect infrastructure
from floods.
Despite controlling the House for the past 8 years,
Republicans in Congress did nothing to address what scientists
agree will be the devastating effects of climate change.
Today, we have an expert panel of witnesses that can
discuss the science of climate change, why it matters to our
homeland security, and the effects on children, who are a
particularly vulnerable population when faced with extreme
weather events. I look forward to hearing their views on this
topic.

views on this topic.
Mr. Payne. With that, I now recognize the Ranking Member of
the subcommittee, the gentleman from New York, Mr. King, for an
opening statement.
Mr. King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I regret that I got here
late. I was over on the House floor, and there was sort of a
mix-up on when the votes were going to start. But, in any
event, I appreciate you having this hearing.
The bottom line is, from the wildfires on the West Coast
and tornadoes in the South to the hurricanes along the eastern
seaboard of the United States, no area of the country is immune
to the devastating effects of natural disasters.
But pre-disaster mitigation has the potential to limit the
negative effects of natural disasters. These pre-disaster
mitigation efforts by policy makers, individuals, first
responders, and emergency preparedness professionals must
ensure that no geographic region of the country is left
unsupported.
Mitigation activities include upgrading and strengthening
existing structures from all hazards, identifying sustainable
flood and erosion control projects, purchasing hurricane
shutters to resist wind, and managing vegetation to reduce
potential fire fuel.
The FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program helps
communities implement hazard mitigation measures following a
Presidential major disaster declaration to reduce the risk of
loss of life and property from future disasters.
To receive funds through this grant program, FEMA requires
each State complete a State hazard mitigation plan. New York's
2019 State hazard mitigation plan highlights 5 goals and
objectives, to include: Coordination between Federal, State,
and local entities; protection of existing properties;
increasing awareness of hazard risk and mitigation capabilities
among stakeholders, citizens, and elected officials alike;
preserving or restoring the functions of natural systems; and
to build stronger infrastructure.
Not only do mitigation activities aim to reduce deaths,
injuries, and property damage, they also have the potential to
limit the economic impact of disaster recovery efforts. A
recent report by the National Institute of Building Sciences
found that, by designing buildings to meet 2018 building code
standards, the National mitigation benefit-cost ratio is $6 to
$1 invested for floods and $10 to $1 invested for hurricanes
and $12 to $1 invested for earthquakes.
The report also found that impacts of 23 years of Federal
mitigation grants provided by FEMA, the Economic Development
Administration, and HUD resulted in National benefit of $6 to
$1 invested.
Unfortunately, our focus on emergency preparedness
oftentimes occurs in the aftermath of a natural disaster, which
is too late. However, as we have hardened our defenses
preemptively in the event of a terrorist attack, we also must
be prepared for the devastation of a severe weather event.
The reality is that natural disasters will continue to
occur. We should use every disaster as an opportunity to learn
and improve our mitigation capabilities to decrease the loss of
life and damage to our homes and infrastructure.
I would also say, Mr. Chairman, though, that I would hope
that, as we go forward on this, we focus on what can be done as
far as mitigation rather than get into a debate over climate
control.
I am not disputing anything that you said, but this
committee was established back in 2001, 2002, and 2003 because
of the attacks at 9/11. There are any number of other
committees in the House that do deal with natural disasters, do
deal with climate control. While we have a role to play, I
would say I don't want us to go too far afield. We have a hard
enough time coordinating our efforts against terrorism.
We always say that other committees are cutting into our
turf. We have always said that there should be a focus of our
committee on counterterrorism and terrorism. That can be,
obviously, expanded to white supremacist groups here in the
country. But it is geared toward acts of violence and acts of
terrorism.
If we focus our efforts going beyond what I believe is the
role of Homeland Security in meeting these natural disasters,
then I think we are diluting our efforts and really
undercutting the purpose of why this committee was formed back
in--I guess it was 2003 before it actually came into effect.
So, with that, again, I commend you for holding the hearing
today, but I do hope that, as we go forward, we realize that
our main goal as a committee, our main purpose from the genesis
was to focus on terrorism. I realize that has been expanded
now, which I understand. I support that. But I think we should
leave the debate over climate control and global warming to
other committees.
We can, let's just say, accept for the purpose of the
argument that everything is true, and then we should focus on
what the mitigation should be, rather than getting into debates
on how to change the climate, or prevent climate change.
With that, I yield back. I also look forward to the
testimony of all the witnesses, and I appreciate them taking
the time to be here today.
I yield back.

Mr. Payne. Well, I would like to thank the gentleman. It is
duly noted. I respect your concern in that area, and we will
continue to try to work toward our goal, which is to keep the
country safe.
Mr. King. Mr. Chairman, I have no doubt of your dedication,
believe me. I want that on the record clear as day.
Mr. Payne. Thank you. Yours, as well.
Other Members of the subcommittee are reminded that, under
the committee rules, opening statements may be submitted for
the record.
[The statement of Chairman Thompson follows:]
Statement of Chairman Bennie G. Thompson
April 9, 2019
The very real and sad truth is that climate change is upon us.
Unfortunately, under the Republican-controlled House, the Nation lost 8
years of Congressional oversight and planning for climate change.
As recently as 2015, Members of this committee were debating the
value of the Federal Government working to address climate change. We
cannot afford to have years go by where Congress sits idly by as
climate change produces more deadly and frequent natural disasters. A
changing climate is a threat to U.S. infrastructure, agriculture,
economy, health care, population, and so much more. This all makes it a
clear and serious threat to our homeland security.
During the hyperactive 2017 hurricane season and unprecedented
California wildfires, we bore witness to the unfortunate impacts of
climate change. Hurricane Harvey, for example, was one of the most
significant rain events in U.S. history. Through science, we know that
the increased temperatures caused more rainfall, and subsequently this
extreme rain event.
Science also helps us to understand that human behavior is the
largest contributing factor to climate change. Therefore, it is
incomprehensible that the Trump administration continues to roll back
regulations that help to mitigate the impacts of climate change.
Instead of facing this problem head on, the Department of Homeland
Security, as well as other agencies under Trump, refuse to even mention
climate change, as if not mentioning it would make it go away. We
cannot have DHS, who oversees FEMA, simply ignore a problem that is so
critical to our homeland security.
We have reports from the Department of Defense, the Government
Accountability Office, and even the Department of Homeland Security in
previous administrations, that have recognized this threat. It will
threaten our military bases and critical infrastructure, reduce our
agricultural yields, and make the spread of disease more prevalent.
Another sad truth is that low-income communities will suffer
compounded impacts of climate change. As a Hurricane Katrina survivor,
I understand the toll one intense disaster can have on communities--
especially low-income communities.
With it being already more difficult for low-income communities to
recover from major disasters, it is unfathomable to imagine how these
communities will deal with having intense disasters on a more regular
basis. More frequent and extreme weather also puts an incredible strain
on Federal resources; inhibiting response and recovery activities. We
saw this unfold in Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria, where by the
time the storm hit, Federal resources were stretched so thin that the
island that suffered from a subpar response, contributing to an
astonishing death toll of 3,000.
The Federal Government is already incapable of adequately
responding to the disasters we're seeing now, let alone as they get
worse in future years. We cannot continue to allow climate change to
intensify. We must do what we can to promote a cleaner environment that
can be sustained for generations to come.
Investments today in mitigation, that will reduce the future damage
of extreme weather events, is a smart down payment for our safety and
security, and this administration should be working with Congress to
make that happen.
Mr. Payne. Our panel. Let me--I welcome our panel of
witnesses.
Our first witness, Dr. Astrid Caldas--I am sorry. I did a
job on that one, didn't I?
Ms. Caldas. You are almost there, sir.
Mr. Payne [continuing]. Is a senior climate scientist with
the Union of Concerned Scientists.
Next we have Mr. Tim Manning, a former deputy administrator
of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and currently a
senior advisor to the Pacific Disaster Center and president and
CEO of Berglind-Manning, L.C.
Next we have Ms. Kristie Trousdale, who is the deputy
director of Children's Environmental Health Network.
Last we have Chief Dan Eggleston, who is the president and
chairman of the board for the International Association of Fire
Chiefs.
Without objection, the witnesses' full statements will be
inserted into the record.
I now ask each witness to summarize his or her statement
for 5 minutes, beginning with Dr. Caldas.
Say it for me one time.
Ms. Caldas. Excuse me?
Mr. Payne. Say your name for me one time.
Ms. Caldas. Astrid Caldas.
Mr. Payne. Astrid Caldas. Thank you. You may proceed.
STATEMENT OF ASTRID CALDAS, PH D, SENIOR CLIMATE SCIENTIST,
UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS
Ms. Caldas. Thank you.
Chairman Payne, Ranking Member King, and Members of the
subcommittee, thank you for inviting me to testify about
climate change science and impacts.
I am Astrid Caldas, a senior climate scientist at the Union
of Concerned Scientists, and I will focus on general impacts
and not on the military. The sources for our information are in
my submitted written testimony.
Eighteen of the 19 warmest years since record keeping began
have occurred since 2001. Many high school graduates from the
class of 2019 have lived their whole lives in a world of
record-breaking temperatures. The last 5 years have been the 5
hottest of all.
There is strong consensus among the scientific community
that global warming and climate change have been happening for
decades, are caused by humans through the emission of carbon
dioxide from the burning of fossil fuels, and that the need for
emissions reductions is urgent to avoid the worst consequences.
Two recent scientific assessment reports state that
millions of people, including here in the United States, are
already being affected by worsened heat, drought, wildfires,
flooding from extreme precipitation and sea-level rise, and
stronger hurricanes. Economic impacts are staggering. The past
3 years have been 3 of the 4 costliest years for climate-
related disasters in the United States.
Climate change is expected to make these disasters worse
unless we put all our might into reducing heat-trapping
emissions.
There were 13 extreme rain events in the United States
between May 2015 and June 2018 even though such events had,
historically, a probability of 0.2 percent of occurring in any
1 year. The type of devastating rain that fell in Louisiana in
2016 is expected to occur 40 percent more often and be 10
percent more intense now than it was before global warming.
Extreme rain events have become more frequent and more
intense, especially in the Northeast and the Midwest. With more
extreme rain, flood frequency has increased in the Mississippi
River Valley and across the Midwest over the last century.
Eastern Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey have also
experienced an increase in flood frequency over the last 50
years.
There has been an increase in the intensity of hurricanes
since 1970. A warmer sea surface and higher humidity in the air
provide fuel to stronger hurricanes, the latter increasing the
amount of rain they bring. The record-breaking rainfall from
Hurricane Harvey was about 3 times more likely and 15 to 38
percent more intense because of global warming. Storm surge is
riding on higher seas, and the area flooded by Hurricane Sandy
was about 27 square miles larger than it would have been in
1880, when seas were 8 inches lower.
Heat records are being broken much faster than cold
records, with California experiencing record-breaking heat
waves in 2017 and 2018. Global warming has contributed to the
severity and probability of about 80 percent of record-hot days
globally since the mid-20th Century.
Droughts are now occurring at higher temperatures. The flow
of the Colorado River has been reduced, and multi-year droughts
have led to massive agricultural losses in both California and
Texas.
Warming temperatures and dryer soils have contributed to
increases in area burned, number of large wildfires, and
wildfire season length. The area burned in the western United
States between 1984 and 2015 was twice what it would have been
without climate change. The Tubbs Fire in 2017 was the most
destructive in California's history, until the Camp Fire of
2018 surpassed it.
Finally, climate change can exacerbate historical
inequities. Socio-economically vulnerable segments of the
population face big challenges recovering from disasters due to
lack of resources and historic disfranchising. These
communities are often located in riskier areas, such as the
Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans, which flooded heavily during
Hurricane Katrina, or can't access resources necessary for
recovery, such as in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria.
Ignoring climate change will not make it go away or lessen
its impacts. Investing in climate preparedness will help reduce
future costs of climate impacts, and cutting global warming
emissions will help limit the magnitude of those impacts. Only
action can make it less damaging to our lives, our health,
economy, and planet.
Thank you.

Prepared Statement of Astrid Caldas
April 9, 2019
Chairman Payne, Ranking Member King, and Members of the
subcommittee, thank you for providing me the opportunity to testify
here today on climate change science. I am a senior climate scientist
at the Union of Concerned Scientists and in that capacity, I am here to
talk about climate science itself, and climate change impacts. I hope
you find this testimony valuable to your efforts around Emergency
Preparedness, Response, and Recovery
I will start my testimony by calling your attention to the fact
that 18 of the 19 warmest years since record keeping began have
occurred since 2001, meaning high school graduates from the class of
2019 have lived their whole lives in a world of record-breaking
temperatures. Furthermore, the last 5 years have been the five hottest
of all.\1\ These are all well-recorded data from various sources around
the globe and assessed by NOAA and NASA. Global warming is happening
right now and has been happening for many decades (Figure 1). The trend
is clear and is slated to continue unless we start putting all our
might into reducing heat-trapping emissions.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Global warming is caused mainly by the accumulation of carbon
dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil,
and natural gas. In addition to warming, this is causing changes in
countless natural and human systems that rely on and in turn influence
climate. For instance, among other changes, glaciers are shrinking,
Arctic sea ice is decreasing, sea level is rising, and oceans are
getting warmer and more acidic. Global warming and climate change are
two separate--but deeply interconnected--phenomena.

[GRAPHIC NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]
The science of climate change is very well established. Recently,
two important scientific assessment reports were released that describe
the current and projected impacts of climate change: The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Special Report on Global
Warming of 1.5C (IPCC 1.5)\3\ and the U.S. Fourth National Climate
Assessment (NCA4),\4\ mandated by the U.S. Government to be produced
every 4 years. Climate assessments provide the public and policy makers
with the most scientifically sound summary and evaluation of the most
recent policy-relevant research. It is worth noting that each of these
reports is the product of hundreds of National and international
experts from a range of sectors.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\3\ https://www.ipcc.ch/sr15/.
\4\ https://www.globalchange.gov/nca4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The IPCC 1.5 states that ``Human activities are estimated to have
caused approximately 1.0 C of global warming above pre-industrial
levels, with a likely range of 0.8 C to 1.2 C,'' and the NCA4 states
that ``Earth's climate is now changing faster than at any point in
modern civilization. [ . . .
] These changes are primarily the result
of human activities, the evidence of which is overwhelming and
continues to strengthen.'' It also states that climate change presents
growing challenges to: (1) The economy and infrastructure, (2) the
natural environment and the services ecosystems provide to society, and
(3) human health and quality of life.\5\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\5\ https://www.globalchange.gov/nca4.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is strong consensus among the scientific community (as shown
in the conclusions of the reports, based on thousands of scientific
research publications) that climate change is happening now, is caused
by humans, and that the need for emissions reductions is urgent in
order to avoid the worst consequences. The NCA4 also quantifies climate
change impacts in economic terms, providing an indication of the
potential for reducing risks through mitigation actions. The report
concludes that these climate-related impacts will only get worse and
their costs will mount dramatically if carbon emissions continue
unabated. Annual losses in some sectors are projected to exceed $100
billion by the end of the century and surpass the gross domestic
product of many States.
Both reports state that millions of people are already being
affected on their everyday lives by worsened heat, drought, wildfires,
flooding from both extreme precipitation and sea level rise, stronger
hurricanes, and more. The economic impacts and costs of these disasters
are staggering. The past 3 years have been 3 of the 4 costliest years
for climate-related disasters here in the United States (Figure 2). Two
thousand eighteen was the fourth-highest year for both the number and
costs of declared disasters. Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Maria, and the
California wildfires created unprecedented demand for Federal disaster
help in 2017. The Federal Government has provided at least $120 billion
in supplemental funding for these disasters, as well as help with
response and recovery.\6\

As the Government Accountability Office points out,\7\ in light of
growing extreme weather and climate-related disaster costs, the Federal
Government must invest ahead of time to help communities prepare
instead of just in recovery after disasters strike. A recent study \8\
shows the Nation can save $6 in future disaster costs, for every $1
spent on pre-hazard mitigation. Investing in climate resilience would
help reduce future costs of climate impacts and cutting global warming
emissions would help limit the magnitude of those impacts.

In the past few years the science has advanced to a point where the
proportion of climate change that contributed to the severity and
probability of individual extreme events is now possible.\9\ The
science of attribution tells us that certain types of extreme events
have been made more intense and/or more likely by climate change
(Figure 3). There is strong evidence suggesting that extreme
precipitation (including rain from hurricanes), coastal flooding (from
high tides and storm surge), and heat waves are influenced by climate
change. We will look at some examples.

extreme rainfall
Studies have shown that extreme precipitation events have become
more frequent and more intense in many parts of the United States since
the early to mid-1900's, with the eastern half of the country seeing
increases of 50 percent or more in extreme rainfall event frequency and
the western half seeing smaller increases or even decreases. The amount
of rain falling in the heaviest events is also increasing, especially
in the Northeast (Figure 4). Warmer air holds more moisture (in the
form of water vapor), and more moisture means more water can fall as
rain. This is one reason, all else being equal, a storm occurring in
very hot air can bring more precipitation than the exact same storm
would in cooler air.

Rain events once considered rare are now occurring more often than
historical records would lead us to expect. For example, the U.S.
National Weather Service recorded 13 rare rain events (not including
hurricanes) between May 2015 and June 2018 even though such events had
a 0.2 percent probability of occurring in any 1 year.\12\ All of these
events led to flooding.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Analyses of specific rain events are bringing to light the
connection between human-induced warming and extreme precipitation.
Human-caused climate change made the record-breaking rainfall during
Hurricane Harvey in 2017 about three times more likely and 15-38
percent more intense,\13\ \14\ and a study of the devastating rains in
Louisiana in 2016--in which more than 2 feet of rain fell in a 2-day
period--concluded that such downpours are expected to occur 40 percent
more often and be 10 percent more intense now than they were before the
Industrial Revolution and global warming.\15\

flooding
More volume of rainfall falling in the heaviest events for a region
typically leads to flooding. Data from gauges in rivers and streams
consistently show that flood frequency has increased in the Mississippi
River valley and across the Midwest over the last century. Similarly,
parts of the Northeast--eastern Pennsylvania, New York, and New Jersey
in particular--has experienced an increase in flood frequency over the
last 50 years (Figure 5). These regions are mostly seeing more floods,
not necessarily more severe floods, although some increase in moderate
and major flood frequency risk has occurred, especially in the Midwest.

hurricanes
Recent research suggests that there has been an increase in intense
hurricane activity in the North Atlantic since the 1970's. With global
warming, there will likely be more intense hurricanes, whose impacts
are likely to be exacerbated by sea level rise. Increases in population
density along the coast also increases the destructive potential of
hurricanes. The Congressional Budget Office, in a report on potential
increase in hurricane damage, stated that between 2000 and 2010 the
population of counties susceptible to hurricane damage grew 22 percent
faster than the overall U.S. population.\17\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\17\ https://www.cbo.gov/publication/51518.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hurricanes can form when surface ocean temperatures exceed about
79F (26 C). The rising of warm, moist air from the ocean helps to
power the storm. Oceans absorb most of the warming in the atmosphere,
and since 1970, sea surface temperatures world-wide have warmed by
about an average of 0.1 C per decade, which provides additional fuel
to hurricanes. Hurricanes also require high humidity, and since warmer
air can hold more water vapor, that also helps fuel hurricanes--and
increase the amount of rain they bring (see Figure 6).
The impact of a hurricane's storm surge can be worse now than in
the late 19th Century, because sea level has risen by 8 inches since
then, mainly due to global warming. In fact, the area flooded by
Hurricane Sandy in 2012 was about 27 square miles larger than it would
have been if the hurricane hit in 1880, mainly because of sea level
rise.\18\

extreme heat
With global warming, heat records are being broken much faster than
cold records.\19\ On average, hot days are getting hotter and cold days
are also getting hotter globally. In the United States, California
experienced record-breaking heat waves in 2017 and 2018, in addition to
several others since the then record-breaking wave of 2006.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\19\ https://science2017.globalchange.gov/.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Extreme heat is one type of extreme weather for which the evidence
of climate change's influence is strong (see Figure 3), and all over
the world heat waves are occurring more frequently. A study has found
that global warming has contributed to the severity and probability of
about 80 percent of record-hot days globally over the 1961-2010
period.\20\

wildfires
Warming temperatures and drier soils, important factors in
wildfires, have contributed to increases in area burned, number of
large wildfires, and wildfire season length. Other factors such as
wind, land use, and forest management also play roles in determining
wildfire risk.
More frequent and extensive wildfires pose threats to lives,
critical infrastructure, and property. According to the NCA4, the area
burned in the Western United States between 1984 and 2015 was twice
what it would have been without climate change \21\ (Figure 7). In
October 2017, more than a dozen fires burned through northern
California, killing dozens of people and leaving thousands more
homeless. The poor air quality as smoke plumes darkened skies caused
the cancellation of school and other activities across the region. The
Tubbs Fire, which burned parts of Napa, Sonoma, and Lake counties, was
the second-most destructive in California's history, with an estimated
$1.2 billion in damages, including the destruction of over 5,000
structures. The Camp Fire of 2018 surpassed it in number of structures
and acreage burned, and in number of deaths.\22\

drought
Droughts have always occurred, but they are now occurring at higher
temperatures, causing massive die-off of forest species in the 4-
corners region (trees that were centuries old and experienced droughts
before). California is suffering massive losses in its agricultural
system due to a multi-year drought, and the flow of the Colorado river
has been reduced due to higher temperatures.
According to the NCA4, during 2010-2015, a regional drought
impacted agriculture in the Southern Great Plains, with soybeans fields
in Texas severely affected due to the reduction of irrigation water
released for farmers on the Texas coastal plains.
equity considerations
Climate change can exacerbate historical inequities, environmental
injustice, and environmental racism. Disadvantaged segments of the
population already face big challenges recovering from disasters, due
to lack of resources and historical disenfranchising, and disasters
make these challenges worse. A recent analysis of U.S. Government
recovery programs showed that ``white Americans and those with more
wealth often receive more Federal dollars after a disaster than do
minorities and those with less wealth.''\24\ Also, a recent study
showed that ``natural hazard damages and how relief is provided
afterward [in the United States] exacerbate the growing gap between
white and black wealth.''\25\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Children, older adults, people of color, and fixed and low-income
communities are often at greater risk. The latter are often located in
riskier areas that may be more prone to flooding, such as the Lower
Ninth Ward in New Orleans, which flooded heavily during Hurricane
Katrina, or have fewer public services and resources necessary for
recovery from disasters. In Puerto Rico, when hurricane Maria hit,
almost 3,000 residents died, the majority for lack of access to medical
services.\26\

these front-line communities are identified and addressed.
action is needed on both adaptation and mitigation
Ignoring climate change will not make it go away or lessen its
impacts. Only action on both adaptation (reducing and preparing for the
risks) and mitigation (reducing heat-trapping emissions) can make it
less damaging to our lives, our health, our economy, and our planet.
Thank you for this opportunity to speak with you today. I look
forward to your questions.

STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY MANNING, SENIOR ADVISOR, PACIFIC DISASTER
CENTER, AND PRESIDENT AND CEO, BERGLIND-MANNING, L.C.
Mr. Manning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chairman Payne, Ranking Member King, Members of the
subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to speak with you
this afternoon on the impact of a changing climate on
disasters.
I am Tim Manning, former deputy administrator of FEMA for
Protection and National Preparedness, currently serving as a
consultant and university lecturer on disaster and emergency
management and global resilience. I appreciate the opportunity
to speak with you on this critical topic today.
Disasters are increasing with frequency and impact world-
wide. Two-thousand eighteen saw the fourth-highest number of
billion-dollar disasters, only behind 2017, 2016, and 2011.
The American disaster preparedness and response community
has made and continues to make enormous strides in its ability
to prepare our communities for the risks and hazards with which
they are faced. Disaster management plans, strategies,
staffing, response--they are all based in an assessment of
potential future crises that is in most cases rooted and
calibrated against an understanding of the hazards and
disasters of the past.
My great concern and consideration of the rapidly-changing
climate is that we may be significantly underestimating the
risks and hazards with which we are faced and the readiness of
emergency management agencies to respond. Without an overt and
concerted effort to account for the impacts of climate change,
FEMA and the American emergency management community will not
be fully prepared to protect, mitigate, and respond to the
threats facing the Nation.
We know a changing climate makes disasters worse--more
frequent, more intense storms, often in places unaccustomed to
such events, impacting infrastructure, exacerbating flooding,
and even expanding the spread of mosquito- and other insect-
borne diseases.
A warmer atmosphere holds more moisture and results in
significantly heavier rainfall in shorter periods of time.
Heavy precipitation events in the Midwest and Northeast, in
particular, have increased by up to 50 percent since 1900 and
may increase as much as another 50 percent over the next 50
years. With this increase in heat retention comes warmer oceans
and the potential for stronger, more intense coastal storms,
including in areas unaccustomed to such events.
Shifting temperatures result in shifting weather patterns
in the interior, potentially resulting in greater or less
snowfall in areas, changing the spring flood risk and other
impacts.
Rising sea levels raise the base on which storm surge and
tsunamis ride, greatly increasing the potential inundation of
areas, as well as bringing frequent non-storm blue-sky or
clear-sky flooding to American cities such as Charleston;
Annapolis, Maryland; and New York City.
Changing weather patterns affect wildfire risk as well.
According to analysis by the National Research Council, we have
experienced an extension of the western fire season of more
than 2 months in a year. The average size of wildfires has
increased by 300 percent.
While many attempts to address the impacts of climate
change have been made in recent years, as you noted, Mr.
Chairman, in your opening remarks, the word ``climate'' does
not occur once in the current 2018 to 2022 FEMA strategic plan.
One argument is that the general philosophical approach to
emergency management of all-hazards preparedness, in which
agencies prepare for any hazard, accounts for any potential
changes from climate. But that belies the reality.
Staffing, budgeting, the number and scale of response
teams, equipment, prepositioning, even response planning
assumptions are all based on an assessment of what worked or
didn't in previous disasters. Underestimating the severity,
frequency, or possible location of disasters will result in
organizations under-resourced for the mission at hand.
The strategic objectives of FEMA are laudable. In their
strategic plan, the goal of quadrupling the investment in
mitigation is an ambitious and potentially very valuable
effort. However, if this investment is made against the base
flood elevation model that does not account for rising sea
levels and increased rainfall intensity, it can likely lead to
poor decisions and wasted money and effort.
In 2015, President Obama issued Executive Order 13690
which, among other things, established a Federal flood standard
in recognition of rising sea level and climate change of an
additional 2 to 3 feet of freeboard for Federally-funded
projects, including hazard mitigation. However, in August 2017,
President Trump rescinded that order.
FEMA and the emergency management community is not likely
to be right-sized or positioned for its potential disaster
mission without accounting for a likely future that is very
different from its recent past.
The international community recognized this with the Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, to which the United
States is a signatory, by calling on nations to, ``prepare or
review and periodically update disaster preparedness and
contingency policies, plans, and programs considering climate
change scenarios and their impact on disaster risk''. We should
adopt this approach as well.
Mr. Chairman, thank you again for the opportunity to
discuss the impact of climate change on disasters and the
emergency management community in the United States, and I look
forward to your questions.
[The prepared statement of Mr. Manning follows:]
Prepared Statement of Timothy Manning
April 9, 2019
Chairman Payne, Ranking Member King, Members of the subcommittee,
thank you for the opportunity to speak with you today on the impact of
a changing climate on disasters, emergency management agencies, and
communities' readiness for crises. I am Tim Manning, former deputy
administrator of FEMA for Protection and National Preparedness,
currently serving as a consultant and university lecturer in disaster
and emergency management and global resilience. Thank you for inviting
me here today to discuss this critical topic
Disasters are increasing with frequency and impact world-wide. Two
thousand-eighteen saw the fourth-highest total number of billion-dollar
disasters, only behind the years 2017, 2011, and 2016. And over the
past many years, the American disaster preparedness and response
community has made, and continues to make, enormous strides in its
ability to prepare our communities for the risks and hazards with which
they are faced, and respond to the multitude of disasters impacting our
Nation. In the time between crises, tremendous work is undertaken to
build the capacity of our governmental and non-governmenetal agencies,
in staffing, training, equipping, and planning. These efforts, however,
and the targets against which success is measured, are all based in an
assessment of potential future crises that is, in most cases, rooted
and calibrated against an understanding of the hazards and disasters of
the past. My great concern, in consideration of the significant change
in the profile of disasters of recent years as a result of a rapidly-
changing climate, coupled with population, housing stock, and GDP
growth in coastal communities, is that we may be significantly
underestimating the risks and hazards with which we are faced, and the
readiness of emergency management agencies to respond. And without an
overt and concerted effort to account for the impacts of climate
change, FEMA and the American emergency management community will not
be fully prepared to protect, mitigate, and respond to the threats
facing the Nation.
There is no currently no scientifically-based method, of which I am
aware, to link any specific individual disaster to climate change. But
we can predict that a changing climate will make disasters worse--more
frequent and more intense storms, often in places unaccustomed to such
events; reduce the effectiveness, or render inoperable, infrastructure;
exacerbate flooding; and even public health emergencies from the
potential spread of mosquito and other insect-borne diseases into new
areas.
By objective, empirical measures, the Earth's climate is changing.
The past 5 years have been the hottest 5 years in human history; 8 out
of the top 10 have been in the past 10, and all of them in past 20. The
atmospheric gasses that have the greatest impact on heat retention have
increased to levels never before recorded or measured. Within the past
few weeks, the NOAA Mauna Loa observatory measurement of carbon dioxide
in atmosphere was 415 parts per million, a 30 percent increase since
the 1960's, half again as much as the start of the industrialist
revolution, and on its way to twice the concentration that has existed
over the past 10,000 years. Water vapor, the variable with the most
impact on warming, has also been increasing. As warmer air holds more
water, a feedback loop develops which may result in further warming.
Further, a warmer atmosphere holding more moisture can result in
significantly heavier rainfall in shorter periods of time. According to
the fourth annual National Climate Assessment, the number of the top-
heavy precipitation events United States, in the Midwest and Northeast
in particular, have increased by 40 percent to 50 percent since 1900,
and may increase as much as a further 50 percent over the next 50
years.
American society has grown as it has, in the places it has, with
the infrastructure is has, in an adaptation to the environment and
climate of its regions, and with a change to that climate, our
infrastructure is often unsuited to the volume of runoff, temperature,
water resources. Changing demographics and economics has resulted in
increasing urbanization and a migration toward coasts globally, and the
United States is no different. This puts a growing population, and its
housing stock and economic production, in the way of potential changing
weather patters, and likely increasing risk.
With this increase in heat retention in the atmosphere, comes
warmer oceans. Hurricanes, typhoons, and other cyclonic storms are
fueled by warm water, and with warmer water, comes the potential for
stronger, more intense coastal storms. And with warmer water further
north and comes new storm risks in areas unaccustomed to frequent
tropical storms. Shifting temperatures also result in shifting weather
patterns in the in interior, potentially resulting in greater or less
snowfall in areas, and changing spring flood risk.
Warmer water also occupies greater volume than cooler water, and so
in combination with melting polar ice, warmer oceans result in a rising
sea level, raising the base level on which storm surge and tsunamis
ride greatly increasing the potential inundation areas. Additionally,
non-storm high tide flooding, or so-called ``nuisance flooding'' or
``blue sky flooding'' is an increasing problem in American cities such
as Charleston, South Carolina and Annapolis, Maryland. The
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's most conservative estimates
for potential sea level rise, not even accounting for subsidence as
we're seeing in the Chesapeake Bay and Norfolk areas, we can expect up
to 2 feet of rise by the end of the century. Using updated data and
methods, the National Climate Assessment predicts up to 4 feet. For
context, here in Washington, that results in flooding of much of
Anacostia Naval Station and Reagan National Airport on a normal day. If
the storm surge experienced during Hurricane Isabel or Hurricane Hazel,
it could mean well into Washington, DC, and flood all of Bolling Naval
Air Station and Reagan National Airport, and all of Norfolk.
There is an old saying regarding the difference between weather and
climate that ``climate it what you expect, and weather is what you
get'' and that's no more obvious than with the effect of a warming
global climate on severe cold weather events in winter. Warmer air from
the tropics disturbing the winter jet stream results in unusually cold
arctic air being pulled down into the Midwest and mid-Atlantic,
spawning so many of the comments dismissive of climate-change warnings
such as ``if there's global warming, why is it so cold?'' These
unusually cold weather events degrade first responders' capabilities
and exhaust the resources of even otherwise well-prepared cities,
putting millions of people at risk.
Changing weather patterns affect wildfire risk as well. According
to analysis of the National Research Council, we have experienced an
extension of the western fire season of more that 2 months, and average
size of wildfires has increased by 300 percent.
And what does this mean for disaster impacts and FEMA and emergency
management? Using the recent past for an expectation of future
disasters has always been a challenging approach. The variability of
natural events intersecting with our communities means that estimating
the probability of disaster activity 1 year to the next is difficult.
As with hurricane season prediction, a less-than-average year can still
overwhelm the response and recovery system with a single storm coming
ashore in the wrong place as we experienced with Hurricane Andrew. In
the face of what we can objectively observe as a rapidly-changing
disaster environment, we must ensure we take this very likely different
future into account when planning.
While many attempts to address the impacts of climate change have
been made in recent years, the word ``climate'' does not occur once in
the current 2018-2022 FEMA Strategic Plan. One may make the argument
that the general philosophical approach to emergency management, that
of ``all-hazards'' preparedness in which agencies prepare for any
possible disaster rather that specific scenarios, and that a changing
climate does not create new hazards, but simple exacerbates existing,
and therefore attention to climate change is unnecessary. But that
belies the truth: Staffing, budgeting, the number and scale of response
teams, equipment, prepositioning, and even response planning
assumptions, are all based on an assessment of what worked or didn't in
previous disasters. And underestimating the severity, frequency, or
possible location of disasters will result in organizations under-
resourced for the missions at hand.
The strategic objectives of FEMA are laudable and will likely
assist in preparing for the effects of climate change. For example,
quadrupling the investment in mitigation is an ambitious and
potentially valuable effort. However if this investment is made against
a base flood elevation model that does not account for rising sea
levels and increased rainfall intensity, it can likely lead to poor
decisions and wasted money and effort. In 2015, President Obama issued
E.O. 13690 which among other things, directed climate-informed decision
making in relevant policy and established a Federal flood standard of
an additional 2 feet of free board for non-critical actions and 3 feet
for critical actions (such as the location of critical infrastructure).
In August 2017, President Trump rescinded it.
FEMA, the Federal Government, and the American emergency management
community, is not likely to be right-sized or positioned for its
potential disaster mission load, nor able to support smart investment
in disaster mitigation and risk reduction without accounting for a
likely future that is very different from its recent past. The
international community recognized this with the Sendai Framework for
Disaster Risk Reduction, to which the United States is a signatory, by
calling on nations to ``prepare or review and periodically update
disaster preparedness and contingency policies, plans, and programmes .
. . considering climate change scenarios and their impact on disaster
risk . . . ''. We should too.
Thank you again for the opportunity to discuss the impact of
climate change on disasters and the emergency management system in the
United States. I look forward to your questions.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Mr. Manning.
Ms. Kristie Trousdale is the deputy director for Children's
Environmental Health Network.
We would at this time hear your summary of your testimony.
STATEMENT OF KRISTIE TROUSDALE, M PH, DEPUTY DIRECTOR,
CHILDREN'S ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH NETWORK
Ms. Trousdale. Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairman Payne,
Ranking Member King, and distinguished Members of the
subcommittee. It is an honor to testify before you today.
Our children are our most valuable resources. They
represent the future of our Nation. Yet 1 in 4 students in the
United States has a chronic condition.
Many of the childhood diseases and developmental
disabilities that have been increasing over the past 40 years
are environmentally mediated. Children are more vulnerable than
adults to environmental hazards because of their unique
physiological and behavioral traits and because their bodies
are still developing. The youngest children are not aware of
environmental risks, and they lack the knowledge, resources,
and power to address them.
Climate change heightens these risks, especially for
children from communities of color and lower income. Droughts,
wildfires, and extreme heat events are increasing in frequency
and intensity; hurricanes and flooding are increasing in
severity; and patterns of infectious disease are changing.
Pediatricians in the United States report that they are
already seeing the serious effects of climate change on
children's health. We know that young children are among those
most at risk from physical injuries and death resulting from
wildfires and weather disasters. They are dependent on
caregivers and may lack the knowledge, mobility, and
communication skills to keep safe.
Disasters can also cut off access to medical care,
compounding the risks to injured children as well as to those
with pre-existing conditions.
Extreme weather disasters also affect children's mental
health. Children exposed to Hurricane Katrina were 5 times as
likely as pre-Katrina cohorts to have serious emotional issues
such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and
depression. For many of the most vulnerable children, these
issues persist and adversely affect the trajectory of their
lives.
Heat waves are projected to increase in frequency and
intensity. Research has associated low birth weights, premature
birth, and congenital heart defects with maternal exposure to
extreme heat. Young children are also more vulnerable to heat-
related illness, and student athletes are at the greatest risk
from exertional heat stroke.
Climate change is degrading our air quality. Approximately
10 percent of children aged 5 to 19 in the United States suffer
from asthma. Increased levels of ground-level ozone,
particulate matter, and pollen due to warmer temperatures,
increased atmospheric carbon dioxide, and more frequent,
intense, and long-lasting wildfires exacerbate asthma symptoms.
Inhalation of particulate matter also affects unborn children
by increasing the risk for premature births and lower birth
weights.
Infectious disease risks, such as foodborne and waterborne
illnesses, increase with climate change. Access to safe
drinking water is critical. Children drink more proportionately
than adults, and because their immune systems are still
developing, they can have more pronounced responses to
infections.
In addition, the changing climate can create conditions
favorable for the spread of vector-borne diseases such as Lyme
disease and Zika. In the United States, young boys are among
those most at risk of contracting Lyme disease, and children
born to women infected with the Zika virus are at risk for
microcephaly, brain damage, and other birth defects.
Over 13 million children in the United States live in food-
insecure households, and disasters exacerbate this as families
face food spoilage, employment instability, and disrupted food
systems.
Also, many families rely on the free or reduced breakfasts
and lunches offered through schools to help ensure their
children are fed. When disasters strike, children, however, are
unable to attend school, some of them for weeks.
Indeed, schools and child care programs are important
settings for the approximately 65 million American children who
attend them and for their communities, yet there is no Federal
oversight for the protection of their environmental health in
these settings. Many facilities are old, contain hazardous
building materials, and are in poor condition. Many are located
on or near hazardous sites. These risks can be amplified in
disasters, and many schools and child care providers lack the
resources, capacity, and knowledge to address them.
Climate change makes children's environmental health and
issues of health disparities more visible than ever. I urge the
subcommittee to consider children's unique vulnerabilities in
all environmental decisions and policies within its
jurisdiction, providing special consideration of those children
who are most vulnerable. This is our moral imperative, and it
is an investment in the stability and security of our country.
Thank you for your leadership and for the opportunity to
testify before this subcommittee.

Prepared Statement of Kristie Trousdale
April 9, 2019
Good afternoon Chairman Payne, Ranking Member King, and
distinguished Members of the subcommittee. It is an honor to appear
before you today at this important hearing to discuss Homeland Security
impacts related to climate change. I am Kristie Trousdale, deputy
director of the Children's Environmental Health Network (CEHN).
CEHN is a National nonpartisan nonprofit organization with the
mission of protecting the developing child from environmental health
hazards and promoting a healthy environment. We raise awareness of how
natural and built environments affect children's health; support and
stimulate preventive research; advocate for strong, child protective
policy; and provide education and training to multiple audiences on
children's environmental health and actionable steps to reduce
children's exposures to environmental hazards. CEHN has been the
National leading voice of children's environmental health for over 27
years and leads or advises many of the critical National conversations
on children's environmental health issues, including service to the
National Institutes of Health and U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.
Our children are our most valuable resources. They represent the
future stability and security of our Nation. Yet approximately 75
percent of young Americans between 17 and 24 would not qualify for
military service, with nearly one-third ineligible due to health
problems other than obesity, such as asthma, mental health issues, or
Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.\1\ One in 4 students in the
United States students has a chronic condition, 1 in 5 has learning and
attention problems, and the number of children receiving Social
Security Income for disability is almost 7 times larger than it was 30
years ago.\2\ \3\ \4\

This is not just a problem for our country's military and defense
needs. Over the past 3 decades there has been an unsettling rise in the
number of Americans who are unfit for work. Currently over 13 million
Americans receive a disability check from the Government, and most of
them are unable to work.\5\ This represents a looming National security
and stability crisis. Many of the childhood chronic diseases and
developmental disabilities that have been increasing significantly over
the past 40 years are environmentally mediated, and many are already
increasing and intensifying due to our changing climate. Children from
communities of lower income and communities of color face greater
exposures to pollution and environmental hazards and suffer
disproportionately from the resulting health effects.\6\ \7\

Over 88 percent of global disease associated with climate change
impacts children--especially the youngest and most vulnerable
children.\8\ However, their unique needs continue to be under-
prioritized in conversations and actions around mitigation,
preparedness, response. I urge that the subcommittee use its role to
ensure that children's health and development are placed at the center
of decision making for policies within its jurisdiction related to
climate change.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is solid consensus in the scientific community that children
are more vulnerable than adults to environmental hazards because of
their unique physiological and behavioral traits. A child's patterns of
exposure differ than that of an adult. For example, many harmful air
pollutants are emitted or exist low to the ground, within a young
child's breathing zone, such as motor vehicle exhaust, mercury vapor,
radon, and pesticides.\9\ Infants and toddlers also crawl and play on
the ground and explore the world orally which exposes them, via
ingestion, to more hazards.\9\ Proportionately, children eat more,
drink more, and breathe more than adults, and their skin surface area
to volume ratio is greater as well, increasing risk for dermal
absorption of harmful compounds.\9\ Their bodies also differ in how
they absorb, detoxify, and excrete substances.
Additionally, children are more vulnerable to harm from these
exposures because their bodies are still developing. There are critical
windows of development for organs and organ systems, during which, if
disrupted by a harmful exposure or experience, adverse and lasting
effects can occur.\9\ Early exposures have the potential for not only
immediate harmful effects on children's health and development, but can
set up the system for developing disease later in life as well.\9\
Indeed, children have many years of life ahead of them within which to
develop symptoms of diseases with long latency periods that may have
been triggered by early exposures, such as cancer or Parkinson's
disease. Older children have agency, and more and more young people are
speaking out on their own behalf and mobilizing action with regard to
climate change's impacts on their generation. However, the youngest of
children are not aware of environmental risks and climate change, and
they lack the knowledge, mobility, funds, and power to address them.
Children are dependent on adults to protect them, and it is our moral
imperative to do so.

Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of
droughts, wildfires, and extreme heat events. It is increasing the
severity of superstorms and flooding and affecting the incidence and
geographic distribution of infectious diseases. These effects intensify
existing environmental health risks to children.\10\ In addition,
children are more likely to live in high-risk areas such as
floodplains, and they are more likely to live in poverty.\11\
Pediatricians in the United States report that they are already seeing
the serious effects of climate change on children's health.\12\ Thus,
mitigation of climate change via significant reductions in greenhouse
gas emissions is of utmost importance in child health protection.

In addition, children remain an afterthought in preparedness,
response, and recovery measures during natural disasters. In 2010, the
National Commission on Children and Disasters released an assessment of
the gaps in Federal planning that lead to risks to children in times of
disasters. The Commission developed 81 recommendations and sub-
recommendations to prioritize the health and safety of children in
preparedness, response, and recovery measures.\13\ However, as of 2015,
79 percent of these recommendations remained unfulfilled.\14\

The following climate change-related environmental effects are
among those of concern regarding children.
heat-related illness
Children and pregnant women are among those most at risk from
extreme heat events and the frequency and intensity of these events are
projected to increase in the coming decades due to climate change.
Studies have associated low birth weight, premature birth, and certain
congenital heart defects with maternal exposure to extreme heat during
critical windows of development.\15\ \16\ \17\ Young children are also
less able than adults to regulate their body temperature, they tend to
dehydrate more quickly, and they are more likely to be physically
active outdoors. Student athletes, especially youth football players
and long-distance runners, are at risk from exertional heat stroke.\18\
Over 9,000 U.S. high school athletes are treated for heat illness each
year, and in the past two decades, deaths of football players due to
heat stroke nearly doubled.\19\ \20\

air quality
Approximately 10 percent of children aged 5-19 in the United States
suffer from asthma.\21\ According to the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, 1 in 6 children with asthma ends up in the emergency
department and about 1 in 20 is hospitalized each year.\22\ Asthma is
the leading cause of school absenteeism, accounting for millions of
missed school days each year.\23\ The warmer temperatures brought about
by climate change lead to increased concentrations of smog/ground level
ozone, a major contributor to asthma exacerbation that is also known to
decrease lung functioning in young children and at elevated levels to
lead to the development of asthma in children who play outdoor
sports.\24\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Allergic response to pollen is also one of the most common causes
of asthma exacerbations in children, and warming temperatures extend
the length of pollen-producing plants' growing season and the duration
of the allergy season. In addition, increased levels of atmospheric
carbon dioxide results in increased production of pollen from plants
such as ragweed, and increased potency of the pollen produced.
Inhalation of particulate matter also exacerbates asthma and
children's other respiratory illnesses. This particle pollution can
also affect unborn children by increasing the risk for premature births
and for lower birth weights. Particulate matter is a mixture of solid
particles and liquid droplets found in the air. The particles exist in
many different sizes and can contain hundreds of different chemicals.
Those particles that are under 10 micrometers in diameter (PM10), and
especially those under 2.5 micrometers (PM2.5) in diameter, can lodge
deep within our lungs and pose the greatest health risks. Over 10,000
tons of PM2.5 were released during the burning of the northern
California wildfires in 2017.\25\ In the fall of 2018 California school
closures due to wildfires kept over 1 million children at home.\26\ The
frequency and intensity of wildfires is projected to increase in the
coming decades.

infectious diseases
Increasing temperatures and weather disasters cause increased food-
and water-borne illnesses, especially due to flooding, structural
damage, and power loss. For example, there were increased cases of
leptospirosis, a relatively rare bacterial infection in humans, in
Puerto Rico post Hurricane Maria, due to contaminated water.\27\
Because children's immune systems are still developing, they can have
more pronounced responses to infections.\28\ Severe disasters can also
hamper adequate health care service, amplifying the spread of
infectious diseases such as tuberculosis or influenza.

Altered patterns of rainfall can cause the expansion of breeding
grounds and range, and increased populations for mosquitos, ticks, and
other disease vectors for illnesses such as Lyme disease, dengue, and
Zika. Children tend to spend more time outdoors than adults, and in the
United States, young boys are among those most at risk from contracting
Lyme disease.\29\ Puerto Rico, which is hardest hit by the Zika virus
in the United States, has seen an increase in the Aedes mosquito
breeding grounds since Hurricane Maria, and research indicates that the
number of pregnant women with Zika is now near that of levels in 2016
during the height of the problem.\30\ Children born to women infected
with the virus are at risk of developing congenital Zika syndrome,
which includes symptoms such as microcephaly, brain damage, and other
birth defects.

injuries and death from extreme weather events
Young children are also among those most at risk from physical
injuries and death resulting from wildfires and severe storms. Settings
where children spend their time, such as school and child care
facilities, may be structurally unsound, or be otherwise unprepared for
disasters. Young children's mobility issues place them at higher risk,
as some need to be carried and others guided via handholding. Children
are among the most likely to drown in floods,\31\ and floodwaters can
pose electrical hazards, mix with and spread sewage and toxic
chemicals, hide unsafe conditions such as broken glass, and pose risks
of hypothermia. Compounding these risks is the fact that access to
medical care is jeopardized in extreme weather events, due to power
loss or facility damage. Children who are injured, or those with
chronic health conditions or special needs may not be able to receive
critical medical attention.

food security
As of 2016, over 13 million children in the United States face
hunger. Disasters exacerbate food insecurity for the poor, as
exemplified in under-resourced communities in South Florida after
Hurricane Irma. Families faced food spoilage and unpaid time off, and
most grocery stores only accepted cash and could not process
Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program debit-like cards due to power
outages.\32\ In Puerto Rico, 19.7 percent of families had difficulties
securing meals for their children daily after Hurricane Maria.\33\

Many families rely on the free or reduced breakfasts and lunches
offered through schools to help ensure their children are fed. However,
approximately 8.5 million children were unable to attend school, some
of them for weeks, due to Hurricanes Harvey and Irma.\34\ After
Hurricane Maria, students aged 5-17 in Puerto Rico missed an average of
78 days of school, and those children in preschool missed 92 days of
early learning and care in their programs.\33\

Extreme heat, drought, floods, and rising sea levels threaten
agricultural yield, fisheries, and meat production, as well, thus
affecting food prices and access for children and pregnant women in
poverty across the globe.\35\ In addition to a diminishing supply of
food, the quality of food is also at risk. Rising atmospheric carbon
dioxide, while producing bigger crops, reduces the nutritional value of
food crops. Staple crops, including rice, legumes, and wheat show a
loss of protein and micronutrients, including essential elements such
as iron and zinc, which are critical to children's health.\36\ Children
already at risk for malnutrition will face increased food insecurity
and resultant health and development problems.

access to safe drinking water
Flooding, structural damage, and power loss can lead to failed
drinking water systems and thus contaminated drinking water. Post-
Hurricane Harvey, 166 water systems were under boil-water orders and
another 50 water systems were shut down completely.\37\ One week after
Hurricane Maria 55 percent of Puerto Ricans lacked clean drinking
water,\38\ and 1 month after the disaster approximately 1 million were
without reliable drinking water.\39\ Heavy storms and flooding can also
contaminate private wells.

mental health
Children exposed to Hurricane Katrina were five times as likely as
pre-Katrina cohorts to have serious emotional issues, such as post-
traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and depression.\40\ According to
the Youth Development Institute of Puerto Rico, a reported 44 percent
of children struggled with emotional and behavioral problems after
Hurricane Maria, with 23 percent specifying struggles with anxiety.\33\
In addition to immediate fears of safety in a crisis situation,
children may experience a loss of home and belongings, may have to
leave their neighborhood, and may be separated from family, caretakers,
communities, and friends. Disasters may also destroy community
resources that are integral to their sound development, such as
schools, hospitals, and places of worship. Mental health implications
are concerning especially for those children who are already at higher
risk, such as those living in under-resourced areas.

important settings outside the home
Approximately 65 million children attend schools and child care in
the United States, yet many schools and child care programs in the
United States do not comprehensively evaluate nor address matters
pertaining to children's environmental health.\41\ \42\ There is no
Federal oversight for the protection of children's environmental health
in these learning and care settings, despite the legal mandate that
children spend a significant portion of their time in school
facilities. Many schools and child care facilities in this country are
old, in poor condition, and/or are located on or near hazards sites,
and already present environmental health risks which can be exacerbated
in disasters.\43\ \44\ In addition, many schools and child care
programs are unprepared to safely manage these crises.

The National Commission on Children and Disasters' 2010 Report to
the President and Congress outlined recommendations specific to both
settings, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has
developed a variety of tools as part of its Multi-hazard Emergency
Planning for Schools toolkit. Yet as of 2015 18 States and the District
of Columbia had not adopted minimum emergency planning standards at
schools and child care.\14\ While many schools and child care programs
have developed emergency plans, many plans do not meet National
guidelines and the implementation of plans are hampered due to funding,
training, capacity, and communications issues. In some States, school
and child care emergency plans are not mandated, and not all regulated
child care providers and/or schools are subject to the relevant
standards.
In addition, a great deal of focus centers around school or child
care evacuation planning and family reunification, and there is often
significant pressure to reopen schools as quickly as possible to
provide education and other key community services as well as stability
for children and their families after a disaster. Yet many health
problems from disasters arise during the recovery period. Mandatory
standards, protocols, and oversight for reopening schools and child
care facilities safely are needed to prevent unnecessary harmful
exposures to children, such as the serious mold and pest issues
reported at Brewster Middle School at Camp Lejeune when it reopened
after Hurricane Florence.\45\

conclusion and recommendations
Climate change makes children's environmental health issues more
visible than ever. It is a threat multiplier and it exacerbates
inequalities; children from communities of color and communities of
lower income bear the brunt of climate change effects.
I urge the subcommittee to understand and recognize that:
the environments where children live, learn, work, and play,
have direct and significant impacts on their health;
children, especially those from communities of color and
communities of lower income, including children on Tribal
lands, are particularly vulnerable to environmental hazards;
children are our future; and
we have a moral obligation to protect children.
I ask that the subcommittee:
consider children's health in all environmental decisions
and policies; and
provide special consideration and prioritization of those
children who are most vulnerable--those from communities of
color, from communities of lower income.
Apply the pediatric environmental health lens to climate
change legislation.
Support continued measures to aggressively mitigate the
changing climate.
Support measures to intentionally address children's
unique risks and needs in preparedness, response, and
recovery.
support all Federal, State, and Tribal agencies and programs
that protect children's health.
Ensure capacity, training, and funding needs--for improved
coordination across agencies, sectors, and multiple levels
of government in matters of preparedness, response, and
recovery measures.
Your support is critically needed for key Federal agencies such as
the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, especially the Office of
Children's Health Protection, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, especially the National Center for Environmental Health,
and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. These
agencies conduct research, set guidelines, and develop surveillance and
intervention programs to address children's environmental health
issues. They also help to fund critical efforts such as the Children's
Environmental Health and Disease Prevention Research Centers and the
Pediatric Environmental Health Specialty Units--programs which have
developed strong community ties.
I commend the subcommittee for holding this hearing today and for
inviting CEHN to provide the children's health perspective to the
conversation on climate change. Children, not profits, need to be
placed at the center of decision making to reduce the risk of disease
or disability, and to assure that our children will have long, healthy,
and productive lives. This is our shared moral imperative. Protecting
the health and development of our most precious resources will also
safeguard the stability and security of our country for generations to
come.
Thank you for the opportunity to testify on these critical issues
and thank you for your leadership.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Ms. Trousdale.
Let's see. Now we are going to recognize Chief Eggleston to
summarize his statement for 5 minutes.
STATEMENT OF DAN EGGLESTON, EFO, CFO, CMO, PRESIDENT AND
CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD, INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FIRE CHIEFS
Chief Eggleston. Good afternoon, Chairman Payne, Ranking
Member King, and distinguished Members of the subcommittee.
My name is Dan Eggleston, and I am the chief of Albemarle
County, Virginia, Department of Fire Rescue. I am also the
president and chairman of the board of the International
Association of Fire Chiefs, who I am representing today. Thank
you for the opportunity to testify at today's hearing.
No matter if it is a hurricane, tornado, flood, or wild
land fire, America's local fire departments are the first to
arrive on scene and often the last to leave. For the critical
first 24 hours, local fire departments must provide emergency
response in treacherous conditions without expectations of
immediate State or Federal assistance. In short, local fire
departments, large and small, are all-hazard responders,
responsible for meeting these great challenges.
The cost and intensity of climate-related disasters are
increasing. According to NOAA, the United States has witnessed
14 or more weather-related disasters costing more than $1
billion each year for the past 3 years. In addition, we have
seen the number of acres burned by wild land fires increase by
two-thirds over the past 10 years to 8.8 million acres.
In addition to property loss, these disasters are causing
tragic losses. According to NOAA, the 14 weather-related
disasters in 2018 costing more than $1 billion in damages
caused 247 deaths. According to NFPA, 44 firefighters were
fatally injured between 2007 and 2016 as a result of wild land
fires. An additional 1,335 ground injuries were caused by wild
land fires between 2011 and 2015.
Congress should take the following three steps to help
local communities and fire departments prepare for the
increased number of climate-related disasters.
No. 1, continue to promote mitigation efforts.
The IAFC thanks Congress for passing, and President Trump
for signing, the Disaster Recovery Reform Act. This legislation
promoted both pre-disaster and post-disaster mitigation
activities.
It also focused on the importance of State and local
adoption of model commercial and residential building codes.
The NIBS released a study earlier this year demonstrating that
the adoption of the model building codes generates a National
benefit of $11 for $1 invested.
Furthermore, the adoption of wild land fire codes provides
a benefit of $4 for every $1 invested. We urge Congress to
prioritize the use of Federal funds for building and rebuilding
structures in communities that meet this consensus-based code.
No. 2, support community preparedness programs.
The IAFC recommends that communities assess the risk of
floods, wind storms, and wild land fires. In order to prepare
for these disasters, the whole community must be engaged, from
Federal and State officials to local homeowners.
Programs like the IAFC's Ready, Set, Go! program help local
homeowners take steps to make their homes fire-safe, prepare
for the event of a wild land fire, and evacuate quickly when
fire threatens.
We have seen examples, including in the State of New
Jersey, where planning for wild land fires can be utilized to
help communities evacuate from other natural disasters. We ask
the Congress to continue to fund community preparedness
programs at FEMA and the U.S. Forest Service.
Finally, No. 3, support programs that prepare local fire
departments to respond to climate-related disasters.
A well-prepared fire department is best prepared to handle
a major disaster. Leadership programs at the U.S. Fire
Administration and National Fire Academy help fire service
leaders identify and prepare for all-hazard risk to their
communities. As disasters increase in intensity, they draw in
resources from around the Nation through EMAC and other mutual-
aid agreements.
It is important that local fire departments have the
necessary training, equipment, and staffing to respond to local
and regional and National disasters. The FIRE and SAFER grant
programs provide matching grants to local fire departments to
meet these needs. The U.S. Forest Service's State and volunteer
fire assistance programs provide links between Federal and
State authorities and local fire departments to prepare for
wild land fires. When disasters strike, the Nation's urban
search-and-rescue teams, hosted by local fire departments,
provide life-saving capabilities.
We ask that Congress reject proposed cuts to these programs
and adequately fund them. We also ask Congress to support
Nation-wide mutual-aid systems like EMAC and NMAS.
As the risk from climate-related events increases, the
Nation must take steps to mitigate, respond, and recover from
them. The Federal Government is working with partners like the
IAFC to prepare for these events. We ask that Congress continue
to support these efforts to keep Americans and our firefighters
safe.
Thank you again, and I look forward to answering any
questions that you may have.
[The prepared statement of Chief Eggleston follows:]
Prepared Statement of Dan Eggleston
April 9, 2019
Good morning, Chairman Payne, Ranking Member King, and
distinguished Members of the subcommittee. My name is Dan Eggleston,
and I am president and chairman of the board of the International
Association of Fire Chiefs (IAFC), and fire chief of the Albemarle
County, Virginia, department of fire rescue. Thank you for the
opportunity to participate in the committee's assessment of the
homeland security impacts of a changing climate.
The IAFC represents the leadership of over 1.1 million firefighters
and emergency responders. IAFC members are the world's leading experts
in firefighting, emergency medical services, terrorism response,
hazardous materials (hazmat) incidents, wildland fire suppression,
natural disasters, search and rescue, and public-safety policy. Since
1873, the IAFC has provided a forum for its members to exchange ideas,
develop best practices, participate in executive training, and discover
diverse products and services available to first responders.
the fire and emergency service community
America's fire and emergency services are the only organized group
of individuals that is locally situated, staffed, trained, and equipped
to respond to all types of emergencies. There are approximately 1.1
million men and women in the fire and emergency service--approximately
300,000 career firefighters and 800,000 volunteer firefighters--serving
in over 30,000 fire departments around the Nation. They are trained to
respond to all hazards ranging from earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes,
and floods to acts of terrorism, hazmat incidents, technical rescues,
fires, and medical emergencies.
The fire service protects America's critical infrastructure--the
electrical grid, interstate highways, railroads, pipelines, petroleum,
and chemical facilities--and is, in fact, even considered part of the
critical infrastructure. The fire service protects Federal buildings,
including military installations and interstate commerce. No passenger
airliner takes off from a runway or train leaves a station that is not
protected by a fire department.
the nation's changing climate
As the Nation's climate changes, it creates new challenges for the
Nation's fire and emergency service. No matter if it is a hurricane, a
tornado, flooding, or a wildland fire, America's local fire departments
are the first to arrive on scene and the last to leave. They must
provide emergency response and medical aid to the public despite the
outside conditions. In many ways, the Nation's changing climate is
helping to transform the local fire department into an all-hazards
response force.
It is important to recognize the effects of the Nation's changing
climate. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration, the United States averaged 6.2 weather-related disaster
events that each cost $1 billion or more each year from 1980 to
2018.\1\ In 2016, our Nation had 15 such events, 16 such events in
2017, and 14 such events in 2018.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
In addition, we have seen an increase in the Nation's wildland fire
problem. In 2018, the National Interagency Fire Center reported
approximately 58,000 fires, which burned approximately 8.8 million
acres. In comparison, there were almost 79,000 fires in 2008, which
burned approximately 5.3 million acres. So, even as the number of
wildland fires are reduced, their intensity increases.\2\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
There has been an increase in Federal spending on disasters. For
fiscal year 2018, Congress appropriated approximately $50 billion. In
contrast, Congress only appropriated approximately $18.5 billion for
fiscal year 2013, which includes the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy.\3\
These costs are equally clear in the wildland fire arena, where the
Federal Government spent a record $3.1 billion on wildland fire
suppression costs in 2018. From 2009 to 2013, the Federal Government
spent an average of $1.35 billion on wildland fire suppression costs.
By comparison, from 2014 to 2018, the Federal Government spent an
average of $2.34 billion on wildland fire suppression, an increase of
42 percent.\4\

These disasters have real-life costs too. The United States has had
241 weather and climate disasters since 1980 where overall damages
reached or exceeded $1 billion. The total cost of these 241 incidents
is more than $1.6 trillion. In 2018, the 14 weather or climate events
costing more than $1 billion in damages also caused 247 deaths.\5\
According to the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), a total
of 44 local firefighters were fatally injured between 2007 and 2016 as
a result of grass, brush, or forest fires or prescribed fires. Between
2011 and 2015, the NFPA reported that grass and forest fires caused an
average of 1,330 fireground injuries to local firefighters.\6\

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Nation needs to act and prevent the loss of life and property
in a dangerous and changing climate. The International Association of
Fire Chiefs recommends that the Nation take common-sense steps to
address this threat. We encourage Congress to continue to take steps to
mitigate the threats of climate-related disasters. We recommend that
Congress fund programs that help communities prepare for climate-
related events, like hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, and wildland fires.
We also ask that Congress support Federal programs and initiatives that
will help fire departments prepare for the growing number of climate-
related disasters.
the importance of mitigation
The IAFC thanks Congress for its recent focus on using mitigation
to drive down the cost of disasters. States and local communities
should take steps to mitigate the effects of major climate-related
disasters. These efforts can include acquiring and demolishing flood-
prone buildings; adding hurricane-safe shutters and tornado-safe rooms;
and replacing roofs and creating defensible space around buildings to
prevent wildland fires.
The IAFC recommends that States and localities adopt current model
building codes, including the International Building Code and the
International Residential Code. The National Institute of Building
Sciences released a study in January demonstrating that adoption of
model building codes generates a National benefit of $11 for every $1
invested. Furthermore, adoption of wildland fire codes provided a
benefit of $4 for every $1 invested.
The adoption of current building and fire codes has been proven to
prevent the tragic loss caused by climate-driven events. The Insurance
Institute for Business and Home Safety (IBHS) found that the adoption
of high-wind provisions in residential buildings reduced damage to
houses in Florida, After Hurricane Charley in 2004, the claim frequency
for houses built after 1996 (when Charlotte County, Florida, enacted
high-wind standards) was reduced by 60 percent and the claims were 42
percent less severe when a loss occurred.\7\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\7\ ``Hurricane Charley: Natural Force vs. Structural Strength,''
Institute for Business and Home Safety, 2012, p. 5.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
States and localities determine the adoption and application of
building codes and standards, which means that code adoption varies by
State and locality. Five States representing 12 percent of the Nation's
population have State building codes that are 9 or more years old.
Where States allow local governments to determine code adoption, 25
percent and 10 percent of residents in some Midwest and Gulf Coast
States, respectively, also live in communities with years-old building
codes. Of the 21 States that regularly face tornado risk, just 8
require tornado shelters for schools.
The IAFC thanks Congress for passing the Disaster Recovery Reform
Act (DRRA; Pub. L. 115-124). This law focuses on pre- and post-disaster
mitigation to reduce the cost of disasters. The bill creates a National
Public Infrastructure Pre-Disaster Mitigation fund to help States take
actions to prevent the threat of natural disasters. It also
incentivizes States to adopt model building codes by providing Public
Assistance funds to replace and restore damaged facilities to the
latest codes and standards. In addition, Pub. L. 115-124 allows States
that receive Fire Management Assistance Grants to receive post-fire
hazard mitigation assistance to help communities recover and prevent
deadly floods after wildland fires. We ask that Congress monitor the
implementation of the DRRA to ensure that the Federal Emergency
Management Agency meets its commitments.
community preparedness
Local communities can take steps to prepare themselves for the
threat of climate-related incidents. They can set and adopt current
codes to ensure that buildings can sustain hurricane-strength winds or
are built using fire-safe materials. Also, they can plan evacuation
routes and exercise their implementation in case of advanced-notice
events like hurricanes or short-notice events, like wildland fires.
Also, Federal and State authorities can work together to clear
hazardous fuels and plan for response to climate-driven risks like
strong winds, flooding, and wildland fires. Local homeowners also
should take steps like clearing brush around their homes to create a
defensible space for wildland fires; boarding up their homes before
hurricanes; and following State and local authorities' evacuation
orders.
The IAFC and local fire departments support community risk
reduction efforts. For example, we urge Federal, State, Tribal/
territorial and local governments to develop community wildfire
protection plans (CWPP). These plans identify and mitigate wildland-
fire risks within communities. They also guide hazardous-fuels
reduction programs on Federal lands and prioritize Federal funding for
associated projects.
With the assistance of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA)
Forest Service, the IAFC runs the ``Ready, Set, Go! (RSG)'' program to
help communities prepare and respond to the threat of wildland fires.
Using RSG resources, local fire departments assist residents in
developing mitigation plans (Ready) and teaching them to be
situationally aware (Set) and take action early and follow their
personal wildland-fire action plans should there be a need to evacuate
(Go). Currently, there are 1,881 RSG members in all 50 States.
This type of community preparedness supports an all-hazards
response. For example, the Barnegat Volunteer Fire Department near the
New Jersey Pine Barrens was a long-time RSG member. The fire department
spent more than 2,000 hours educating its communities about how to
create defensible space, maintain situational awareness and develop
evacuation plans in the case of wildland fires. When Hurricane Sandy
struck in 2012, the fire department worked with the police department
and used RSG planning to evacuate the community successfully.
The IAFC recommends that Congress continue to support Federal
programs that champion community preparedness planning. Community
preparedness is a key component to addressing risks caused by the
changing climate. By promoting collaboration at the local level,
communities can work with Federal, State, Tribal/territorial and
neighboring local agencies to educate local citizens about the risk of
hurricanes, tornadoes, flooding, and wildland fires. They also can help
the public to take actions to reduce these risks. Community-
preparedness programs also can help localities reduce the threat of
climate-driven disasters by collaborating to reduce hazardous fuels and
strengthen infrastructure, and help citizens take steps to strengthen
their homes. Finally, these programs are important in helping local
citizens to evacuate in a safe and timely manner.
ensuring an effective response
When a climate-driven disaster strikes, the local fire department
will be the first response unit on scene. For example, the NFPA reports
that local fire departments responded to an estimated average of
306,000 brush, grass, and forest fires in the United States per year
from 2011-2015.\8\ An effective emergency response is key to reducing
the damage from a disaster and ensuring an effective recovery.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\8\ Marty Ahrens, Brush, Grass, and Forest Fires, National Fire
Protection Association, September 2018, p. 7.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
At the local level, it is important to have experienced leadership.
The U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) hosts the National Fire Academy
(NFA), the Nation's premier fire and emergency services educational
institution. As the fire service's mission has transformed to all-
hazards response, the NFA has helped generations of fire service
leaders to manage that change. The NFA has trained more than 1.4
million students since 1975. It includes both in-person and electronic
courses to help fire service leaders adapt to the new missions that
they face. We thank Congress for its continued support for USFA and NFA
and are grateful for the Trump administration's proposed increase
funding for these programs. We ask that Congress fund USFA at $50
million for fiscal year 2020.
It is important that fire departments be able to provide mutual aid
to each other during major climate-driven disasters, both at the local
and the National levels. For example, 17 States, including North and
South Carolina, provided assistance to California in response to the
October 2017 wildland fires. Developments in GIS and technology offer
the opportunity to transform interstate and intrastate mutual aid and
provide effective assistance in a timelier manner.
In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, the IAFC helped States to
create State-wide mutual-aid agreements and plans to deploy fire
department staffing and equipment in response to major disasters and
everyday incidents. To help States manage their resources, the IAFC
developed Mutual Aid Net, which is still in use in 18 States today.
This system is an addition to the Emergency Management Assistance
Compact (EMAC).
As a further evolution, the IAFC has partnered with Juvare's WebEOC
and Esri's ArcGIS platforms to develop the National Mutual Aid System
(NMAS). NMAS will be a tool used to request, locate, and deploy
resources through all phases of a response. Using NMAS' GIS mapping
tools, fire departments will be able to visualize in real-time where
resources are, where they need to go, and determine response times for
decision making.
An adequately trained, staffed, and equipped local fire department
is a significant component to the response to a climate-driven event.
Local fire departments provide the initial response to the events. For
example, local fire departments--in many cases, volunteer fire
departments--provide nearly 80 percent of the initial attack on
wildland fires in the United States. In addition, local fire
departments play a key role in the National Preparedness System, where
Fire Management and Suppression has been identified as a core
capability of the National Preparedness Goal. When local communities
require interstate or intrastate aid, they rely upon local fire
departments across the Nation to provide aid through the EMAC, State
mutual-aid plans or local mutual-aid plans. If local fire departments
do not have adequate staffing and equipment, the National Preparedness
System breaks down.
However, there are serious challenges to the preparedness of the
Nation's fire and emergency service. For example:
Almost three-quarters (71 percent) of the fire departments
who perform wildland firefighting or who fight structure fires
in the wildland urban interface (WUI) have not formally trained
all their firefighters in this activity.
Two-thirds of the departments that fight these fires have
firefighters who do not have the appropriate personal
protective equipment for wildland firefighting.
Twenty-nine percent of fire departments have firefighters
who have not received specialized training on firefighting in
the WUI.\9\
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
\9\ Ibid.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Congress has taken steps to address these shortages. The Assistance
to Firefighters Grant (AFG; also known as the FIRE Act) grant program
and the Staffing for Adequate Emergency Response (SAFER) program
provide matching grants to help local fire departments meet their basic
needs and improve their capabilities to respond to all hazards. The AFG
program helps localities train and equip for climate-driven disasters,
like wildland fires, flooding, and windstorms. The SAFER program
supports staffing for career, volunteer, and combination fire
departments. The IAFC thanks Congress for its support for these
programs and asks that both programs be funded at the fiscal year 2011
level of $405 million for each program.
Specifically, for wildland fire programs, Congress created the
Volunteer Fire Assistance (VFA) program at the USDA's Forest Service.
This program provides Federal assistance to State foresters to help
rural fire departments respond to wildland fires on neighboring Federal
land. Communities with populations of less than 10,000 can receive
funding to use for training and equipment through the VFA program. The
IAFC thanks Congress for the recent increases in funding for the VFA
program and asks Congress to appropriate $18 million for the program in
fiscal year 2020.
As climate-driven disasters increase, the IAFC requests that
Congress continue to fund the Urban Search and Rescue (US&R) System.
The US&R teams are located across the Nation and possess critical
skills in responding to hurricanes, tornadoes, wildland fires, and
other climate-driven disasters. These specialized teams are
internationally recognized for the life-saving aid that they provide to
desperate communities. We urge Congress to fund $50 million for the
US&R system in fiscal year 2020 to help the teams maintain their
readiness in an advanced operational tempo. We also ask Congress to
pass H.R. 639, which would clarify that Federal employees, like Federal
firefighters, can participate in US&R teams.
In addition, it is important to point out that programs like the
State Homeland Security Grant Program (SHSGP) and the Urban Areas
Security Initiative (UASI) support all-hazards response, despite their
focus on terrorism preparedness. The programs use Federal funds as an
incentive for fire; emergency medical services; law enforcement; public
health; and other Federal, State, Tribal/territorial, and local
agencies to plan and exercise together. Whether an act of terrorism, a
wildland fire, or a hurricane, it is important for the key decision
makers to have planned, trained, and exercised together before an
event. Because of the beneficial role that these programs play in all-
hazards response, the IAFC asks Congress to reject the cuts proposed
for fiscal year 2020.
conclusion
I thank you for the opportunity today to testify about the effects
of climate change on homeland security. For the Nation's fire and
emergency service, the increase in climate-driven events has steered a
transformation to an all-hazards response force. As the threat of these
climate-driven events increases, the Nation must focus on taking steps
to mitigate this threat and prepare to respond to more serious
incidents over time.
Specifically, the IAFC urges Congress to take the following
actions:
(1) Support Mitigation Efforts.--Congress made a good first step by
passing the Disaster Recovery Reform Act (Pub. L. 115-124). Now
Congress must ensure that it is implemented correctly. Congress
also must support the State and local adoption of current model
building codes and provide incentives for their adoption. We
know that these building codes will save lives and property. As
Congress considers legislation to modernize the Nation's
infrastructure, we ask that Federal funds be used to make sure
that new infrastructure meets the relevant model building
codes. We also ask that Congress support pre- and post-hazard
mitigation initiatives like the new Pre-Hazard Mitigation fund
established by the DRRA.
(2) Support Community Preparedness Efforts.--Programs like the
Ready, Set, Go! program help local communities prepare for the
threat of wildland fires, floods, hurricanes and other climate-
driven disasters. Community risk reduction and community
preparedness efforts help communities prepare for all hazards
and educate the public about steps that they need to take to
prepare their homes.
(3) Support Federal Programs that Promote an Effective Emergency
Response.--When a disaster strikes, local fire departments will
be the first to arrive. The Federal Government realizes this
fact and supports programs like the AFG, SAFER, and VFA
programs to help train, equip, and staff fire departments.
Congress should support these programs and National assets like
the US&R system. We also ask that Congress continue to fund
training programs at the USFA and NFA.
As the risk from climate-related events increases, the Nation must
take steps to prepare ourselves to mitigate, respond, and recover from
them. The Federal Government has taken steps with partners like the
IAFC to prepare for these events. We recommend that Congress continue
to support these efforts to keep Americans safe.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Chief.
I want to thank you all the witnesses for their testimony.
I remind each Member that he or she will have 5 minutes to
question the panel.
I will now recognize myself for questions.
Dr. Caldas, what do you think is the most dangerous part of
this administration's anti-science agenda?
Ms. Caldas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I believe that there are several aspects of the anti-
science agenda that are not in the best interests of the
American people.
Sidelining expertise and independent scientific advice is
one of them. Reducing access, public access, to science,
Government science and Government-scientific reports. Also
compromising public protections.
That is because, by doing these things, they are preventing
scientists from bringing the information to the public. They
are preventing scientists from talking about their own science
to the media and communicating it in a relevant way for the
public and for policy makers.
They are compromising protections--air quality protections,
environmental protections, pollution protections--that are not
in the best interests of the American people.
They are also reducing--not reducing. They are also
stopping and compromising the public advisory--scientific
advisory committees. They are compromising or closing, shutting
then down altogether.
They are keeping scientific advisory positions not filled.
They are vacant.
Mr. Payne. Yes.
Ms. Caldas. So all of this is not bringing science into
policy making. All of these things together are not in the best
interests of the American people and of the environment.
Mr. Payne. Thank you. Yes, it appears that this
administration really enjoys having many positions--now we are
finding at DHS acting FEMA director, acting Secretary of
Homeland, acting--everyone is acting, you know? It really
causes a problem.
Mr. Manning, I am very worried about the Trump
administration's decision to roll back the rules that would
require all infrastructure projects receiving Federal dollars
to be built to flood-resistant standards. Can you discuss some
of the future risk now that the Federal Government has
abandoned this resilient building proposal?
Mr. Manning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Yes, I share your
concern with the eradication of those requirements.
The Executive Order--the previous requirements on
infrastructure investment was a 2-foot additional elevation
above base flood elevation. You may all be familiar with the
flood maps, flood zones. For critical activities, things like
critical infrastructure, firehouses, command centers, an
additional 3 feet.
What we have seen--those were based on the IPCC most
conservative guidelines of a 2-foot rise in sea level over the
next 50 years. I think most people--and I would defer,
actually, to my colleague to the right here, accept that that
is an overly conservative estimate, that it is probably going
to be closer to 4 or more feet over the next 50 to 100 years of
sea-level rise.
The base flood elevations as they are also don't account
for severe rainfall. So all of the mitigation investments that
we make, all of the public infrastructure investments we make
as a Nation could potentially be at risk if we are building in
low-lying elevations. We see repeatedly things like wastewater
systems that don't function because of rising sea level making
the drainage systems not work.
We make investments in critical infrastructure facilities
at places that will flood repeatedly. As it is today, we see in
Annapolis, Maryland, right outside the Naval Academy, it floods
frequently with no rainfall, just because of rising sea levels
in the Chesapeake.
A restoration of some restrictions, some additional
freeboard in order to receive and spend Federal dollars in
public infrastructure is an absolutely critical and wise
decision into the future for us.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, sir.
I will now let the Ranking Member have 5 minutes for
questions.
Mr. King. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Chief Eggleston, thank you for your testimony. Thanks for
being here today.
In your testimony, you discussed the importance of
community preparedness. Now, as far as I know, in New York, New
York City and the suburbs, they are pretty much on that, and
they are actively engaged.
But what can the Federal Government do to continue to work
with and encourage communities across the country to achieve a
culture of preparedness, especially a community that hasn't
been hit yet and they just think it is somebody else's problem?
Chief Eggleston. Thank you, Congressman, for the question.
I think we have a lot going on right now in terms of
partnerships, like with the IAFC and FEMA, programs in place.
Our point and our ask at this point is to continue to fund
those programs, encourage communities to reach out and engage.
Our communities are constantly changing, education requirements
are constantly evolving, so it is an ever-going process.
But at the local level, I can tell you that we need some
help in terms of funding to continue those programs into the
future. But education is the key to help build a resilient
community. Our process right now is unsustainable, in terms of
our response. We have to build a more resilient and prepared
community.
Mr. King. Along those levels in the funding, one area,
among others, that the Chairman and I would agree on is on the
FIRE grants, SAFER grants. In fact, I guess beginning in the
last year of the Obama administration, unfortunately all 3
years of the Trump administration, their budget has called for
really radical, severe cuts in those grants. The past three
times, Congress has overcome that. Hopefully we will do it
again. I think there is bipartisan support for those grants.
But apart from the actual political benefit or the popular
benefit of those grants, can you give some detail as to how the
money is spent, why it is important, why it is not just another
level of spending?
Chief Eggleston. Certainly.
Mr. King. I am on your side on this. I am giving you the
opening there.
Chief Eggleston. I can speak from my local department, in
that we were a recipient of both a SAFER and an AFG grant.
A SAFER grant allowed us to hire early 9 firefighters to
kick-start a new station for our community that helped us lower
our ISO rating, which provided benefits in terms of insurance
savings to our citizens. But it also provided a much-needed
protection to a very vulnerable population.
We also were able to take advantage of an AFG grant to
target a vulnerable population, those who live below the level
of poverty in the southern part of our county, to go in and
educate the community and install smoke detectors and have a
conversation about how to reduce risk.
So those are two real good examples of recent activities
just in Albemarle County of how we benefited from those very
valuable grants. I appreciate your support on those.
Mr. King. Thank you.
Not in a political sense but in a very effective
Governmental lobbying sense, does the International Association
of Fire Chiefs intend to take a stand on this and be
aggressive, you know, contacting local Members of Congress,
contacting the administration on this?
Chief Eggleston. We do. We constantly encourage our members
to reach out and engage with their elected officials to support
the AFG and SAFER grants and all mitigation grants. We are
actively involved in promoting any kind of mitigation
activities to help us address this problem on the all-hazard
problem, quite frankly.
Mr. King. Well, thank you for your service. Thank you for
cementing the relationship between me and the Chairman here
today, sir.
Thank you very much. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, Ranking Member.
Next, we will hear from the gentlelady from New York, Ms.
Clarke.
Ms. Clarke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank our Ranking
Member. I want to thank our expert panelists for their
testimony here today.
The House has a responsibility to speak out and take action
on climate change. Its impact to homeland security, I think,
can't be minimized. FEMA has a very huge, mammoth task ahead of
itself. Particularly when we are talking about emergency
preparedness, we know that there are going to be multiple
events. We have some still going on right now in the United
States of America.
I think it is critical that we look at this from a
migration standpoint. There will be a point where people are
unable to live in their communities if we don't begin
mitigating the effects of climate change and will have to move
to other parts of the country in order just to survive.
So I want to politely disagree with my colleague Mr. King,
who kind-of indicated that there is another area of
jurisdiction that should be looking at this issue. I think we
need an all-hands-on-deck, quite frankly, approach to what we
know is already an issue for the American people.
When we hear the President say climate change is fake news,
one wonders whether he also believes that the Earth is still
flat--or that the Earth is flat. Because denying the reality
that greenhouse gas emissions are contributing to rising seas
and extreme temperatures flies in the face of what we are
experiencing, of the science. Within the scientific community,
the debate has already been settled.
So today's hearing is about recognizing that climate change
is not only an environmental threat, but it is a threat to
homeland security, and it is an existential threat to human
life.
Rising seas, flooding neighborhoods, they are also
threatening critical infrastructure. So when farmers' fields
run dry from prolonged drought, it creates a humanitarian
crisis of hunger and despair, the seeds from which terrorism
can emerge. We have seen this in other parts of the world. So
we are not stretching here to have this hearing today.
Last week, as vice chair of the Energy and Commerce
Committee, I was proud to mark up a bill, and I am an original
cosponsor of the Climate Action Now Act, which seeks to reverse
the illogical withdraw from the Paris Agreement. The
environmental causes of climate change are reason enough to be
bold and take international action. The homeland security
implications that we are discussing today only further
reinforce the need to reduce carbon emissions and embrace green
technologies before it is too late.
My question, Mr. Manning, is on FEMA's capacity. We have
seen some of the worst disasters in the previous few years, and
FEMA, frankly, has seemed stretched too thin to adequately
respond in all cases.
Can you discuss some of the impacts to the agency and its
work force if we don't get serious about incorporating efforts
to mitigate climate change into our Federal policy?
Mr. Manning. Thank you, Congresswoman. That is a wonderful
and very on-point question.
FEMA, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, does all of
its budgeting, planning, and staffing based on an analysis of
what they expect basically the next fiscal year's worth of
disasters to look like. The planning goes, obviously, much
longer than a fiscal year, but from a budgeting perspective,
how many people work at FEMA, what does the staffing look like
is all based on the fiscal years and a look backward at
disasters.
Not unlike the way Department of Defense has a two-theater
approach to its strategic mission load, FEMA does the same with
two type 1 disasters happening in two parts of the country at
the same time. Those are defined roughly as the things that
they experienced in the past.
The concerns with not explicitly and overtly addressing the
changes from a changing climate on the face of those disasters
are that we will see--I mean, in combination with a migration
of people to coasts and urbanization, we will see much larger
disasters. We are already seeing much more intense hurricanes,
much more heavy rainfall, and much more widespread flooding.
If the disasters that we see, our run-of-the-mill--``run-
of-the-mill'' disasters are that much worse and our
catastrophic disasters are that much worse, FEMA won't be
positioned correctly with budgeting and resourcing and manpower
to be able to deal with that.
The planning assumptions on how the Federal Government
organizes to support States will also be insufficient, because
it will be based on two not-severe-enough of storms and
disasters into the future.
Ms. Clarke. I know. Can you say ``Puerto Rico''?
With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
Next, we will hear from the gentleman from Texas, Mr.
Green.
Mr. Green. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
I thank the witnesses for appearing as well.
Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for first responders,
firefighters, peace officers, people who rush in when others
are rushing out. Because I have such respect for them, I am
curious about the esprit de corps, the morale, when we have
fires in the West and they are consuming not only property but
in many cases people, and the firefighters are there risking
their lives, and we have a Commander-in-Chief who seems to say
things that are antithetical to what they are doing. How does
this impact the morale, the esprit de corps?
Chief Eggleston. Thank you, Congressman, for the question.
You know, firefighters are very task-oriented and mission-
focused. So, while I can't speak for the firefighters who were
on the front line, I think that they were focused on protecting
their communities. Because they have a love for the job and a
love for their service and a love for their fellow citizens,
and I think that is what motivates our firefighters.
Of course, I am sitting here thinking that we always need
to continue to support our first responders, firefighters,
police officers, and EMS workers, at all cost, because they are
the ones that have to deal with all kinds of everyday
disasters, including the large fires that we have seen out in
California.
So I say we do that through recognition and support through
Federal, State, and local funding is probably our best bet.
Thank you.
Mr. Green. Well, thank you.
Let's talk about chemical plants. In Houston, Texas, we
have a large concentration of chemical facilities. We recently
had an event, and there was a requirement that persons shelter
in place--shelter in place. Benzene was one of the chemicals
that persons were exposed to.
We have, as I understand it, a requirement that if a Coast
Guard person is exposed to benzene in an amount considered
dangerous, because it is a carcinogen, that we have to monitor
that person for the rest of his life to check to make sure he
is OK or she is OK.
I don't know that we have similar regulations,
requirements, rules for firefighters who are equally exposed.
Do you have any intelligence that you can share with me on this
question?
Chief Eggleston. Yes, sir. I am involved heavily in the
fire service in terms of cancer research. The IAFC supports the
adoption of an annual physical for all firefighters, which
includes screening for such cancers.
Firefighters are almost twice as likely to get cancer than
the average citizen. So we are very much focused on cancer
prevention and screening and do support an annual physical so
that we can keep firefighters' health safe and on the job.
In terms of working with industry, we promote fire
departments reaching out and engaging with local industry
through their LEPCs to plan for, in the event of an issue at
these localities, these plants, to plan long before the event,
to make those arrangements and those relationships ahead of
time and understand what the hazards to the citizens are. I
just spoke last week about a similar subject.
So I think it is really important to preplan those and
engage with the local industry and have a unified approach to
any emergency.
Thank you.
Mr. Green. Thank you.
My final question may be a little bit off-subject, in the
sense that this should relate more to first responders, in my
opinion, and persons who are helping us, but there was a
mention of children and how they are impacted by this.
When you hear the call ``shelter in place'' and your child
is away from you at school, can you give me some sense of what
the school of this future should look like such that children
will be able to properly shelter in place?
Anyone.
Chief Eggleston. I think it is important to focus on any
future building codes that may build a more resilient school
system. School systems and buildings that are built today have
a wide range of hazards that we have to deal with, including
things such as a threat from active shooters and environmental
threats and man-made threats.
So I would encourage us to continue to engage with our
local code officials and work with them to build more resilient
schools and think of an option like that--what would we need to
do to build a more resilient building to better prepare and
protect our children in the event of a shelter-in-place
activity?
Mr. Green. Mr. Chairman, you have been generous with the
time. Thank you. I yield back.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, sir.
Next, we will hear from the gentleman from Texas as well,
Mr. Crenshaw.
Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Thank everyone for being here today.
One of the reasons I sought to join this committee was
because of my district. It is in Houston. My district was
devastated by Hurricane Harvey. Homes, businesses, lives were
lost, of course. The severity of the storm has been mentioned
in multiple opening statements, and I appreciate the focus on
it.
Although, we may disagree on this figure of 38 percent,
that it is 38 percent worse because of climate change. That
number is based on a computer model, not the scientific method.
But it doesn't really matter. What we do agree on is that it
was disastrous.
Harvey wasn't the first major flood we have had in Houston
either, because another thing we can agree on is that we have
been experiencing these for literally hundreds of years.
Between our founding in 1836 and 1936, Houston experienced 16
major floods, some of these cresting to more than 40 feet above
the bayou.
I have a printout here, actually. It is by the Harris
County Flood Control District. It is 11 pages' worth, since
1836, 11 pages' worth of major flooding. It is Houston, after
all. We are built on a bayou. We have clay for ground. Water
doesn't flow out of it very easily. It is flat ground. So we
understand how important this is more so than a lot of cities.
In 1900, a deadly hurricane wiped out what was then the
major regional city, Galveston. It was the deadliest storm in
U.S. history. It killed more than 6,000 people, caused $35
million in damage in 1900, equaling over a billion today. It
was actually because of that hurricane that people began moving
inland to what is now Houston. That is why Houston went from
44,000 people in 1900 to almost 2 million a century later and
well over 2 million today. Flooding has been a real problem in
Houston ever since its founding.
I didn't join this committee to discuss climate change. As
was pointed out earlier, that is not even in this committee's
jurisdiction. I find it to be a distraction. Because is it a
problem? Yes. Is it happening? I am not going to debate that.
But we are here to discuss disaster mitigation and how we can
mitigate flooding in any community and communities around the
country. That is what is important. That is what we can
address; that is what we can control. That is what we should be
addressing here today.
With that, I will start with Chief Eggleston.
Thank you for being here. Thank you for your testimony.
You mentioned the benefits of the Disaster Recovery Reform
Act and the importance of the new pre- and post-disaster
mitigation grants. The DRRA created a National Public
Infrastructure Pre-Disaster Mitigation Fund to help States take
actions to prevent the threat of natural disasters.
Just real quick, what are you most focused on in terms of
implementation to ensure that FEMA can properly identify worthy
investments?
Chief Eggleston. Well, thank you, sir, for the question.
I think that our focus should be on looking at the most
vulnerable populations and also enforcing the building codes to
build more resilient communities, is my feeling of where the
focus should be.
There is a wide range of communities out there that need
this kind of assistance, so where to start with that, I
couldn't tell you. But that would be my focus.
Mr. Crenshaw. OK.
The next question I want to ask is about the States'
ability to administer these in a flexible way. The DRRA
provides flexibility for States to administer their own post-
disaster housing strategies. Are there any other areas where
more flexibility would be warranted? Essentially what I am
asking is, where does Federal Government get in your way too
much, or is it just about right?
Chief Eggleston. Well, I have been involved in a couple of
recoveries from Nationally-declared disasters, and I think the
support that we have gotten from the State and from the Federal
Government was just right. I was a chief of a small community
that was devastated by a flood, and I thought the integrated
response system that was set up back in the 1990's worked
perfectly to help us recover and get back in shape rather
quickly.
So I am not sure exactly how to respond to that at this
point, because I haven't had recent activity of a Nationally-
declared disaster. But I would say that we need to focus on the
integration between the locality, the State, and the Federal
Government to make sure that that transition is smooth and as
less bureaucratic as possible.
Mr. Crenshaw. Mr. Manning, would you have anything to add
to those questions at all in my remaining time?
Mr. Manning. Congressman, simply that, from my time as both
a State official working for a Governor and the deputy
administrator at FEMA, I know the partnership, the balance
between Federal Government's support of State and local
governments is something that has always been--there has always
been an effort to right-size, to get that to work well.
I think my experience now, in the couple years outside
FEMA, the observation I have made is there seems to be strong
partnerships between the current leadership of FEMA and the
State and local government leadership. I think that has been my
observation of recent months.
Mr. Crenshaw. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
Mr. Payne. Thank you, sir.
I think there--apparently there is a common thread from our
colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Climate change is
causing a lot of these disasters to be magnified. This
committee deals with man-made and natural disasters. So I don't
think it is--I beg to differ with my colleagues. I don't think
it is out of line that we are discussing this today.
Let's see. Is that everyone?
Oh, Ms. Underwood. I am sorry. The gentlelady from Illinois
is recognized for 5 minutes.
Ms. Underwood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
This topic is critically important to us in the Illinois
14th District. My community in northern Illinois is facing
increasing threats dues to flooding along the Fox River in
McHenry County.
We must be prepared to respond to the serious safety and
economic risks that this flooding poses to the many homes and
businesses located along the river. Persistent flooding can
delay planting and damage crops, hurting our agriculture
industry. Our existing water infrastructure is degrading even
faster under these more extreme conditions.
Flooding has National security implications as well. Some
of our major Air Force and naval bases already experience
frequent floods. Three National Guard armories are located in
McHenry County alone.
So this issue isn't going away. In fact, researchers
suggest that this kind of extreme flooding will be the new
normal in our community because of climate change. Some of your
testimony did touch on flooding, and I would like to thank you
for including that level of detail.
My first question is for Dr. Caldas.
You are a climate scientist, and from your professional
perspective, can you tell us more about the specific threats
that climate change poses to communities like mine in the
Midwest?
Ms. Caldas. Thank you, Congresswoman.
The main aspect of the impacts inland is the extreme
precipitation events that are increasing not only frequency but
in intensity. The amount of rain falling in the 1-percent
heaviest events has increased quite a bit in the Midwest,
second only to the Northeast of the country.
So when you look at the main impacts that are already
correlated with climate change, the extreme precipitation
events is one that we can talk about. Because flooding is the
main consequence of extreme precipitation events, as you
mentioned, there will be quite a bit more flooding in the area
of your State.
However, we must not focus only on the physical impacts,
right? This is a committee on preparedness and response. So
when we talk about these disasters, we have to talk about
people. People are going to be exposed not only to the physical
impacts of these extreme events--the rain itself, the flooding
itself--but also the psychological impacts, the social impacts,
and everything that comes with a flood. Their house may not be
flooded, but their place of work may. The school of their
children may. They may lose their wages because they cannot go
to work.
They have psychological impacts because they get flooded
over and over again. I can yield to Mr. Manning here to talk
about repetitive losses if places get inundated over and over
and over again. Not only the mental impact is very big but also
the impact on the preparedness.
So I would say that extreme precipitation events and
flooding are No. 1.
Ms. Underwood. Yep. We are seeing that even in our
neighboring State of Iowa. So much of that State has had
catastrophic floods over the last month or so. It could happen
anywhere. It is happening more frequently.
Ms. Caldas. If I may, this last flooding event, it was not
even an extreme precipitation event. It was more of a perfect
storm, because there was record-breaking snowfall, which was
because there is a lot more water vapor in the atmosphere. That
is extreme precipitation in the form of snow, not rain.
So all that snow was there, and then the rain came down and
the snow was melted. With the frozen ground, there was nowhere
for the water to go but to the river, and all blocked up.
Ms. Underwood. Yep. So what can we expect to see in the
Great Lakes region in the next 5 or 10 or 20 years? What do you
think?
Dr. Caldas.
Ms. Caldas. Oh, you asking him?
Ms. Underwood. No, no. You.
Ms. Caldas. I, unfortunately, don't have a lot of specific
detail on----
Ms. Underwood. OK.
Ms. Caldas [continuing]. The Great Lakes. It is a very
important region, of course--fresh water and everything. I have
heard several people saying that it is going to be one of the
regions that is going to be the focus of a lot of migration.
Ms. Underwood. Thank you.
Flood waters, of course, don't just go away right after a
flood. Communities can remain under water for days or weeks,
like we just discussed.
So, Ms. Trousdale, can you discuss the public health
consequences of standing water after a flood? How are kids
potentially vulnerable to these consequences?
Ms. Trousdale. Thank you for the question.
Flood waters obviously pose a severe drowning risk for
children. They are among the most likely to drown in a flood.
It also can pose electrical hazards when there are downed power
lines. It can mix with raw sewage and toxic chemicals and then
leave behind residues that can contaminate children's
belongings, and children with open wounds can come into contact
and also be infected.
Then the retreat of flood waters obviously leaves behind
mosquito-breeding habitats, which can spread the vector-borne
diseases such as Zika and Dengue. Of course, children, because
their immune systems are still developing, they are potentially
at greater risk for harm from these infectious illnesses.
Ms. Underwood. Thank you.
You wrote in your testimony that children remain an
afterthought in preparedness, response, and recovery measures
during these natural disasters. I know that our committee is
committed to making sure that they are no longer an
afterthought moving forward.
Thank you so much for all of your work and for appearing
here today.
Mr. Chairman, I yield back.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
We probably have a little time to ask another round, if you
have time.
But let me say that, you know, the issue around climate
change and whether this is the proper jurisdiction, I was going
to get into that a little deeper, but I will accept that
everyone is entitled to their opinion.
Mr. Manning, can you explain to this committee why fighting
climate change matters in our efforts to stop terrorism?
Mr. Manning. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman.
You know, similar to the conversations we have been having
about the domestic impacts of changing growing patterns, of
weather patterns, flooding, that is an impact that is happening
globally. We have seen--currently, there are conflicts in North
and East Africa that are largely climate-driven, where there
are conflicts between pastoral herders and agrarian farmers
for--resource conflicts. I think there is a potential future
where there are growing resource conflicts--access to clean
drinking water, access to grazing lands, growing lands.
As you increase conflict, you have instability in nations,
you have radicalization, you have all of the ingredients
necessary that we have seen historically that lead toward
radicalization and terrorism.
There is some argument that the Syrian conflict has roots
in resource conflicts, climate-driven resource conflicts. It is
no secret to anybody, the impacts on our National security from
the growth of IS in the Syrian region.
So there is most definitely a link, a concern, going
forward, with the changing climate, what effect that changing
climate has on societies world-wide and the potential conflicts
that can be driven by access to resources as a result of those
changes.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
Ms. Trousdale, a lot of my work has been around vulnerable
populations since becoming a Member of this subcommittee,
Ranking Member, and now Chairman. So that is something--
children in vulnerable populations has been one of my main
focuses.
As a matter of fact, I was fortunate enough to pass the
CLASS Act of 2019 last week, which deals with active shooters.
We know what that devastation has been to our young people
across the country, as well as other populations.
Can you discuss any inequities in disaster recovery in
children? Are we seeing worse outcomes in poor, minority
children after a disaster?
Ms. Trousdale. Thank you for the question, Chairman Payne.
Unfortunately, disaster aid tends to favor wealthy
Americans and white Americans and homeowners. Because they have
relatively good jobs and higher incomes, they are able to have
some flexibility when they are in the recovery period searching
for new places to live. They are able to better navigate the
bureaucracy in order to access aid. They usually have a
stronger social network, so they are able to have help finding
new jobs and places to stay.
Because of this, they tend to do better than families with
lower incomes and from communities of color. This exacerbates
the existing economic and social inequities that exist. This,
obviously, then persists with the inequalities we see and the
health disparities that we are seeing among children as well.
It is just an unfortunate circumstance, and we need to
really address the issues that what may appear on surface as
equitable treatment in the cases of disaster aid doesn't
necessarily result in equitable benefits. This just means that
our children from more vulnerable and under-resourced
communities end up in worse positions than they started, and it
exacerbates their health.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
You know, I stay committed to raising these issues on a
National level in order that there is some equity for all
Americans in disaster times. We see what Katrina did. We saw
what Harvey did. You know, people of lesser means suffered
magnificently, incredibly. So I will continue to raise those
issues.
I will recognize the gentlelady from Illinois once again.
Ms. Underwood. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a quick
comment on the scope, climate change, and its role in this
committee.
You know, FEMA did include climate change in its strategic
plan over a number of years as a considerable threat to our
country and our on-going National security, including while Mr.
Manning was at the agency, included climate change, which was
important to allow the agency to plan forward.
So this subcommittee, which does deal with emergency
preparedness, response, and recovery, must recognize the
totality of the threats facing our Nation in order for those
most vulnerable Americans to have a chance at survival during a
disaster.
It is critically important, sir, and I would like to thank
you for holding this hearing today.
I am a nurse. I don't know if you all knew that. As health
providers, we are trained in a number of areas. During my
training, there wasn't necessarily a specific focus on disaster
medicine, and I know that that is the case for a variety of
health professionals. But we do know that the care that folks
receive after an emergency or after a disaster is critically
important. So I want to speak a little bit about these training
needs.
Ms. Trousdale, do you know or can you speak about the level
of training that providers receive in order to identify and
treat post-disaster medical issues, both for children and those
around them? Then do we need to provide more professional
training for medical response after a disaster?
If you could just provide some comments there.
Ms. Trousdale. Thank you for the question.
I can't speak to the level of training that health care
professionals currently receive regarding disaster response. I
can speak to the fact that we need climate change and
environmental health curricula in medical schools and nursing
schools, and it is an important component of schools of public
health as well.
All in the medical field need to understand the underlying
issues of pediatric environmental health and how children have
unique vulnerabilities so that they can better anticipate their
needs in a disaster, plan for them, and then be able to
respond.
It is not just the immediate responses that are necessary,
whether it is the physical trauma or the emotional health
issues, but it is following them up afterwards and making sure
that these children aren't--say, a child with asthma isn't
returning home to a home that is filled with mold or that has a
leaky roof and that children aren't returning to schools that
have toxic residues left over from a flooding clean-up that
wasn't done correctly.
So it is really important that all medical and nursing
professionals have a basic understanding of how children are
not just like adults but uniquely vulnerable.
Ms. Underwood. Thank you.
Did anyone else on the panel want to comment on that,
health professional training?
Mr. Manning. Well, Congresswoman, I would just like to jump
in to suggest that we always could use more training, in my
experience.
One of the roles I played at FEMA was overseeing the
Nation's training and education for the whole Homeland Security
mission, the emergency management part of that. The Department
trained millions of first responders a year. While I am very
proud of that, it is never enough. There is always more that
can be done.
We will become a stronger Nation and a stronger community
with stronger first responders but also general practitioners
and neighbors that know more about how to help each other in
emergencies. So I would fully support that.
Ms. Underwood. Thank you.
With that, I will yield back. Thank you, sir.
Mr. Payne. Thank you.
I would like to thank the witnesses for their testimony
today. It has been invaluable. We would like to thank all of
you for your valuable testimony and the Members for their
questions.
Members of the subcommittee may have additional questions
for the witnesses, and we ask that you respond expeditiously in
writing to those questions.
Pursuant to committee rule VII(D), the hearing record will
be held open for 10 days, without objection.
Hearing no further business, the subcommittee stands
adjourned.
[Whereupon, at 4:16 p.m., the subcommittee was adjourned.]
A P P E N D I X
----------
Question From Chairman Donald M. Payne, Jr. for Astrid Caldas
Question. What would you say to the people that still have doubts
about the current science pointing to the fact that human activity is
contributing to climate change?
Answer. I would say that real, observational data tells us that
there are unprecedented amounts of carbon dioxide (CO2) and
other heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere, that CO2 levels
have never been this high, and that the amount and speed of warming
currently observed has not been seen in the history of human
civilization. And I would tell them that yes, scientists can tell with
certainty (from both physics and chemistry) that human activity is
contributing to it.
The physics of global warming has been known for over a century,
and the relationship between CO2 and warming is well
understood. The more CO2 there is in the atmosphere, the
warmer it gets.
Scientists know that the massive increase in carbon dioxide is
almost entirely due to human activity by calculating how much
CO2 comes from burning fossil fuels and how much comes from
natural sources. That is because carbon from fossil fuels has a
different isotopic ``signature'' than carbon from other sources.
Because of that difference, we can say that carbon coming from fossil
fuel emissions is the largest contributor of CO2
concentrations since pre-industrial era. [An isotope is each of 2 or
more forms of the same element that differ in relative atomic mass but
not in chemical properties]
Added context for understanding the problem:
There is a well-known concept in psychology called confirmation
bias, which is our tendency to only listen to information that confirms
our existing beliefs or ideas. When people would like a certain idea/
concept to be true, they end up believing it to be true and seek
information that validates it. This cognitive bias is most pronounced
in the case of ingrained, ideological, or emotionally-charged views.
This is in part what has happened with climate change. So, telling
people more about the science is usually a moot exercise--even if it is
the truth. Mainly, we need people to see for themselves how things have
changed through the years and make the right connections. That is not
an easy thing to achieve.
I will however, highlight that confirmation bias is not a core
value such as faith, honesty, or ethics. People live by core values,
and those are usually unchangeable. Acceptance of climate change is NOT
a core value, and therefore can be changed. The process for change is
mostly through social processes and interactions: If my peer circle
says there is no climate change, I agree because I want to belong to
the circle, it is important to me to be accepted in it, INDEPENDENTLY
of what the prevalent or scientifically true view is--it doesn't really
matter because it is not a core value. In fact, studies show that if a
trusted leader of a social circle changes their view, the circle can
change it too, unless there is a personal interest in keeping the old
view. The hardest part is, of course, for that leader to step up and do
the right thing.
